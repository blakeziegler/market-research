The company's return on assets and equity are also relatively low, which could indicate inefficient use of resources. Furthermore, the PEG ratio of 1.8 suggests that the company may be overvalued considering its current growth rate. Lastly, the company is trading near its 52 week high, which may indicate a higher risk for new investors. **Given these factors, my recommendation would be to sell EnviroClean at this time.**"

The company's P/E ratio of 15 and EV/EBITA of 10 suggest fair valuation. However, the low Return on Assets (5%) and a moderate Return on Equity (10%) indicate a relatively inefficient use of resources.
