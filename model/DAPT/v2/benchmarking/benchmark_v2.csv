- Net Income: $90M
- Operating Cash Flow: $35M
- Capital Expenditures: $25M
- Free Cash Flow: $10M

Despite reporting strong net income, the company’s cash flow is significantly lower. Explain the possible causes of this discrepancy and whether it raises any red flags about earnings quality."
"You are evaluating a firm with the following data:

- Return on Equity (ROE): 18%
- Retention Ratio: 60%
- Return on Invested Capital (ROIC): 14%

Evaluate how margin compression is affecting profitability. Should investors be concerned? What underlying causes might explain this change?"
"A SaaS firm has shown impressive top-line growth over the last two years:

- Year 1 Revenue: $120M
- Year 2 Revenue: $180M
- Net Income (Year 2): $12M
- Operating Cash Flow (Year 2): $8M
- Deferred Revenue: $50M
- CapEx: $25M

Despite strong revenue growth, operating cash flow remains weak. Assess the quality of growth and whether it's sustainable. What risks or strengths can be inferred from this pattern?"
"A company reported:

- ROIC: 11.5%
- WACC: 8.5%
- Net Operating Profit After Tax (NOPAT): $90M
- Invested Capital: $780M

Determine whether the company is creating or destroying shareholder value. Discuss how large the value spread is and what it implies for long-term investment potential."
"The company reported:

- Net Income: $60M
- Operating Cash Flow: $20M
- Changes in Working Capital: -$5M
- Depreciation & Amortization: $10M

Evaluate the quality of earnings. Are profits being backed by real cash flow, or do accruals dominate? How should this influence investor confidence in the reported figures?"
"A company is being valued using a DCF model with these assumptions:

- Year 5 EBITDA: $240M
- Exit Multiple: 10x
- WACC: 9%
- Terminal Value Contribution to Total EV: 70%

Assess whether the terminal value assumption is too aggressive. How sensitive is the valuation to the terminal multiple, and what would be a more conservative scenario?"

- EBITDA: $300M
- Interest Expense: $80M
- Principal Repayments (Next 12 months): $120M
