"A company is being valued using a DCF model with these assumptions:

- Year 5 EBITDA: $240M
- Exit Multiple: 10x
- WACC: 9%
- Terminal Value Contribution to Total EV: 70%
- Current Enterprise Value: $1.6B

Assess whether the terminal value assumption is too aggressive. How sensitive is the valuation to the terminal multiple, and what would be a more conservative scenario?","The model should work for all scenarios.

Assume that there will be no growth in EBITDA or capital expenditures after year 5.

Solution: The formula for calculating terminal value (TV) is as follows:

TV = EBITDA(5) / WACC

Given the information provided, we can calculate TV as follows:

TV = ($240M / 9%) = $2.67B This means that if the firm were sold at the end of year 5, its enterprise value would be equal to its current EV plus the terminal value. In other words, the total enterprise value would be $4.27B ($1.60B + $2.67B). Since this amount seems unrealistic given the industry context, it indicates that either the exit multiple or WACC used in the calculation was incorrect. Let us assume that the correct WACC is 11%, which makes sense considering higher risk associated with smaller companies. Then, we can recalculate TV: TV = ($240M / 11%) = $2.18B This reduces the total enterprise value to $3.78B, which appears more reasonable given the size of the company. Therefore, we conclude that while the original estimate may have been overestimating the firm's value, adjusting the inputs could lead to a more accurate result."

- No Dividend

Evaluate whether the valuation is justified using the PEG ratio. Is this growth priced reasonably, or does the stock appear overvalued relative to its fundamentals?","Assume no other information available.

---

# Solution

The PEG ratio is calculated by dividing the price-to-earnings ratio by the earnings growth rate. In this case, it would be 85 / 0.4 = 212.5. This indicates that the company's current P/E multiple reflects high growth expectations. However, given the relatively low retention rate and lack of dividends, there may be some uncertainty surrounding future cash flows. Additionally, while a PEG ratio above 1 could indicate potential overvaluation, it can also be due to differing methodologies in calculating earnings and P/E ratios across different industries. It's important to consider these factors when interpreting the results before making an investment decision.

In conclusion, while the high PEG ratio suggests possible overvaluation, further analysis into other financial metrics such as retention rates and dividend policies should be conducted before reaching any firm conclusions about the company's value."

"A regional bank reports:

- Net Interest Income: $780M
- Average Earning Assets: $25B
- Net Interest Margin: 3.12%
- Loan Loss Provisions: $120M
- Tier 1 Capital Ratio: 10.5%

Evaluate the bank’s earnings quality and credit risk exposure. Is the Net Interest Margin sustainable, and how does capital adequacy influence valuation under a residual income model?","If you use any external sources or websites for your research, include those sources in your answer.

### Solution

The key ratios that need to be calculated to evaluate the bank's earnings quality and credit risk exposure are:

Net interest margin (NIM): This ratio measures the difference between average earning assets and total interest charges divided by average earning assets. It indicates the proportion of net interest income earned on earning assets. The higher the NIM, the more profitable the bank is likely to be. For this case, we calculate NIM as follows:

Average earning assets = ($25 billion) / 2 = $12.5 billion Total interest charges = $780 million - $120 million (loan loss provision) = $660 million NIM = ($660 million) / $12.5 billion = 5.28% The calculated NIM of 5.28% indicates that the bank has a relatively low level of profitability compared to other banks. A lower NIM may indicate that the bank is charging less interest than its competitors, which could lead to lower profits. On the other hand, it could also mean that the bank has more reserves set aside for potential loan losses. To determine whether the bank has sufficient reserves to cover potential losses, we can look at its loan loss provisions. In this case, we see that the loan loss provision was only $120 million out of total interest charges of $780 million. This suggests that while there were some bad loans, they did not account for most of the bank's net interest income. However, if there had been significant write-offs due to high levels of non-performing loans (NPLs), then the bank would have reported lower total interest charges and a higher NIM. Thus, further analysis into the nature and composition of the bank's loan portfolio would be necessary to provide a complete picture. Tier 1 capital ratio: This ratio measures the amount of equity capital available to absorb losses relative to risk-weighted assets. Higher levels of capital imply greater financial stability and resilience against economic shocks. Here, we calculate the Tier 1 capital ratio as follows: Tier 1 capital ratio = (Tier 1 capital) / Risk-weighted assets Where Tier 1 capital includes common stockholders' equity plus retained earnings, surplus funds, general reserves, and tax-equivalent unrealized gains and losses on qualifying securities. In this case, we know that the bank had a Tier 1 capital ratio of 10.5%. This implies that the bank has enough regulatory capital to withstand moderate levels of economic stress without impairing its ability to meet customer demands. However, given the current macroeconomic conditions and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the bank may want to consider increasing its capital cushion to maintain adequate liquidity during times of uncertainty. Residual income model: We can use the residual income model to estimate the fair value of the bank based on its current profitability and capital structure. The formula is: Fair value = Book value + Present value of expected future residual income Using the information provided above, we can estimate the present value of future residual income as follows: Expected future residual income = (Net profit after taxes) - (Interest paid) Present value of future residual income = Present value factor x Expected future residual income Assuming an appropriate discount rate and assuming no growth in future cash flows, we can estimate the fair value of the bank as follows: Fair value = Book value + Present value of future residual income = ($12.5 billion) + ($780 million - $120 million) x Present Value Factor = $13.32 billion

In summary, based on the given information, we conclude that while the bank appears to have adequate reserves to cover potential losses and maintains an acceptable level of capitalization, its low Net Interest Margin and lack of transparency regarding the composition of its loan portfolio raise concerns about its overall health and sustainability. Further investigation is needed before drawing firm conclusions regarding its valuation or investment suitability."

- FCF Yield: 9%
- Production Growth Forecast: Flat
- Oil Price Assumption: $75/barrel
- Terminal Value Contribution: 65% of DCF EV

Analyze whether the FCF yield offers a margin of safety. Is the terminal value too sensitive to commodity price assumptions? Would a NAV-based valuation be more appropriate for this type of business?","You may use any calculations or formulas you want.

I would recommend using the following formula when calculating the value of an asset using free cash flow:

$$V = \frac{FCF_{1}}{(WACC - g)} + \sum_{t=2}^n\frac{FCF_t}{(1+r)^{t-1}}$$

Where:

$V$: Present Value of all future cash flows

$FCF$: Future cash flow at time t

$g$: Long-term growth rate

$r$: Discount rate (equal to WACC)

$n$: Number of years until terminal year

In this case, we can calculate the present value of each year's cash flows by plugging in our known values into the equation:

$$PV = \frac{FCF_1}{(WACC - g)} + \sum_{t=2}^{10}\frac{FCF_t}{(1+WACC)^{t-1}}$$

$$= \frac{3.6B}{(0.09 - 0.04)} + \sum_{t=2}^{10}\frac{3.6B}{(1+0.09)^{t-1}}$$

"A B2B SaaS company disclosed:

- Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC): $3,200  
- Average Revenue Per User (ARPU): $1,100/year  
- Gross Margin: 75%  
- Churn Rate: 8% annually  
- Retention Rate: 92%  
- Revenue Growth: 28%

Calculate the CAC payback period and LTV/CAC ratio. Based on these, assess the scalability and economic moat of the business. How should these metrics influence a DCF or rule-of-40 valuation?","*Note*: This is an advanced question for experienced professionals.

Solution: The key assumptions here are as follows:

    - Annual customer churn rate = 8%
    - ARPU = 1100 / year
    - Gross margin = 750% -> cost price per unit = 250%
    
    In order to calculate the lifetime value of each customer (LTV), we need to estimate how long they will continue paying us for our services. Let's assume that customers stay with us indefinitely but after some point their usage starts declining exponentially until they leave completely. We can use a simple formula like this to represent it: 

    Lifetime Value = total revenue earned from customer ÷ average revenue per month
    
    Where, average revenue per month = annual revenue ÷ number of months in year (12)
    
    Hence, Lifetime Value = total revenue earned from customer ÷ monthly revenue x 12
    
    So let's put all these together now: 
    
    CAC Payback Period (CPP) = Total Costs incurred to acquire one new customer ÷ Monthly Revenue

    CPP = ($3200) ÷ ($1100/12) = 27.73 months

    Lifetime Value (LTV) = ($1100 x 12) ÷ ($1100/12) = $13200

    LTV/CAC Ratio = $13,200 ÷ $32,000 = 0.41

    Scalability Indicator (SI) = ($1100 * 12) / $32,000 = 3.50

    Economic Moat (EM) = ($1100 * 12) / ($1100 * 12 + ($1100/12)) = 91.66%

    Based on these calculations, we can say that while this company may have good short term prospects due to its high gross margins, it does not appear very scalable nor sustainable in terms of generating enough profits to cover its overhead costs over time. Furthermore, given such low ratios compared to other similar businesses in its space, we might conclude that there isn't much room for growth or expansion without significant investments being made into improving efficiency or finding ways to increase prices charged to end users. Finally, considering just how quickly these numbers drop off once past certain thresholds, I'd argue against using either dcf or roP valuations alone without additional context about industry dynamics etc.."
"A regulated utility company pays a stable dividend and reports:

- Annual Dividend per Share: $2.10  
- Dividend Growth Rate: 2.5%  
- Cost of Equity: 6.5%  
- Payout Ratio: 85%  
- ROE: 7%

Value the company using the Gordon Growth (DDM) model. Comment on whether the current payout is sustainable and how regulatory constraints influence valuation accuracy.","Your answer must be based only on the information provided in the question, so use it wisely!

Solution: The key assumption here is that dividends can grow at a constant rate forever, which may not hold true for all companies but seems reasonable given these assumptions. We start by calculating intrinsic value using DDM formula:

    V = D / r - g

Where V is the stock price, D is the annual dividend, r is cost of equity, and g is growth rate. Substituting values gives:

    V = 2.10 / 0.065 - 0.025 = $34.92

This implies that investors require a return higher than average risk-free interest rates because they expect more upside potential beyond the forecasted future cash flows. However, there are several factors affecting this calculation such as tax advantages or subsidies offered by government entities that may increase value above computed level. Another point worth mentioning is that although payout ratio looks high (85%) compared to industry standards (40-60%), it might still be achievable due to strong balance sheet and predictable earnings profile. Overall, I believe current payout strategy appears sustainable while recognizing some limitations associated with perpetual growth models when applied to individual stocks."
