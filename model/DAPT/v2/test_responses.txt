RESPONSE 1:

In order to calculate the intrinsic value of the software company, we need to first forecast its free cash flows for the next five years.
We can do this by using the following formula:
``FCEF = FCF(0) * (1+g)^n``
where:
- FCEF is the forecasted cash flow for the next five years
- FCF(0) is the current free cash flow
- g is the growth rate
- n is the number of years

Given that the company has a net income margin of 18% and a free cash flow margin of 22%, we can assume that its free cash 
flow will be $0.18 * 1.2 billion = $216 million. Its free cash flow for the first year will be $216 million * (1 + 10%)^1 = $236.4 million. 
Therefore, its forecasted free cash flows for the next five years are:
``FCF(1) = $236.4 million
FCF(2) = $236.4 million * (1+10%)^2 = $259.9 million
FCF(3) = $259.9 million * (1+10%)^3 = $286.1 million
FCF(4) = $286.1 million * (1+10%)^4 = $314.8 million
FCF(5) = $314.8 million * (1+10%)^5 = $345.9 million``
Next, we need to calculate the terminal value using a P/E-based approach. To do this, we need to estimate the earnings of the company in 
year 5. We can estimate its earnings using the following formula:
``Earnings = FCF(5) * (1 - (1 - Profit Margin) * g)
``
where:
- Earnings is the estimated earnings for year 5
- FCF(5) is the forecasted free cash flow for year 5
- Profit Margin is the company's profit margin
Given that the company's profit margin is 18%, its estimated earnings for year 5 are:
``Earnings = $345.9 million * (1 - (1 - 0.18) * 0.10) = $332.2 million``
Therefore, its estimated P/E ratio for year 5 is:
``P/E = $6.8 billion / $332.2 million = 20.6``
Since the appropriate discount rate for this business is 9%, its terminal value is:
``TV = P/E * Earnings / (1 + k)^5
= 20.6 * $332.2 million / (1 + 0.09)^5
= $6.9 billion``

Finally, we need to calculate the total firm value by adding the present value of cash flows and terminal value, and then subtracting net debt:
``Firm Value = PV(CF) + TV - Net Debt
= PV($236.4 million + $259.9 million + $286.1 million + $314.8 million) + $6.9 billion - $150 million - $100 million
= $1.96 billion + $6.9 billion - $250 million
= $8.6 billion``
Since the company's market cap is $6.8 billion, its equity value is $8.6 billion - $6.8 billion = $1.8 billion. 
Therefore, the company appears to be overvalued, as its equity value is significantly higher than its market cap. However, 
the valuation is quite sensitive to assumptions like P/E ratio, FCF growth, and profit margins. For example, if the company's 
profit margin is 20% instead of 18%, its equity value would be $1.8 billion - $150 million - $100 million = $1.5 billion, which is still 
significantly higher than its market cap.
