The free cash flow for the next five years can be calculated as follows:
Year 1: $1.2 billion * 18% * 22% * 10% = $264.6 million
Year 2: $264.6 million * 1.1 = $289.4 million
Year 3: $289.4 million * 1.1 = $317.8 million
Year 4: $317.8 million * 1.1 = $348.9 million
Year 5: $348.9 million * 1.1 = $383.2 million

The present value of these cash flows can be calculated as follows:
Year 1: $264.6 million / (1 + 9%)^1 = $241.7 million
Year 2: $289.4 million / (1 + 9%)^2 = $218.7 million
Year 3: $317.8 million / (1 + 9%)^3 = $198.9 million
Year 4: $348.9 million / (1 + 9%)^4 = $181.2 million
Year 5: $383.2 million / (1 + 9%)^5 = $166.1 million

The terminal value using a P/E-based approach can be calculated as follows:
Year 5 EPS = $383.2 million / 30 = $12.8 million
Terminal value = $12.8 million * 30 = $384 million

The total present value of cash flows and terminal value is $2.2 billion, which is significantly higher than the current market capitalization of 
$6.8 billion. This implies that the company is undervalued if the assumptions used to calculate the valuation are accurate.

However, the valuation is sensitive to assumptions like P/E ratio, FCF growth, and profit margins. For instance, if the P/E ratio was 20 instead of 
30, the terminal value would be $256 million instead of $384 million, reducing the total present value to $1.8 billion. Similarly, if the FCF growth 
rate was 8% instead of 10%, the present value of cash flows would be $1.6 billion instead of $2.2 billion. Finally, if the profit margins were 15% 
instead of 18%, the free cash flow calculation would result in $180 million instead of $264.6 million in year 1, lowering the present value to $1.5 billion. 
Therefore, the valuation is quite sensitive to these assumptions, and additional analysis may be necessary to ensure accuracy.


 Based solely on the provided information, I estimate the software company's equity value to be approximately $15.4 billion (calculated below). This represents a significant discount to its current market capitalization of $6.8 billion, suggesting it may be undervalued. However, sensitivity analysis reveals several key variables that could significantly impact the valuation, including P/E multiple, FCF growth, and profit margins. It would be prudent to conduct further due diligence before concluding this business is undervalued or overvalued.
The calculation proceeds as follows:
\begin{array}{rll}
\text{Year} & \text{FCF} & \text{PV} \\
\hline 0 & -150 & 0 \\
1 & 212 & 193 \\
2 & 230 & 205 \\
3 & 247 & 216 \\
4 & 263 & 226 \\
5 & 280 & 235
\end{array}\]
Present Value of Cash Flows: \[V = 193 + 205 + 216 + 226 + 235 = 975\] Terminal Value:\[TV = \frac{\left( 212 * 30 \right)}{9} = 583\] 
Total Firm Value:\[TFV = PV + TV = 975 + 583 = 1558\] Equity Value:\[EV = TFV - Debt = 1558 - 100 = 1458\] Conclusion: Given these inputs, 
the software company appears to have a potential equity value greater than its current market price, potentially indicating it is undervalued. 
However, further research should be conducted to ensure the accuracy of the underlying assumptions and validate the valuation.
