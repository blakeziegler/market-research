Carvana has achieved a remarkable turnaround, transitioning from a period of restructuring to becoming the fastest-growing and most profitable public automotive retailer, demonstrating the power of its vertically integrated e-commerce model.
Record Q1 2025 results, including $4.23 billion in revenue, $373 million in net income, and $488 million in Adjusted EBITDA (11.5% margin), underscore significant fundamental gains in unit economics and operational efficiency.
Proprietary technology, including the online platform, advanced imaging, and logistics software, provides a quantifiable competitive advantage, enabling faster transactions, improved efficiency, and a differentiated customer experience against traditional and online rivals.
Strategic integration of ADESA sites into "Megasites" significantly expands reconditioning capacity and logistics reach, providing a clear, capital-light path to support future growth towards the long-term objective of 3 million annual retail units.
Management is guiding for sequential increases in retail units and Adjusted EBITDA in Q2 2025 and significant growth for the full year 2025, with a long-term objective of 3 million annual retail sales at a 13.5% Adjusted EBITDA margin within 5-10 years, prioritizing growth over margin within reasonable ranges.

Carvana Co. set out with an ambitious mission: to fundamentally change the way people buy and sell cars. Launched in 2013, the company pioneered an end-to-end e-commerce platform for used vehicles, aiming to offer consumers a seamless, transparent, and convenient alternative to traditional dealerships.
This vision fueled a period of rapid growth, with the company expanding its footprint and building a complex, vertically integrated operational network encompassing vehicle acquisition, inspection, reconditioning, online merchandising, financing, and last-mile delivery.
The journey has not been without significant challenges. Following a phase of aggressive expansion, particularly around the 2022 acquisition of ADESA, macroeconomic headwinds and operational complexities led to substantial losses and necessitated a period of intense restructuring throughout 2022 and 2023.
This challenging period, however, appears to have forged a more resilient and efficient organization. Over the past year, Carvana has demonstrated a remarkable turnaround, successfully pairing its differentiated customer experience with significantly improved operational and financial performance.
This has propelled the company to a position where it is simultaneously achieving industry-leading growth rates and profitability among public automotive retailers.

At the heart of Carvana's strategy lies its proprietary technology and vertically integrated operational model. The company's e-commerce platform allows customers to complete the entire car buying process online, from browsing a vast inventory with patented 360-degree vehicle tours and high-definition photography that highlights imperfections, to securing financing through a proprietary loan origination system, trading in a vehicle, and scheduling delivery or vending machine pickup.
This technological foundation provides tangible, quantifiable benefits. The online platform enables faster transaction processing times compared to traditional methods, enhancing customer convenience. The proprietary credit scoring and deal structuring algorithms allow for near-instantaneous financing terms tailored to individual customers.
The in-house logistics software and nationwide network of multi-car and single-car haulers, operating on a hub-and-spoke model, optimize routes and transport, aiming to reduce delivery times and costs. Management has highlighted that average time to delivery was down about 25% year-over-year in 2024, a direct result of system efficiencies and getting cars closer to customers.
The acquisition of ADESA in 2022 significantly bolstered Carvana's physical infrastructure, providing access to 56 auction sites. The strategic integration of these sites into "Megasites," combining wholesale auction capabilities with Carvana's Inspection and Reconditioning Center (IRC) processes, is a key operational initiative.
These integrations are being executed with minimal CapEx and relatively short lead times (approximately 90 days), leveraging existing ADESA buildings and land. This expands Carvana's overall production capacity, with existing IRCs and integrated ADESA sites having the capacity to inspect and recondition over 1 million vehicles annually, and the total real estate footprint capable of supporting over 3 million units at full utilization.
Getting reconditioning capabilities closer to customers through these sites shortens inbound and outbound shipping distances, which management noted reduced average shipping distances by about 300 miles in integrated markets, contributing to lower logistics costs and faster delivery options, including the expansion of same-day delivery to new markets like Denver and New Jersey.
The development of ADESA Clear, a proprietary digital wholesale auction product leveraging Carvana's technology, further enhances the company's ability to efficiently manage wholesale inventory and potentially partner with commercial sellers.

Carvana's recent financial performance reflects the successful execution of its efficiency and growth strategies. For the first quarter of 2025, the company reported net sales and operating revenues of $4.23 billion, a significant 38.3% increase compared to $3.06 billion in Q1 2024.
This growth was primarily driven by a 45.7% surge in retail units sold, reaching 133,898 vehicles. Profitability metrics show a dramatic improvement. Gross profit for Q1 2025 was $929 million, up 57.2% year-over-year, resulting in a gross profit margin of 22.0%.
Retail vehicle gross profit per unit increased by 4.0% to $3,204, driven by lower reconditioning and inbound transport costs and lower depreciation rates. Wholesale gross profit also saw strong growth, increasing 40.5% to $111 million, supported by higher wholesale units sold and increased wholesale marketplace activity.
Other gross profit, primarily from finance receivables and complementary products, jumped 69.9% to $389 million, benefiting from increased loan sales, higher loan sale spreads, and improved attachment rates for products like VSCs.
The focus on operational efficiency is clearly visible in selling, general, and administrative (SGA) expenses. While total SGA increased by 17.3% to $535 million in Q1 2025, this was significantly outpaced by retail unit growth, leading to a substantial reduction in non-GAAP SGA expense per retail unit sold, which declined by $750 year-over-year in Q1 2025.
The culmination of these improvements is reflected in the company's bottom line. Carvana

including inflation, interest rates, and potential economic slowdowns, can significantly affect consumer demand for used vehicles and the affordability of financing.
While management believes their improved efficiency and profitability position them better to handle such fluctuations than in the past, a severe downturn could still pressure sales volume and margins.

Competition remains intense in the fragmented automotive retail market.
Traditional dealers and other online platforms continue to adapt their strategies, and increased competition could lead to pricing pressure or higher customer acquisition costs.
Carvana's ability to maintain its differentiated offering and execute on its efficiency initiatives is crucial in this environment.

The company carries a substantial amount of debt, which exposes it to interest rate risk and limits financial flexibility compared to less leveraged competitors.
While recent debt management actions and improving profitability are addressing this, the ability to continue deleveraging and improve credit ratios over time is important for long-term stability.

Operational execution risk is inherent in scaling a complex, vertically integrated business.
Achieving the ambitious growth targets requires successfully ramping up reconditioning throughput, optimizing logistics, and maintaining high levels of customer service across a much larger volume of transactions.
Challenges in any part of this chain could lead to inefficiencies or impact the customer experience.

Legal proceedings and regulatory compliance, particularly related to vehicle titling and registration, also pose ongoing risks.

Carvana's journey has been one of rapid growth, challenging setbacks, and ultimately, a compelling turnaround.
The company's proprietary technology and vertically integrated model provide a unique foundation in the fragmented automotive retail market, enabling a differentiated customer experience and driving significant operational efficiencies.
Recent financial results, particularly the record performance in Q1 2025, demonstrate that the company has successfully translated hard-fought lessons into tangible improvements in profitability and unit economics.
With a clear path to leveraging existing infrastructure, expanding reconditioning capacity through ADESA integrations, and continuing to drive fundamental gains, Carvana is now firmly focused on a strategy of profitable growth.
The long-term objective of reaching 3 million annual retail units at a 13.5% Adjusted EBITDA margin within 5-10 years is ambitious but appears achievable, supported by management's confidence and the demonstrated ability to accelerate growth while improving profitability.
The investment thesis hinges on Carvana's ability to continue executing against its operational and strategic plans, effectively scaling its unique model, and navigating competitive pressures and macroeconomic uncertainties.
While risks related to debt, competition, and execution remain, the company's recent performance and stated objectives suggest a compelling opportunity for significant value creation as it seeks to become the largest and most profitable player in the vast used car market.
The coming quarters will be critical in demonstrating sustained momentum and progress towards these long-term goals.

reported GAAP operating income of $394 million in Q1 2025, a significant increase from $134 million in Q1 2024, resulting in a GAAP operating margin of 9.3%. Net income attributable to Carvana Co. was $216 million ($1.61 per basic share, $1.51 per diluted share) in Q1 2025, a substantial improvement from $28 million ($0.24 per basic share, $0.23 per diluted share) in the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA reached a record $488 million in Q1 2025, up from $235 million in Q1 2024, achieving an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.5%. This places Carvana well within its long-term target range and demonstrates significant leverage potential.

Liquidity also appears robust. As of March 31, 2025, Carvana held $1.86 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $46 million in restricted cash, totaling $1.90 billion. The company had $1.40 billion in unused capacity under its Floor Plan Facility and $2.70 billion in unused capacity under its Finance Receivable Facilities. Subsequent to the quarter end, Carvana amended its Master Purchase and Sale Agreement with Ally to reestablish a commitment to purchase up to $4.0 billion of finance receivables between April 30, 2025, and April 29, 2026, and amended its Floor Plan Facility with Ally to renew the line of credit at $1.5 billion until April 30, 2027, with improved interest rates and restricted cash requirements. These actions bolster the company's financing capabilities and liquidity position. Total debt outstanding was $5.50 billion as of March 31, 2025, relatively stable compared to year-end 2024.

Carvana operates in the highly competitive and fragmented U.S. automotive retail industry, which sees approximately 40 million used vehicle transactions annually. While the top 10 used auto retailers account for less than 10% of the market share, Carvana's estimated 2-3% share positions it as a significant player, albeit still with substantial room for growth. Carvana's primary competitive advantage lies in its differentiated e-commerce model and proprietary technology stack, which contrasts sharply with the hybrid or traditional models of major competitors like AutoNation, CarMax, Sonic Automotive, and Group 1 Automotive. While these competitors leverage extensive physical dealership networks and are increasingly adopting omnichannel strategies, Carvana's pure-play online approach offers a unique value proposition centered on convenience, transparency, and selection. Quantitatively, Carvana's recent revenue growth rates (38.3% in Q1 2025) significantly outpace those of its publicly traded peers, who typically report growth in the single to low double digits. This suggests Carvana is effectively taking market share. However, traditional competitors like AutoNation, CarMax, Sonic, and Group 1 have historically demonstrated more stable and higher net profitability margins (typically 2-4%) compared to Carvana's recent shift to profitability (2.68% TTM net margin). Their established scale and diversified revenue streams (including service and parts) provide a degree of financial resilience. Carvana's higher debt levels also present a vulnerability compared to the generally lower debt-to-equity ratios of its peers. Carvana's technological edge, such as its efficient online transaction process and logistics optimization, aims to drive lower operating costs per unit over time, potentially eroding the cost advantages of competitors' scale. The integration of ADESA sites further enhances this by reducing transport costs and increasing reconditioning efficiency. While competitors like CarMax have invested in online tools and no-haggle pricing, Carvana's end-to-end digital experience and unique fulfillment options (vending machines, home delivery) remain key differentiators. Indirect competitors, including new car sales (impacted by players like Tesla's direct model) and alternative transportation options, also influence the market dynamic. However, Carvana's focus on the large used car market and its ability to offer a wide selection across various makes and models positions it to benefit from shifts in consumer preference within that segment. Overall, Carvana strategically positions itself as the digital leader, leveraging technology and vertical integration to offer a superior customer experience and drive operational efficiency. While it currently lags peers in financial stability metrics like net margin and debt ratios, its rapid growth and improving profitability suggest a path to closing this gap and potentially establishing a new, more efficient standard for automotive retail.

Carvana's management is optimistic about the path ahead, guiding for continued growth and profitability. For the second quarter of 2025, the company expects a sequential increase in both retail units sold and Adjusted EBITDA compared to Q1 2025. Looking at the full fiscal year 2025, management anticipates significant growth in both retail units sold and Adjusted EBITDA compared to 2024. This positive outlook is based on the assumption that the macroeconomic environment remains stable. Management believes they have clear visibility to achieving these targets, driven by the momentum from Q1, continued operational efficiency gains, the benefits of increasing inventory selection, and the leverage provided by their existing infrastructure. Beyond the near term, Carvana has set a bold long-term objective: to reach 3 million annual retail sales with a 13.5% Adjusted EBITDA margin within the next 5 to 10 years. Management describes this goal as "very exciting and very achievable." Achieving this scale would represent a significant increase from current levels and imply capturing a much larger share of the U.S. used car market. The strategy to reach this target involves prioritizing growth over margin within reasonable ranges. As Carvana continues to unlock fundamental gains in efficiency and unit economics, management anticipates passing a significant portion of this value back to customers, either through more competitive pricing, improved financing terms, or further investments in enhancing the customer experience (simplicity, speed, selection). This is expected to fuel demand and drive the necessary volume growth. The existing reconditioning and real estate capacity, particularly from the ADESA acquisition, provides the operational foundation to support this scaling efficiently, without the need for proportional increases in fixed costs.
