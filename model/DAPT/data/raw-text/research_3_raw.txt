Valuation Methods
While there is a large universe of valuation methods to choose from when converting a forecast to a valuation, a useful classification is that of sophisticated and unsophisticated valuation methods. Sophisticated valuation methods are based on the net present value (NPV) of the financial performance of multiple future periods. Unsophisticated valuation methods are simpler heuristic methods based on the multiple of a single period’s performance measure relative to comparable firms. Examples of sophisticated methods include Discounted Cash Flow (DCF), Residual Income Valuation (RIV), and the Dividend Discounting Model (DDM). Examples of unsophisticated methods include Price/Earnings (P/E), Price/Sales (P/S), Price/Cash Flow (P/CF), and for enterprise valuation, Enterprise Value/Earnings (EV/E), Enterprise Value/Sales (EV/S), and Enterprise Value/Cash Flow (EV/CF).

The theoretical literature supports the superiority of sophisticated valuation methods. Textbooks such as Financial Statement Analysis and Security Valuation and Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies advocate for sophisticated methods. Authors like Copeland, Koller, and Murrin emphasize the advantages of the DCF approach over earnings multiples. Penman critiques multiples-based methods, highlighting conceptual problems: they rely on comparables, assume market efficiency, and become circular if all firms are priced relative to each other. He questions the rationale of valuing a company based on comparables if the market is assumed to be efficient.

Despite the preference in theory, this thesis takes an empirical approach to examine the actual choice of valuation methods in takeovers and among sell-side analysts.

Valuation can be a detailed process with several steps. Penman outlines a five-step process:
	1.	Knowing the business
	2.	Analyzing information (financial and non-financial)
	3.	Developing forecasts
	4.	Converting forecasts to a valuation
	5.	Trading on the valuation

This thesis focuses primarily on step 4—converting forecasts into valuations—while other essays focus on the earlier steps.

Analysts
Although the thesis focuses on valuation rather than individual actors, financial analysts play a critical role in price discovery. Sell-side analysts, who work for brokerage and investment banking firms, are the most common type. They produce reports, issue recommendations, and forecast earnings. They serve the clients of their firms and are called sell-side because they are affiliated with firms selling securities.

Buy-side analysts work for the clients of these brokerage firms—mutual funds, trusts, and large investment firms. They make investment recommendations but do not usually publish reports or issue forecasts. Buy-side analysts often cover more stocks than sell-side analysts and depend in part on sell-side reports.

Research has shown that sell-side analysts often display optimistic bias, issuing more buy than sell recommendations. This bias can be attributed to their incentive to boost trading volume and maintain good relationships with company management. For example, analysts working for underwriters tend to give more favorable recommendations.

The role of analysts is as intermediaries who gather, interpret, and disseminate information. DeFranco studied whether analysts are substitutes or complements to firm disclosures and found they are primarily substitutes, although they also collect private information.

Value Relevance and Valuation Relevance
Valuation is about translating information into value. For markets to function efficiently, useful information must be available to investors and analysts. One way to assess usefulness is through value relevance, which measures the correlation between specific information and stock returns. For example, the relationship between earnings and returns has been widely studied.

However, value relevance has limitations. It struggles to capture the usefulness of non-financial information like customer relationships or brand strength. These aspects may be highly relevant to valuation but are not easily measured through correlations with returns.

This thesis introduces the concept of valuation relevance, which refers to whether a piece of information is used in the valuation process. If it is used, it is deemed useful. This measure is practical for complex information that does not show up clearly in price correlations.

For example, if a non-financial data point is included in an analyst’s report, it is considered valuation relevant. While analysts do not include all relevant information in reports, what is included is more likely to be deemed important. Therefore, valuation relevance provides an intuitive, if imperfect, way to assess information usefulness.

Reliability also matters. Non-financial information must be reliable to be useful. While not explicitly addressed, the empirical work in this thesis implies that analysts use non-financial information they consider both relevant and reliable.

Research Question
The overarching goal of this thesis is to explore the equity valuation process. The core research question is: How is equity valued? This broad question is divided into specific sub-questions:
Takeovers are significant due to their scale. Valuations in takeovers matter because they lead to real offers for all outstanding shares, affecting market outcomes.
Sell-side analysts are influential in capital markets, interpreting information and guiding investment decisions. Understanding the methods they use provides insight into market behavior.
If analysts differ in their valuation approaches, identifying why helps clarify the market’s functioning and analyst decision-making.
As markets shift from traditional financial disclosures to broader business reporting, including intellectual capital and intangible assets, it becomes crucial to understand how this type of information enters valuation models.
Understanding the role of non-financial information in analyst valuations is essential to gauge its impact on market pricing and investor decision-making.



Essay 1 “On the Use of Valuation Methods in Takeovers”
The first essay explores how acquiring companies value target companies during takeovers and which valuation methods they use. The analysis is based on four surveys conducted in 1990, 1994, 1996, and 2004. Surveys were sent to CFOs of Swedish companies. In 1990, the sample included 479 firms that had completed acquisitions in the previous year. The later surveys targeted companies listed on the Stockholm Stock Exchange. Across all four surveys, there were 535 responses, yielding an average response rate of 46.4%. Respondents specified which valuation method they used for their most recent acquisition and explained their choice.

Findings from the surveys show a dramatic increase in the use of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model, which became the most used method by 2004. This behavior differs from that of sell-side analysts and fund managers, who tend to favor Price/Earnings and other relative valuation models. The study suggests companies in takeover scenarios use more sophisticated methods. One explanation is that acquiring firms typically have access to private information about the target, reducing uncertainty in DCF forecasts. They also devote more time and resources to valuation than sell-side analysts who must cover multiple companies.

Essay 2 “The Reasons Why Analysts Use Unsophisticated Valuation Methods”
This essay examines the valuation methods used by sell-side analysts. In contrast to acquiring firms in takeovers, analysts mostly rely on unsophisticated methods such as Price/Earnings and rarely use models like DCF or DDM.

The study analyzes 260 sell-side analyst reports and confirms that unsophisticated methods dominate. It tests four common explanations for this behavior: (1) lack of knowledge, (2) cost-benefit tradeoffs, (3) uncertainty in forecasting, and (4) relative target pricing. None of these factors adequately explain the variation in the sample.

However, results do support two factors: the analyst’s brokerage firm and the industry of the target company. The brokerage effect may relate to the differing needs of brokerage clients. Industry variation may be influenced by different growth characteristics.

Essay 3 “The Sell Side – Observations on Indicators of Intellectual Capital”
The third essay continues the exploration of analyst behavior but shifts focus to forecasting inputs rather than valuation methods. Specifically, it studies how analysts use indicators of Intellectual Capital (IC) to evaluate future performance not visible in financial statements.

Content analysis was conducted on 250 analyst reports covering randomly selected S&P 500 companies. IC indicators were identified and categorized. Results show analysts frequently reference IC indicators, especially relational capital (e.g. customer relationships), more than human or structural capital. Industry plays a significant role in determining how many indicators are used. This suggests analysts see relational capital as most predictive of future cash flow generation.

Essay 4 “The Valuation Relevance of Non-Financial Information”
The fourth essay examines how non-financial information appears in analyst reports. It evaluates the presence of 70 specific non-financial items drawn from a disclosure index developed from the 1994 Jenkins Committee Report.

The essay introduces the concept of Valuation Relevance—whether a piece of information is used in the valuation process. If analysts include an item in their reports, it is deemed valuation relevant. The study finds a wide range of non-financial information used by analysts, with usage positively correlated to firm size and to the amount of non-financial information in the firm’s own annual report.

It also finds that analyst reports are more likely to include forward-looking non-financial information than historical information, suggesting a predictive intent behind its inclusion.

Conclusions and Contribution
The overarching question was: How is equity valued? This led to several sub-questions:
What valuation methods do companies use in takeovers?
What valuation methods do analysts use?
What explains variation in analyst valuation methods?
To what extent do analysts use non-financial information?

Findings:
Companies valuing takeover targets tend to use sophisticated valuation methods. In the 2004 Swedish survey, 61% used DCF models. The literature supports the superiority of sophisticated multi-period models like DCF. That companies use these models in takeovers is expected, but it’s noteworthy given the contrast with analyst behavior.

Analysts tend to favor simpler methods like Price/Earnings. This behavior persists despite DCF’s theoretical advantages. The second essay confirmed this trend by analyzing 260 analyst reports on S&P 500 firms.

Why the difference? Companies in takeovers have better access to data and more incentive to value accurately—they are purchasing the whole company. Analysts, in contrast, work with limited information and must cover many firms.

Also, DCF emphasizes liquidity and future cash flow generation, which is crucial in acquisitions.

Variation in analyst behavior across industries and brokerage firms may stem from client needs and industry-specific characteristics.

Essays 3 and 4 show analysts regularly use non-financial information—especially forward-looking relational capital indicators. This usage correlates with firm size and the firm’s own disclosure behavior. The concept of Valuation Relevance helps define information usefulness based on its inclusion in valuation reports.

This research contributes to a more detailed understanding of equity valuation across different contexts—acquisitions, analyst behavior, method choice, and information use.
A natural question to ask in light of the findings that sell-side analysts use unsophisticated valuation methods is why? Previous research has offered several explanations for why analysts rely on unsophisticated instead of sophisticated valuation methods. After confirming that analysts do in fact use unsophisticated methods, the second essay tests these previously proposed explanations.

The following explanations were tested:
	1.	A knowledge problem of the analysts
	2.	A cost-benefit tradeoff that analysts adopt
	3.	The uncertainty of future outcomes of the target company
	4.	The relative level of target prices
	5.	Brokerage firm publishing the report
	6.	Industry of the target firm

The findings in essay two did not support explanations 1 through 4. Therefore, the choice of valuation method by analysts is not explained by a knowledge gap, a cost-benefit tradeoff, future uncertainty, or target price levels. However, the tests did support the role of brokerage firm and industry. Results showed a significant relationship between brokerage and analysts’ method choice, as well as between industry and model selection. These results are difficult to interpret, but prior literature suggests brokerage effects may stem from differing client needs, and industry effects may be tied to sector-specific growth characteristics. These explanations, while plausible, were not confirmed in the study.

To what extent do sell-side analysts utilize non-financial information in their reports?

It has long been argued that users of business reporting require disclosure of relevant non-financial information—such as intellectual capital, value creation processes, and other forward-looking insights not included in financial statements. Essays three and four approach this question from the user’s standpoint by investigating what kind of information analysts include in their reports.

Both essays found that analysts do use non-financial information, as defined in essay four, and information on intellectual capital in the form of indicators, as defined in essay three. However, the type and extent of use vary significantly. With respect to intellectual capital indicators, analysts used relational capital more frequently than human or structural capital, indicating varied usefulness across categories.

Essay four also found that the 70 non-financial items in the disclosure index were not equally used, with an average of 5.33 items per report. Moreover, the frequency of non-financial disclosures in analyst reports was positively related to the non-financial content in the corresponding company’s annual report, suggesting that information accessibility drives usage. Although not tested in essay three, availability of IC indicators likely influences their inclusion.

The use and usefulness of non-financial and IC-related information is best described as contextual. Both essays demonstrate that such information varies across analyst reports based on factors like target firm industry, firm size, and brokerage firm. There are also likely endogenous factors yet to be identified by research.

This connects back to earlier discussions on market information efficiency. If information is not used by market participants like analysts, it is unlikely to be priced in by the market. If it is not reflected in prices, the information is either not predictive of future performance or the market is inefficient. Understanding what analysts use in valuation processes helps explore the qualitative aspects of market efficiency.

By answering these specific questions, the thesis lays the groundwork to approach the broader question: How is equity valued?

The findings show that equity valuation varies by context. Essay one showed that companies valuing takeover targets use sophisticated methods, notably DCF, to a greater extent than do sell-side analysts or fund managers. This likely stems from differences in the valuation environment. While the DCF model is criticized for its reliance on hard-to-estimate inputs, these challenges are mitigated in takeovers due to private access to company data during due diligence.

Valuation behavior also varies within the group of sell-side analysts. While they generally favor unsophisticated methods, essay two demonstrated systematic internal variation. Of six tested explanations, brokerage firm and industry were supported as influential variables. This confirms that method choice is contextual even within a single role type.

Regarding non-financial information and IC indicators, the thesis shows that the relevance of such information depends on firm characteristics like size and industry. Accessibility is also a key factor in determining what information is used during the valuation process.

The primary contribution of the thesis is empirical. Through observations on valuation methods in takeovers and among sell-side analysts, as well as usage of non-financial and IC-related information, it reveals how valuation practices differ both between and within market participant groups.
