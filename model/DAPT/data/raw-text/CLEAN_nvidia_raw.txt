Nvidia Earnings: Raising Our Fair Value to $130 From $105 as
AI Product Supply Is Expanding
Analyst Note Brian Colello, CPA, Strategist, 21 Nov 2024
Nvidia once again reported outstanding results for its fiscal third quarter and provided investors with a
fiscal fourth-quarter forecast that exceeded our exPEctations. We raise our fair value estimate to $130
PEr share from $105, as we ' re more optimistic about Nvidia ' s growth over the next two calendar years,
as the supply of the firm ' s products is improving faster than we exPEcted. We ' re also pleased with
management ' s commentary around its Blackwell graphics processor's gross margins once the products
are fully ramPEd, which boosts our confidence that gross margins can remain in the mid-70% range in

hardware and software tools needed to enable the exponentially growing market around artificial
intelligence. In the long run, we exPEct tech titans to strive to find SECond-sources or in-house solutions
to diversiFY away from Nvidia in AI, but most likely, these efforts will chip away at, but not supplant,
Nvidia ' s AI dominance.
Nvidia ' s GPUs handle parallel processing workloads, using many cores to efficiently process data at the
same time. In contrast, central processing units, or CPUs, such as Intel's processors for PCs and servers,
or Apple ' s processors for its Macs and iPhones, process the data of "0's and 1's" in a serial fashion. The
wheelhouse of GPUs has been the gaming market, and Nvidia ' s GPU graphics cards have long been
considered best of breed.
More recently, parallel processing has emerged as a near-requirement to accelerate AI workloads.
Nvidia took an early lead in AI GPU hardware, but more important, develoPEd a proprietary software
platform, Cuda, and these tools allow AI develoPErs to build their models with Nvidia. We believe Nvidia
not only has a hardware lead, but benefits from high customer switching costs around Cuda, making it
unlikely for another chip designer to emerge as a leader in AI training.
We think Nvidia ' s prosPEcts will be tied to the AI market, for better or worse, for quite some time. We
exPEct leading cloud vendors to continue to invest in in-house, while AMD is also working on GPUs and
AI accelerators for the data center. However, we view Nvidia ' s GPUs and Cuda as the industry leaders,
and the firm ' s massive valuation will hinge on whether, and for how long, the company can stay ahead
of the rest of the pack.

platform for AI tools, which enables develoPErs to use Nvidia's GPUs to build AI models.
Nvidia was an early leader and designer of GPUs, which were originally develoPEd to offload graphic
processing tasks on PCs and gaming consoles. Nvidia has emerged as the clear market share leader in
discrete GPUs (over 80% share, PEr Mercury Research). We attribute Nvidia's leadership to intangible
assets associated with GPU design, as well as the associated software, frameworks, and tools required
by develoPErs to work with these GPUs. Recent introductions, such as ray-tracing technology and the
use of AI tensor cores in gaming applications, are signs, in our view, that Nvidia has not lost its GPU
leadership in any way. A quick scan of GPU pricing in both gaming and data center shows that Nvidia's
average selling prices can often be twice as high as those from its closest comPEtitor, AMD.
Meanwhile, we don't foresee any emerging companies as becoming a third relevant player in the GPU
market outside of Nvidia or AMD. Even Intel, the chip industry behemoth, has struggled for many years
in trying to build a high-end GPU that would be adopted by gaming enthusiasts, and its next effort for a
discrete GPU is slated to launch in 2025. We do see integrated GPU functionality within many of Intel's
PC processors, as well as portions of Apple's and Qualcomm's system-on-chip solutions in smartphones,
but we PErceive these integrated solutions as " good enough " for nongamers, but not on par with high
end GPU needs.
GPUs PErform parallel processing, in contrast to the serial processing PErformed by central processing
units used to run the software and applications on PCs, smartphones, and many other tyPEs of devices.
CPU examples include Intel's and AMD's PC and server processors, as well as Apple's and Qualcomm's
smartphone processors. These CPUs conduct serial processing of 0's and 1's in a particular order in
order to run an instruction set to run software and PErform functions. In contrast, parallel processing
does not need to run in a linear order. This is particularly useful, for example, when capturing an image.
A GPU often has more cores than a CPU and PErforms simpler processing (such as capturing the data
within a single image pixel) but throws many more cores at the image to catch all of the data quickly. If
CPUs were to conduct this task, they would have to capture the pixels in order -- one can envision the
CPU starting at the top and working its way down the image, while the GPU takes a snapshot in full.
In our view, the nature of parallel processing in GPUs is at the heart of Nvidia's dominance in its various
end markets. PC graphics were the initial key application, allowing for more robust and immersive
gaming over the past couple of decades. Cryptocurrency mining also involves many mathematical
calculations that can run in parallel (in other words, each calculation is indePEndent of the others),
again effectively " mining " crypto faster than a CPU.
In the past decade, however, the parallel processing of GPUs was also found to more efficiently run the
matrix multiplication algorithms needed to power AI models. AI development has two key phases. The
fIRSt is AI training. Using an image recognition example, develoPErs might feed 50,000 images into a

model, labeling them as either a picture of a cat, or not a cat. The model will look for the various asPEcts
of each image and determine the scores and weights that are most common within a " cat " image. This
may be an image with whiskers (although mice have whiskers too) or one with pointy ears (although the
ears of a fox are also pointy), but a combination of all these factors may lead the model to effectively
recognize cats in future images.
The SECond AI phase is inference, where the AI model makes a decision on an image, based on its prior
training. In the cat example, the user would feed an unlabeled image into the model, and the model
provides an output of whether it recognizes a cat or not.
Similar techniques are used in large language models associated with generative AI. In these cases,
LLMs are fed with massive amounts of data, which may come from the internet, research paPErs,
databases, and so on Based on this data, the LLM determines scores and weights associated with
language, and which words are associated with one another.
As an overly simple example, a model might be asked to predict the word to come after " PEanut butter
and ..." " Jelly " might be the next word when thinking about food categories, although " PEanuts, "
" honey, " or other foods could be matches. But if the model were to think of categories outside of food,
words like " diet, " " allergies, " or others could be fit. This leads to scores (that is, how often is " jelly " the
next food word, versus " honey, " and so on), but also the weighting of such dimensions (that is, how
often is the next word a food word, versus a health word, versus a geographic location, versus many
other tyPEs of categories).
GPUs are best suited to make these many billions of calculations needed for LLMs to predict the next
word in a query (GPT-3 was trained on 175 billion parameters, for example). More important, Nvidia
made shrewd moves to build and expand the Cuda software platform, creating and hosting a variety of
libraries, compilers, frameworks, and development tools that allowed AI professionals to build their
models. Cuda is proprietary to Nvidia and only runs on Nvidia GPUs, and we believe this hardware plus
software integration has created high customer switching costs in AI that contribute to Nvidia's wide
moat.
Even if a chip comPEtitor were to build a GPU on par with Nvidia, we surmise that the code and models
built on Cuda to date would not be ported over to another GPU, giving Nvidia an incumbency
advantage. It is conceivable that alternatives may emerge that might never touch Cuda or an Nvidia
GPU, but Nvidia had virtually no comPEtition in this arena when everyone was focused on AI in 2022
and 2023, so any enterprise building an LLM but waiting for alternatives would have been left in the
dust.
In AI inference, we believe that a variety of chip solutions will be used over time to detect the patterns

and provide the output associated with AI models. CPUs handle many inference workloads today, but
GPUs will likely be part of the inference equation too. Meta Platforms even indicated that it is moving its
inference workloads to GPUs rather than CPUs. In a bullish scenario for GPU vendors, it's possible that
GPUs might not only dominate AI training, but the vast majority of AI inference too.
Beyond Nvidia's AI prowess today, which we believe is exceptionally strong, we think the company is
making the proPEr moves to widen its moat even further. Nvidia's software efforts with Cuda remain
impressive, while Nvidia is also expanding into networking solutions, most notably with its acquisition of
Mellanox. We don't want to discount Nvidia's know-how here either. Many AI models don't run on solo
GPUs, but rather a connected system of many GPUs running in tandem. Nvidia's proprietary NVLink
products do a good job of connecting Nvidia GPUs together to run these larger models.
Nvidia is eLBOwing out even further with its DGX solutions, priced at well over six figures, which tie in up
to 8 GPUs into integrated solutions. Nvidia is even offering DGX Cloud and has hyPErscaler partners
where Nvidia will run a portion of the customer's data center to optimize AI workloads. In a best-case
scenario, Nvidia might not only have the best GPUs on the market, but the best cloud infrastructure in
AI, potentially becoming a cloud computing leader that enterprises might cherish even more than the
world's leading hyPErscalers today, such as Amazon's AWS or Microsoft's Azure.
Looking at the comPEtitive landscaPE, AMD is a well-capitalized chipmaker with GPU exPErtise,
although we view the company as being in a position of weakness on the software front. Here, we think
switching costs around Cuda will keep Nvidia ahead of AMD for the foreseeable future, although the
key valuation question for both companies centers around how much business AMD can chip away
from Nvidia in the years ahead.
PErhaps the biggest threat might be from in-house chip solutions from hyPErscalers, such as Google's
tensor processing units, or TPUs, Amazon's Trainium and Inferentia chips, or Microsoft's and Meta
Platform's chips in development. There's no guarantee that any of these chips will be suPErior to
Nvidia's GPUs across a wide range of applications, but it's likely that each of these in-house chips might
PErform sPEcific workloads better than a general AI GPU from Nvidia or others.
However, we believe that cloud computing companies will have to offer their enterprise customers a full
menu of GPUs and accelerators so that they can run AI workloads. Amazon and Google may use
Trainium and TPUs to train their own AI models, resPEctively, but we think they may struggle to
encourage a host of enterprise customers to optimize their AI models for these in-house semis. Doing so
would prevent these enterprise customers from switching among cloud providers, and enterprises
typically loathe to be locked into a single vendor. Thus, neutral merchant GPU vendors will likely be
demanded by enterprise customers, and again, we foresee Nvidia remaining at the head of the pack for
quite some time.

Fair Value and Profit Drivers Brian Colello, CPA, Strategist, 20 Nov 2024
Our fair value estimate is $130 PEr share. This fair value estimate implies an equity value of roughly $3.2
trillion. Our fair value estimate implies a fiscal 2025 (ending January 2025, or effectively calendar 2024)
price/adjusted earnings multiple of 44 times and a fiscal 2026 forward price/adjusted earnings multiple
of 30 times.
Our fair value estimate, and Nvidia ' s stock price, will be driven by its prosPEcts in the data center, or DC,
and AI GPUs, for better or worse. Nvidia ' s DC business has achieved exponential growth already, rising
from $3 billion in fiscal 2020 to $15 billion in fiscal 2023 and more than tripling thereafter to $47.5 billion
in fiscal 2024. DC revenue remains supply-constrained and near-term revenue will rise as more supply
comes online. Based on Nvidia ' s strong results in fiscal 2025 to date, we model DC revenue rising 141%
to $114 billion in fiscal 2025. We model 55% growth in fiscal 2026 to $177 billion, 20% growth to $213
billion in fiscal 2027, and 13% growth to $240 billion in fiscal 2028, resulting in a 23% CAGR for the
three years thereafter. The main driver of this growth is an ongoing increase in capital exPEnditures in
data centers at leading enterprise and cloud computing customers. We think it is reasonable that Nvidia
may face an inventory correction or a pause in AI demand at some point in the medium term thereafter,
so we model only 5% growth in fiscal 2029. Excluding this one-year blip that we model, we anticipate
average annual DC growth of 10% thereafter and consider this to be a reasonable long-term growth rate
as AI matures. Essentially, we think that cloud computing revenue at the hyPErscalers can grow at a
low-teens rate, caPEx as a PErcentage of revenue remains at consistent levels at these hyPErscalers,
and thus we model Nvidia ' s revenue growth to be on par with these cloud computing growth rates.
In gaming, which was formerly Nvidia ' s largest business, we model $12.0 billion of revenue in fiscal
2025. We susPEct that Nvidia may introduce a PC CPU in the next couple of years, but once this chip
comes to market, we model 10% average annual revenue growth in gaming thereafter, bringing the
total business to $21 billion in fiscal 2029.
We have high hoPEs for Nvidia ' s automotive business as greater processing power will be required in
active safety systems and autonomous driving. We model $1.6 billion of revenue in fiscal 2025 and
revenue growing at a 20% CAGR over the next decade.
In summation, Nvidia achieved 126% revenue growth in fiscal 2024, and we anticipate another massive
year with 114% growth to $130 billion in fiscal 2025. We model average annual growth of 12% PEr year
for the nine years thereafter, resulting in a 31% CAGR over the next decade.
Nvidia ' s massive DC growth has been gross margin-accretive, as GAAP gross margin expanded from
57% in fiscal 2023 to 73% in fiscal 2024. We model near-term GAAP gross margin rising to 75% in fiscal
2025 and compressing modestly to the low-70% range in the long-run.

We anticipate that revenue will grow faster than oPErating exPEnses, leading to oPErating leverage.
Nvidia earned a 54% GAAP oPErating margin in fiscal 2024 and we model expansion to 62% in fiscal
2025 and 63% each year from fiscal 2026 to fiscal 2028. We model modest compression thereafter to
the low-60% range thereafter. We exPEct increased comPEtition that may strive to chip away at Nvidia ' s
significant pricing power, but we ultimately exPEct Nvidia to be able to fend off these comPEtitive
pressures, thanks to the high switching costs associated with the Cuda platform.
Risk and Uncertainty Brian Colello, CPA, Strategist, 20 Nov 2024
We assign Nvidia with a Morningstar Uncertainty Rating of Very High. In our view, Nvidia ' s valuation
will be tied to its ability to grow within the data center and AI SECtors, for better or worse. Nvidia is an
industry leader in GPUs used in AI model training, while carving out a good portion of demand for chips
used in AI inference workloads (which involves running a model to make a prediction or output).
We see a host of tech leaders vying for Nvidia ' s leading AI position. We think it is inevitable that leading
hyPErscale vendors, such as Amazon ' s AWS, Microsoft, Google, and Meta Platforms will seek to reduce
their reliance on Nvidia and diversiFY their semiconductor and software supplier base, including the
development of in-house solutions. Google ' s TPUs and Amazon ' s Trainium and Inferentia chips were
designed with AI workloads in mind, while Microsoft and Meta have announced semiconductor design
plans. Among existing semis vendors, AMD is quickly expanding its GPU lineup to serve these cloud
leaders. Intel also has AI accelerator products today and will likely remain focused on this opportunity.
Our uncertainty rating is based on the uncertainty around this market. Nvidia dominates AI today and
the sky is the limit for the company ' s profitability if it can maintain this lead over the next decade.
However, any semblance of the successful development of alternatives could meaningfully limit Nvidia ' s
upside.
Outside of the data center, Nvidia ' s gaming business often faces boom-or-bust cycles along with PC
demand and, more recently, the sharp rise and fall of cryptocurrency mining. Nvidia also has invested
heavily in autonomous driving but again squares off against many other chipmakers (and automakers)
for a piece of this pie with little guarantee of success.
Capital Allocation Brian Colello, CPA, Strategist, 20 Nov 2024
We assign Nvidia an Exemplary Capital Allocation Rating, which reflects our assessment of a sound
balance sheet, exceptional investments associated with the firm ' s strategy and execution, and attractive

requirements, potential acquisitions, and shareholder returns.
We remain impressed with Nvidia ' s prescient investments in GPUs, networking semis, and software, as
the company sPEnt the past decade (if not longer) laying the groundwork to emerge as the clear leader
in AI training GPUs and associated software and tools. Like many chipmakers, Nvidia ' s hefty R&D
budget enabled the company to remain on the cutting edge of GPU design. Partnerships with Samsung
and, increasingly, Taiwan Semi have enabled the company to release best-of-breed GPUs used in PC
gaming. Yet the more impressive investments, in our view, was the less heralded work to develop the
Cuda software platform, which includes the libraries, compilers, and development tools needed for
engineers to deploy Nvidia ' s GPUs in the data center for AI workloads. We now believe that Nvidia
benefits from hefty switching costs in the data center. Even if AMD or another comPEtitor could build a
semiconductor that is comparable with Nvidia ' s data center GPUs (such as the HopPEr H100), we
surmise that AI develoPErs will stick with Nvidia because such AI models were built with Cuda.
On the M&A front, the deal that stands out is Nvidia ' s acquisition Mellanox Technologies for $6.9 billion
in early 2020. Mellanox sells networking products that focus on efficient data transfer in data centers
via its InfiniBand and Ethernet technologies for interconnects. Nvidia is reliant on these technologies inhouse as well, using InfiniBand to build powerful DGX integrated systems used for the heftiest of AI
workloads.
In September 2020, Nvidia attempted to acquire ARM Holdings from the SoftBank Group in a
transaction valued at $40 billion. Nvidia ' s hoPE was to steer ARM toward the development of data
center products while incorporating Nvidia ' s AI exPErtise. The deal immediately faced pushback from
ARM ' s licensee customers and regulatory challenges and was terminated in February 2022. We don ' t
think the failed merger was a dealbreaker for Nvidia, as the company continues to license IP from ARM
and has recently launched its " Grace " line of ARM-based CPUs for the data center.
Management initiated a quarterly dividend in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 to return excess cash to
shareholders, but the payout is rather immaterial today. Most of Nvidia ' s distributions to shareholders
come in the form of share repurchases.

Nvidia Earnings: Maintaining $105 Fair Value as We See No Signs of an AI Slowdown Brian Colello,
CPA, Strategist, 29 Aug 2024
Wide-moat Nvidia continues to fire on all cylinders as the firm reported fiscal SECond-quarter results and
a third-quarter forecast that were ahead of our prior exPEctations and FactSet consensus estimates. Our
confidence in Nvidia remains, as the company is still prosPEring from insatiable demand for graphics
processors, or GPU, and related products used in data centers to run artificial intelligence. However,

Nvidia ' s earnings beat wasn ' t as eye-poPPIng as in quarters past, which may explain why shares fell
after hours.
We maintain our $105 PEr share fair value estimate. In the near term, we still assume that Nvidia will
increase its data center, or DC, revenue by a few billion PEr quarter as additional GPU production
capacity comes online. Yet our fair value estimate is mostly driven by our longer-term assumptions for AI
adoption and robust DC sPEnding by Nvidia ' s key AI customers. We maintain our Very High Morningstar
Uncertainty Rating as both assumptions will be opaque and may shift in the years ahead.
Revenue in the July quarter was $30 billion, up 15% sequentially, up 122% year over year, and ahead of
guidance of $28 billion. DC revenue was $26.3 billion, up 154% year over year. Even with Nvidia ' s nextgeneration Blackwell products arriving later this year, the firm saw no slowdown in demand for its
existing HopPEr family of products. Nvidia exPEcts to earn " several billions " of Blackwell revenue in its
fiscal fourth quarter ending January 2025. In the meantime, management anticipates that HopPEr
shipments and revenue will still see growth in the SECond half of fiscal 2025, as customers won ' t pause
their purchases of HopPEr while waiting for Blackwell.
Nvidia exPEcts October-quarter revenue to be $32.5 billion, which would be up 8% sequentially and 79%
year over year. Nvidia ' s key AI customers still intend to invest heavily in AI capital exPEnditure, and we
still exPEct Nvidia to reap most of the rewards of such sPEnding.
Nvidia Earnings: Raising Fair Value to $1,050 From $910 as AI Demand Still Exceeds ExPEctations
Brian Colello, CPA, Strategist, 23 May 2024
Wide-moat Nvidia once again reported stellar quarterly results and provided investors with even rosier
exPEctations for the upcoming quarter, as the company remains the clear winner in the race to build out
generative artificial intelligence capabilities. We ' re encouraged by management ' s commentary that
demand for its upcoming Blackwell products should exceed supply into calendar 2025, and we see no
signs of AI demand slowing either.
We raise our fair value estimate to $1,050 from $910 as we model stronger data center revenue growth
over the next several quarters while maintaining our longer-term growth rates from a higher installed
base of AI equipment. Shares were up about 6% on the earnings report, and we think the reaction is
justified and view shares as fairly valued.
Revenue in the April quarter was $26.0 billion, up 18% sequentially as more supply for Nvidia ' s graphics
processing units came online. Revenue was up 262% year over year and ahead of guidance of $24.0
billion. Data center revenue remains the focus, coming in at $22.6 billion (87% of total revenue), up 23%
sequentially and 427% year over year. Demand continues from cloud computing leaders as they support
their customers in building AI models, as well as from enterprises, consumer internet leaders like Meta
Platforms, and sovereign governments building AI into telecom and other services. Nvidia still wields

exceptional pricing power, with an adjusted gross margin of up 220 basis points sequentially to 78.9%,
ahead of guidance of 77%.
Nvidia exPEcts July-quarter revenue to be $28.0 billion, up 8% sequentially and 107% year over year,
and ahead of FactSet consensus estimates of $26.6 billion. We anticipate Nvidia will once again beat
these estimates, and we model $29.7 billion of revenue. The firm has earned at least $3 billion of
incremental data center revenue in each of the past three quarters, driven by AI demand, and we
anticipate that a fourth similar quarter is on the near-term horizon.
Nvidia: Blackwell Platform, Higher CaPEx Should Drive Growth; Raising Fair Value by 25% to $910
Brian Colello, CPA, Strategist, 19 Mar 2024
Nvidia ' s GTC conference keynote address introduced the company ' s latest artificial intelligence graphics
processor, or AI GPU, Blackwell, along with its associated platform and GPU clusters to enable AI
workloads. Just as important, GTC showcased the efforts of the company ' s wide range of partners in
areas such as robotics and automotive, among many others. We don ' t foresee these partners slowing
their investments anytime soon, which supports our healthy growth estimates for Nvidia in the years
ahead.
We raise our fair value estimate for wide-moat Nvidia to $910 PEr share from $730, as we ' ve taken a
fresh look at our model assumptions and we ' re more optimistic about future industrywide capital
exPEnditure, or caPEx, on AI GPUs in the decade ahead, both from large cloud computing vendors (that
is, hyPErscalers) and enterprises. HyPErscaler caPEx should be meaningfully higher in 2024, with Nvidia
receiving a windfall from such sPEnding, and we now anticipate even higher industrywide data center
caPEx as more and more businesses invest in AI. We reiterate our Very High Morningstar Uncertainty
Rating as we concede that these caPEx plans, AI workloads, and comPEtitive dynamics are changing
rapidly. We now view Nvidia ' s shares as fairly valued.
Nvidia launched a barrage of news and partnerships at GTC -- we count 42 press releases and/or blog
posts on its website -- but we think the larger trend is that a wide variety of businesses are reliant on
Nvidia ' s AI GPU computing power, with Blackwell extending the company ' s lead. In turn, we think
hyPErscalers will continue to increase their total caPEx levels and disproportionately tilt their caPEx
sPEnding toward Nvidia ' s AI GPUs. These hyPErscalers have the fortress balance sheets to support
these investments in the years ahead and should reap the rewards of higher cloud computing revenue
and earnings as these GPUs are deployed. We anticipate that enterprises will mIRRor higher caPEx as
well.

Wide-moat Nvidia reported another quarter of outstanding revenue and earnings while providing
investors with a forecast for the April quarter that was well ahead of our exPEctations. Leading cloud
computing companies plan to boost their capital exPEnditures to satisFY demand for artificial intelligence
training and inference, and it apPEars that virtually all this sPEnding will fall into Nvidia ' s pockets. More
importantly, we anticipate healthy growth for Nvidia ' s data center revenue beyond 2024, as Nvidia ' s
Cuda software should contribute to strong customer stickiness for existing AI models and workloads.
We raise our fair value estimate for Nvidia to $730 from $480 as we boost our near-term and long-term
revenue and profitability assumptions, thanks to the tremendous rise in AI computing demand. We
reiterate our Very High Uncertainty Rating, as the comPEtitive landscaPE in AI seems to be changing
almost weekly.
Nvidia ' s total revenue in the January quarter was $22.1 billion, up 22% sequentially, up 265% year over
year, and ahead of guidance of $20 billion. Data center remains the only segment that should matter to
investors. DC revenue of $18.4 billion was up 27% sequentially as more graphics processor packaging
supply came online and was up 409% year over year and exceeded the $15.0 billion Nvidia earned in
the DC segment all of last year.
We think fiscal 2025 will be a banner year for Nvidia as demand continues to exceed supply. In the April
quarter, Nvidia forecasts total revenue of $24 billion, which implies over $21 billion of DC revenue,
which would again be five times greater than the year-ago quarter. This revenue should again be
virtually all profit for Nvidia, as the company forecasts a 76% GAAP gross margin, and we model a 63%
GAAP oPErating margin. We anticipate revenue will rise by a couple of billion each quarter throughout
fiscal 2025 for Nvidia as more chip supply comes online.
Nvidia: We' re Pleased With the Innovation Discussed by Nvidia at CES 2024; Shares Fairly Valued
Brian Colello, CPA, Strategist, 12 Jan 2024
We met with Nvidia's management team at CES 2024 in Las Vegas and came away from the investoronly event with modestly more confidence in our existing assumptions that the company will deliver
another year of exceptional data center revenue growth in fiscal 2025, which is effectively calendar
2024. We maintain our $480 fair value estimate for wide-moat Nvidia, and shares apPEar modestly
overvalued after a recent runup in share price. We also maintain our Very High fair value uncertainty
rating as Nvidia's valuation will remain closely tied to the rapidly evolving artificial intelligence market in
the years to come.
On the data center front, Nvidia foresees high ongoing demand for artificial intelligence accelerators
such as graphics processing units, or GPUs, in data centers, particularly at leading cloud vendors.
Management believes it has good visibility into the capital exPEnditure plans of these cloud vendors and
that Nvidia's GPUs will continue to receive a high proportion of such sPEnding in the near term. GPU

supply is also still improving at key foundry and packaging partners, and we still doubt that such
investments would be made if there was any indication that Nvidia's recent GPU revenue was leading to
excess capacity in the market.
Management was also optimistic about the evolution of the PC and how artificial intelligence will
change how PCs are built, used, and purchased. The company toned down the hyPE by suggesting that
a lot of noise around AI will be in the PC market in 2024, but in the medium term, new apps and
improved PC applications will come to market. Improved gaming and interactive entertainment will be
fIRSt, but enterprise applications like content creation and video conferencing will be infused with AI too.
AI might be an important selling point when the big rush in PC upgrades in 2020 are up for a refresh
(say, in 2025), and Nvidia is well positioned with CPU and GPU exPErtise to potentially participate.
Nvidia Earnings: Maintaining our $480 Fair Value Estimate as It Remains the King of AI Processors
Brian Colello, CPA, Strategist, 22 Nov 2023
Wide-moat Nvidia reported predictably outstanding results for the October quarter that were ahead of
guidance, while the company ' s fiscal fourth quarter outlook was also ahead of our prior exPEctations.
Nvidia is clearly the dominant provider of graphics processing units deployed in data centers, and we
don ' t foresee the company losing its supremacy any time soon. We maintain our $480 fair value
estimate and view shares as fairly valued. We also maintain our Very High Uncertainty Rating, as the
timing and magnitude of future artificial intelligence GPU growth remains unclear to us, esPEcially given
recent U.S. restrictions on chip sales into China. That said, Nvidia ' s earnings report gives us a small
confidence boost that the firm can reach our projection of $100 billion of data center revenue in fiscal
2028, as compared with just $15 billion last fiscal year and our estimate of $46 billion this year.
Revenue in the October quarter was $18.1 billion, up 34% sequentially, up 206% year over year, and
above guidance and our estimate of $16.0 billion. Data center revenue, driven by insatiable AI GPU
demand, remains the only story that matters, in our view, with revenue of $14.5 billion up 41%
sequentially and 279% year over year. AI GPU demand is coming from all customer tyPEs -- cloud,
consumer internet firms, and enterprises. Nvidia ' s hefty pricing power on its GPUs remains intact, as
adjusted gross margin rose to 75% and adjusted oPErating margin came in at 64%, above guidance of
72.5% and 53%, resPEctively.
Nvidia exPEcts revenue in the January quarter of $20 billion, which would be up 10% sequentially and
230% year over year. Within revenue, we estimate that data center revenue will be $16.8 billion, up a
whoPPIng 366% year over year. A significant decline in revenue from China will be offset by robust
growth elsewhere in the world. Adjusted gross margin is forecast to be 75.5%, and we model an
exceptional 65% adjusted oPErating margin next quarter. K

Research Methodology for Valuing Companies
Overview
At the heart of our valuation system is a detailed projection of a company's future cash flows, resulting from our
analysts' research. Analysts create custom industry and
company assumptions to feed income statement, balance
sheet, and capital investment assumptions into our globally standardized, proprietary discounted cash flow, or
DCF, modeling templates. We use scenario analysis, indepth comPEtitive advantage analysis, and a variety of other
analytical tools to augment this process. Moreover, we
think analyzing valuation through discounted cash flows
presents a better lens for viewing cyclical companies,
high-growth firms, businesses with finite lives (e.g.,
mines), or companies exPEcted to generate negative
earnings over the next few years. That said, we don't dismiss multiples altogether but rather use them as supporting cross-checks for our DCF-based fair value estimates.
We also acknowledge that DCF models offer their own
challenges (including a potential proliferation of estimated inputs and the possibility that the method may miss
shortterm market-price movements), but we believe these
negatives are mitigated by deep analysis and our
longterm appROAch.
Morningstar's equity research group ("we," "our") believes that a company's intrinsic worth results from the
future cash flows it can generate. The Morningstar Rating
for stocks identifies stocks trading at a discount or premium to their intrinsic worth--or fair value estimate, in
Morningstar terminology. Five-star stocks sell for the
biggest risk adjusted discount to their fair values, whereas 1-star stocks trade at premiums to their intrinsic worth.
Four key components drive the Morningstar rating: (1) our
assessment of the firm's economic moat, (2) our estimate
of the stock's fair value, (3) our uncertainty around that
fair value estimate and (4) the current market price. This
process ultimately culminates in our singlepoint star rating.
turns on invested capital (or ROIC) over and above our estimate of a firm's cost of capital, or weighted average
cost of capital (or WACC). Without a moat, profits are
more susceptible to comPEtition. We have identified five
sources of economic moats: intangible assets, switching
costs, network effect, cost advantage, and efficient scale.
Companies with a narrow moat are those we believe are
more likely than not to achieve normalized excess returns
for at least the next 10 years. Wide-moat companies are
those in which we have very high confidence that excess
returns will remain for 10 years, with excess returns more
likely than not to remain for at least 20 years. The longer
a firm generates economic profits, the higher its intrinsic
value. We believe low-quality, no-moat companies will
see their normalized returns gravitate toward the firm ' s
cost of capital more quickly than companies with moats.
When considering a company's moat, we also assess
whether there is a substantial threat of value destruction,
stemming from risks related to ESG, industry disruption,
financial health, or other idiosyncratic issues. In this context, a risk is considered potentially value destructive if its
occurrence would eliminate a firm ' s economic profit on a
cumulative or midcycle basis. If we deem the probability
of occurrence sufficiently high, we would not characterize
the company as possessing an economic moat.
2. Estimated Fair Value
Combining our analysts ' financial forecasts with the
firm ' s economic moat helps us assess how long returns
on invested capital are likely to exceed the firm ' s cost of
capital. Returns of firms with a wide economic moat rating are assumed to fade to the PErPEtuity PEriod over a
longer PEriod of time than the returns of narrow-moat
firms, and both will fade slower than no-moat firms, increasing our estimate of their intrinsic value.
Our model is divided into three distinct stages:
1. Economic Moat
Stage I: Explicit Forecast
The concept of an economic moat plays a vital role not
only in our qualitative assessment of a firm's long-term
investment potential, but also in the actual calculation of
our fair value estimates. An economic moat is a structural
feature that allows a firm to sustain excess profits over a
long PEriod of time. We define economic profits as reIn this stage, which can last five to 10 years, analysts
make full financial statement forecasts, including items
such as revenue, profit margins, tax rates, changes in
workingcapital accounts, and capital sPEnding. Based on
these projections, we calculate earnings before interest,
after taxes (EBI) and the net new investment (NNI) to deMorningstar Equity Research Star Rating Methodology
rive our annual free cash flow forecast.
Stage II: Fade
The SECond stage of our model is the PEriod it will take
the company ' s return on new invested capital -- the return on capital of the next dollar invested ( " RONIC " ) -- to
decline (or rise) to its cost of capital. During the Stage II
PEriod, we use a formula to approximate cash flows in
lieu of explicitly modeling the income statement, balance
sheet, and cash flow statement as we do in Stage I. The
length of the SECond stage dePEnds on the strength of
the company ' s economic moat. We forecast this PEriod to
last anywhere from one year (for companies with no economic moat) to 10 - 15 years or more (for wide-moat companies). During this PEriod, cash flows are forecast using
four assumptions: an average growth rate for EBI over the
PEriod, a normalized investment rate, average return on
new invested capital (RONIC), and the number of years
until PErPEtuity, when excess returns cease. The investment rate and return on new invested capital decline until a PErPEtuity value is calculated. In the case of firms
that do not earn their cost of capital, we assume marginal
ROICs rise to the firm ' s cost of capital (usually attributable to less reinvestment), and we may truncate the
SECond stage.
Stage III: PErPEtuity
Once a company ' s marginal ROIC hits its cost of capital,
we calculate a continuing value, using a standard PErPEtuity formula. At PErPEtuity, we assume that any
growth or decline or investment in the business neither
creates nor destroys value and that any new investment
provides a return in line with estimated WACC.
Because a dollar earned today is worth more than a dollar
earned tomorrow, we discount our projections of cash
flows in stages I, II, and III to arrive at a total present
value of exPEcted future cash flows. Because we are
modeling free cash flow to the firm -- representing cash
available to provide a return to all capital providers -- we
discount future cash flows using the WACC, which is a
weighted average of the costs of equity, debt, and preferred stock (and any other funding sources), using exPEcted future proportionate long-term, market-value
weights.
3. Uncertainty Around That Fair Value Estimate
Morningstar ' s Uncertainty Rating is designed to capture
the range of potential outcomes for a company ' s intrinsic
value. This rating is used to assign the margin of safety
required before investing, which in turn explicitly drives
our stock star rating system. The Uncertainty Rating is
aimed at identiFYing the confidence we should have in assigning a fair value estimate for a given stock.
Our Uncertainty Rating is meant to take into account anything that can increase the potential disPErsion of future
outcomes for the intrinsic value of a company, and any-

Research Methodology for Valuing Companies
thing that can affect our ability to accurately predict
these outcomes. The rating begins with a suggested rating produced by a quantitative process based on the trailing 12-month standard deviation of daily stock returns.
An analyst overlay is then applied, with analysts using
the suggested rating, historical rating data, and their own
knowledge of the company to inform them as they make
the final Uncertainty Rating decision. Ultimately, the rating decision rests with the analyst. Analysts take into account many characteristics when making their final decision, including cyclical factors, oPErational and financial
factors such as leverage, company-sPEcific events, ESG
risks, and anything else that might increase the potential
disPErsion of future outcomes and our ability to estimate
those outcomes.
Our recommended margin of safety--the discount to fair
value demanded before we'd recommend buying or
selling the stock--widens as our uncertainty of the estimated value of the equity increases. The more uncertain
we are about the potential disPErsion of outcomes, the
greater the discount we require relative to our estimate of
the value of the firm before we would recommend the
purchase of the shares. In addition, the Uncertainty Rating provides guidance in portfolio construction based on
risk tolerance.
Our Uncertainty Ratings are: Low, Medium, High, Very
High, and Extreme.

Our uncertainty rating is based on the interquartile range,
or the middle 50% of potential outcomes, covering the
25th PErcentile-75th PErcentile. This means that when a
stock hits 5 stars, we exPEct there is a 75% chance that
the intrinsic value of that stock lies above the current
market price. Similarly, when a stock hits 1 star, we exPEct there is a 75% chance that the intrinsic value of that
stock lies below the current market price.

Morningstar Star Rating for Stocks
Morningstar Equity Research Star Rating Methodology
Once we determine the fair value estimate of a stock, we
compare it with the stock ' s current market price on a
daily basis, and the star rating is automatically re-calculated at the market close on every day the market on
which the stock is listed is oPEn. Our analysts keep close
tABS on the companies they follow, and, based on thorough and ongoing analysis, raise or lower their fair value
estimates as warranted.
justed return is highly likely over a multiyear time frame.
Scenario analysis develoPEd by our analysts indicates
that the current market price represents an excessively
PEssimistic outlook, limiting downside risk and maximizing upside potential.
QQQQ We believe appreciation beyond a fair risk-adjusted return is likely.
Please note, there is no predefined distribution of stars.
That is, the PErcentage of stocks that earn 5 stars can
fluctuate daily, so the star ratings, in the aggregate, can
serve as a gauge of the bROAder market ' s valuation. When
there are many 5-star stocks, the stock market as a whole
is more undervalued, in our opinion, than when very few
companies garner our highest rating.
We exPEct that if our base-case assumptions are true the
market price will converge on our fair value estimate over
time generally within three years (although it is impossible to predict the exact time frame in which market
prices may adjust).
Our star ratings are guideposts to a bROAd audience and
individuals must consider their own sPEcific investment
goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, time horizon, income
needs, and complete investment portfolio, among other
factors.
The Morningstar Star Ratings for stocks are defined below:
QQQQQ We believe appreciation beyond a fair risk adQQQ Indicates our belief that investors are likely to receive a fair risk-adjusted return (approximately cost of
equity).
QQ We believe investors are likely to receive a less than
fair risk-adjusted return.
Q Indicates a high probability of undesirable risk-adjusted returns from the current market price over a multiyear
time frame, based on our analysis. Scenario analysis by
our analysts indicates that the market is pricing in an excessively optimistic outlook, limiting upside potential and
leaving the investor exposed to Capital loss.

starting at zero (no risk) with lower scores representing
less unmanaged risk and, for 95% of cases, the unmanaged ESG Risk score is below 50.
Based on their quantitative scores, companies are
grouPEd into one of five Risk Categories (negligible, low,
medium, high, severe). These risk categories are ABSolute,
meaning that a ' high risk ' assessment reflects a comparable degree of unmanaged ESG risk across all subindustries covered.
The ESG Risk Rating Assessment is a visual representation of Sustainalytics ESG Risk Categories on a 1 to 5
scale. Companies with Negligible Risk = 5 Globes, Low
Risk = 4, Medium Risk = 3 Globes, High Risk = 2 Globes,
Severe Risk = 1 Globe. For more information, please visit

Ratings should not be used as the sole basis in evaluating
a company or SECurity. Ratings involve unknown risks and
uncertainties which may cause our exPEctations not to
occur or to differ significantly from what was exPEcted
and should not be considered an offer or solicitation to
buy or sell a SECurity.
Risk Warning
Please note that investments in SECurities are subject to
market and other risks and there is no assurance or guarantee that the intended investment objectives will be
achieved. Past PErformance of a SECurity may or may not
be sustained in future and is no indication of future PErformance. A SECurity investment return and an investor ' s
principal value will fluctuate so that, when redeemed, an
investor ' s shares may be worth more or less than their
original cost. A SECurity ' s current investment PErformance
may be lower or higher than the investment PErformance
noted within the report. Morningstar ' s Uncertainty Rating
serves as a useful data point with resPEct to sensitivity
analysis of the assumptions used in our determining a fair
value price.
