Trade Tensions: U.S.-China Tariffs and Retaliatory Measures
On February 4, the U.S. implemented an additional 10% tariff on all Chinese imports. In response, China announced a combination of countermeasures, including:
* New tariffs on U.S. goods
* Export restrictions on critical minerals
* Blacklist expansion for U.S. companies
* Antitrust investigations targeting foreign entities
Comparative Impact of Tariffs
* China imposed an additional 12% tariff on $14 billion of U.S. goods
* The U.S. imposed an additional 10% tariff on $525 billion of Chinese goods
* Bottom Line: While China’s tariff response is less aggressive in absolute monetary terms, the combination of non-tariff barriers suggests a coordinated and strategic policy approach.
