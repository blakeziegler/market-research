4. Normal Distribution The normal distribution is the most extensively used probability distribution in quantitative work. A normal distribution is symmetrical and bell-shaped as shown in the graph below: In this figure ‘m’ stands for mean, 1s means one standard deviation, 2s means two standard deviations, and so on. We can make the following probability statements for a normal distribution: Approximately 68% of all observations fall in the interval m ± 1s. Approximately 95% of all observations fall in the interval m ± 2s. Approximately 99% of all observations fall in the interval m ± 3s. The intervals indicated above are easy to remember but are only approximate for the stated probabilities. More precise intervals (confidence intervals) are: 90% of all observations are in the interval m ± 1.65s. 95% of all observations are in the interval m ± 1.96s. 99% of all observations are in the interval m ± 2.58s. The characteristics of a normal distribution are as follows: The normal distribution is completely described by two parameters – its mean, µ, and variance, σ2. We indicate this as X ~ N (µ, σ 2). The normal distribution has a skewness of 0 (it is symmetric) and a kurtosis (measure of peakedness) of 3. Due to the symmetry, the mean, median and mode are all equal for a normal random variable. A linear combination of two or more normal random variables is also normally distributed.

Standard normal distribution The normal distribution with mean (µ) = 0 and standard deviation (σ) = 1 is called the standard normal distribution. The formula for standardizing a random variable X is: where: µ is the population mean. σ is the population standard deviation. The Z-table is used to find the probability that X will be less than or equal to a given value. Suppose we have a normal random variable, X, with µ = 10 and σ = 2. If the value of X is 11, we standardize X with Z = (11 – 10)/2 = 0.5. The probability that we will observe a value less than 11 for X ~ N (10, 2) is exactly the same as the probability that we will observe a value less than 0.5 for Z ~ N (0, 1). We can answer probability questions about X using standardized values and probability tables for Z.

example, locate the row that contains 0.50, look at the 0 column, and find the entry 0.6915. Thus, P(Z ≤ 0.5) = 0.6915 or 69.15%. The probability that a standard normal variable is less than or equal to 0 is 0.5000. This is true by definition because the mean of a standard normal distribution is 0. The table above validates this fact. For a non-negative number x, we can use N(x) directly from the table. For a negative number –x, N(-x) = 1.0 – N(x). Essentially, we are using the fact that the normal distribution is symmetric around the mean.

Example A portfolio has a mean return of 15% and a standard deviation of return of 20% per year. What is the probability that the portfolio return would be below 18%? We are given the following information from the z-table: P(Z < 0.15) = 0.5596, P(Z > 0.15) = 0.4404, P(Z < 0.18) = 0.5714, P(Z > 0.18) = 0.4286.

Solution: P(Z < (X - μ)/σ) = P(Z < (0.18 - 0.15)/0.20) = P(Z < 0.15) = 0.5596

Univariate v/s multivariate distribution Univariate distribution A univariate distribution describes the probability distribution of a single random variable. For example, the distribution of expected return of one stock from a portfolio. Multivariate distribution A multivariate distribution describes the probability distribution for a group of related random variables. For example, the distribution of expected return of a portfolio with multiple stocks. A multivariate normal distribution for the returns on n stocks is completely defined by the following three sets of parameters: Mean returns on the individual stocks (n means in total). Variances of the individual stocks (n variances in total). Pairwise return correlations between the stocks (n (n – 1)/2 distinct correlations in total).
