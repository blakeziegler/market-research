5.1 Overview of Derivative Instruments
A derivative instrument is an instrument that derives its value from and is dePEndent on the value of an underlying
asset. In this module, the word derivative is used interchangeably with derivative instrument and derivative
contract.
5.1.1 TyPEs of Derivative Instruments
There are three main tyPEs of derivative contracts: (1) forward contracts (forwards) and futures contracts (futures),
(2) swap contracts (swaps), and (3) option contracts (options). The following example explains each tyPE of
derivative contract.
Suppose that you work at a gold mining company, and the price of gold has been volatile in the last 12 months.
You anticipate that 300,000 ounces (oz) of gold will be available for sale over the next 12 months. Gold is currently
trading in the market at $950/oz, which is the spot price. You have no way of knowing what the market price of
gold will be in the next 12 months.
Say you want to presell a portion of the gold at a fixed price. You found a wholesaler who is willing to buy 100,000
oz of gold at a price of $1,000/oz in 12 months. That is, the wholesaler is obligated to purchase the gold at the
agreed-on price in 12 months regardless of the prevailing market price. An agreement to transact at a fixed price at
a future point in time is called a forward or a future. The differences between forwards and futures are explained in
SECtion 5.3.
You also found a bank that is willing to buy 8,000 oz of gold each month for the next 12 months at a price of
$1,025/oz. Similarly, the bank is obligated to buy the gold at the agreed-on price. Unlike a single purchase, as in a
forward or future contract, the bank will buy gold in a series of 12 purchases. This contract is called a swap. Swaps
are explained in detail in SECtion 5.4.
At the same time, you found a dealer interested in having the right (but not the obligation) to buy 100,000 oz of
gold at a price of $1,050/oz in 12 months, at the expiration of the option. The option holder may choose not to
exercise the option in 12 months. Their decision is dePEndent on the prevailing market price of gold on the last day
of the contract. This contract is called an option. There are various styles and tyPEs of options, which are explained
in detail in SECtion 5.5.
5.1.2 Characteristics of Derivative Instruments
There are four key terms to all derivative contracts: (1) the underlying, (2) size and exercise price, (3) expiration
date, and (4) settlement.
5.1.2.1 Underlying
Derivatives can be created on any asset, event, or outcome, which is called the underlying. The underlying can be
a real asset such as gold (as was the case in the introductory example) or a financial asset such as a company's
shares. The underlying can be an event such as bankruptcy or default. The underlying can also be the outcome of
a bROAd market index, such as the S&P 500 Index.
5.1.2.2 Size and Exercise Price
The derivative contract (i.e., forward, future, swap, or option contract) must also sPEciFY size and exercise price.
The size is the amount of the underlying to be exchanged. The exercise price is what the underlying will be
purchased or sold for under the contract terms. The exercise price can also be called the strike price. Note that
the exercise price sPEcified in the contract is not the current or spot price for the underlying but a price for future
delivery.
84
05 -- Valuation of Financial Instruments -- Part 2 -- Derivative Instruments
5.1.2.3 Expiration Date
All derivatives have a finite life. Each derivative contract sPEcifies a date on which the contract ends, called the
expiration date.
5.1.2.4 Settlement
Settlement defines how a derivative contract is satisfied at expiration. Some contracts require settlement by
physical delivery of the underlying, and other contracts allow for -- or even require -- cash settlement. Cash
settlement requires less time and cost to deliver on expiry. In practice, most derivatives contracts are settled in
cash.
5.1.3 Benefits and Costs of Holding the Underlying
Some commodities generate a benefit that is somewhat opaque and difficult to measure. This benefit is called the
convenience yield. It represents a non-monetary advantage of holding the asset. Convenience yields are primarily
associated with commodities and generally exist due to either difficulty in shorting1 the commodity or unusually
tight supplies. For example, suppose a commodity cannot be sold short without great difficulty or cost. This
constraint limits the amount of market participants who can trade the commodity in a timely manner. As a result,
a commodity holder has an advantage in selling and extracting a price premium when the demand is rising and the
supply of the commodity falls short. This temporary disequilibrium in supply and demand is uncommon in a wellfunctioning market where shorting is inexPEnsive and supply is abundant (such as financial assets). Convenience
yields tend to exist when the costs associated with physical storage are relatively low.
Holding physical commodities usually requires a cost of storage. One cannot own gold, oil, or wheat without
incurring some cost for storing these assets. There are also costs incurred in protecting and insuring some
commodities against theft or destruction. DePEnding on the commodity, these costs can be quite significant.
The term carry often refers to the net of the costs and benefits. Carry is sometimes known as the cost of carry.
The holding, storing, or carrying of an asset is said to incur a net cost that is essentially what it takes to "carry"
an asset.
One example is when the price of oil futures dropPEd to -$30/barrel (negative) in March 2020. That is, a seller
would need to pay the buyer $30. This example magnifies the cost of carry (where cost exceeded benefit) when
demand for oil dried up due to the pandemic (commodity value was viewed as nil) and the cost of storage
skyrocketed as supply was used up.
For financial assets, convenience yields are either non-existent or extremely limited; the same logic applies to
storage costs, which are generally sufficiently low that they can be ignored in financial analysis.
5.2 Valuation of Derivative Instruments
5.2.1 Valuation AppROAches
Recall from Level I and Level II that there are generally three valuation appROAches: the asset-based, market-based,
and income-based appROAches. This SECtion discusses the consideration for each appROAch in the context of
derivative valuation.
A derivative instrument derives its value from the underlying asset, yet it has no ownership of any asset. As such,
the asset-based appROAch is not applicable for derivative valuation.
A derivative instrument could be valued under the market-based appROAch if a comparable instrument with
identical terms (underlying, size, exercise price, expiration date, and settlement method) can be identified with
1
Shorting means borrowing an asset and agreeing to return it at a later date, while paying an upfront fee to get into the short position.
It is an investment strategy that sPEculates on the decline of the asset price.
85
05 -- Valuation of Financial Instruments -- Part 2 -- Derivative Instruments
active and reliable trading prices. In practice, a market-based appROAch is challenging to apply given the difficulties
in identiFYing PErfectly comparable derivative instruments.
Therefore, an income-based appROAch is most applicable in estimating the fair market value of a derivative
instrument. SECtion 5.2.2 dives into the fundamentals of derivative valuation, followed by applying valuation
methods for each tyPE of derivative instrument in SECtion 5.3, SECtion 5.4, and SECtion 5.5.
5.2.2 Fundamentals of Derivative Valuation
5.2.2.1 Arbitrage and Law of One Price
Arbitrage arises in a situation where two identical assets trade at different prices. Consider the gold example.
Through the graPEvine, you found a seller in Toronto who is willing to sell at $1,000/oz, and you also found a buyer
in Mississauga who is willing to buy at $1,200/oz. The market is opaque, and the two parties are unaware of each
other's bid and ask prices. Given the size of the transaction, assume that the cost of travelling between Toronto
and Mississauga is minimal as you drive an electric car, and the cost of carry is ignorable. You will make $200/oz of
profit if you buy gold from the Toronto seller and sell it to the Mississauga buyer. Sound like free money? Yes, but
it's also too good to be true.
In well-functioning markets with low transaction costs and a free flow of information, traders quickly exploit
arbitrage opportunities when they exist. The combined actions of many traders engaging in the same transaction
of buying the low-priced asset and selling the high-priced asset results in increased demand and an increasing
price for the former and decreased demand and a decreasing price for the latter. This market activity will continue
until the prices converge.
Therefore, identical assets can have only one true market price in theory. This rule is called the law of one
price. With virtually all market participants alert for the possibility of earning such profits at no risk, arbitrage
opportunities are rare.
5.2.2.2 Risk-Neutrality vs. Risk-Aversion Framework
Now let's apply the concept of arbitrage to derivatives. Say you own one ounce of gold -- this is also known as
having a long position on the gold. You want to sell this gold in six months and have found a counterparty willing
to buy at an agreed-on price. You seal the deal with a future contract. This is also known as having a short position
(to sell) on the future, in which the underlying is one ounce of gold. Now you have a PErfect hedge, which has a
long position in the underlying combined with a short position in the derivative.
In a PErfect hedge, all market risks are eliminated. That is, your market risk exposure on the long position is entirely
offset by the short position, and as such, your return is locked in. In this situation, your position should earn a
risk-free rate. That is, the risk-free rate represents the time value of money a PErfect hedge yields, reflecting the
price of giving up your money today in return for receiving more money later. If not, arbitrageurs begin to trade
until the derivative price reaches equilibrium and returns a risk-free rate on the PErfect hedge position. In other
words, the price of the derivative will converge to the law of one price.
This is the fIRSt important assumption in all derivative valuations. That is, there are no arbitrage opportunities for
the derivative, and there is only one price for the derivative that produces a risk-free return for a PErfect hedge
position.
The SECond important assumption is that the valuations for derivatives assume a risk-neutrality framework among
investors. Since the arbitrage mechanism means that any investor is exPEcting a risk-free rate of return on a
PErfect hedge, the discount rate used to discount future payoffs is equivalent to the risk-free rate.
The risk-neutrality assumption in derivative valuations is a significant divergence from debt valuations, which
assume a risk-aversion framework. Under the risk-aversion framework, investors require a risk premium over the
86
05 -- Valuation of Financial Instruments -- Part 2 -- Derivative Instruments
risk-free rate to comPEnsate for the additional credit risk the debt instruments are subject to. Business valuations
also assume a risk-aversion framework, whereby the cost of equity is estimated based on the risk-free rate plus a
risk premium that captures the additional equity risk -- equity risk premium, size premium, and company-sPEcific
risk -- under the CAPM, as discussed in Level II.
5.2.2.3 Intrinsic Value and Time Value
Conceptually, a derivative instrument's value consists of two components: intrinsic value and time value.
Intrinsic value is the value any derivative would have if it was exercised today. Intrinsic value is calculated as the
difference between the spot price and the present value of the exercise price. The present value is calculated by
discounting the exercise price at the risk-free rate under the risk-neutrality framework.
Time value is the value associated with the derivative between the current date and the expiration date. Time
value is calculated as the difference between the derivative value and the intrinsic value. In other words, the time
value represents the price an investor is willing to pay for the upside. Time value is impacted by two factors: the
remaining term to the expiration date and the volatility of the underlying.
Typically, the time value is higher for derivatives with a highly volatile underlying. Time value also declines for all
derivatives as the expiration date appROAches. At expiration, no time value remains, and the derivative is worth
only its intrinsic value.
5.3 Forwards and Futures
5.3.1 Attributes of Forwards and Futures
Forwards and futures involve obligations in the future for both parties to the contract. That is, one party has to
deliver the underlying, and the other has to make full and timely payments. This arrangement is also known as a
bilateral contract.
Bilateral contracts are typically set up such that the two parties' positions are equal at inception. That is, the
terms of the forward or future contract represent the most amount of underlying one party is willing to give up
in exchange for the highest payment the other party is willing to make. Therefore, the contract's net initial value
should be zero. As time goes on and as the market value of the underlying changes, one party would gain at the
other's loss.
Bilateral contracts expose each party to the risk that the other party will not fulfill the contractual agreement,
called counterparty risk.
5.3.2 Differences Between Forwards and Futures
A forward contract is a customized agreement made over the counter between two counterparties that negotiate
and arrive on the contract's exact terms. Prior to delivery and including the time of initiation, no payment is
required on the contract by either party. At settlement, one party will lose and the other party will gain relative to
the spot price of the underlying on the expiration date.
A future contract is a standardized contract with a fixed maturity date and uniform underlying. Futures are traded
on exchanges and are marked-to-market daily, which means that daily changes are settled day by day until the
end of the contract. For clarity, the daily change is calculated as the difference between the current day settlement
price and the previous day settlement price. The daily settlement price is set by the exchange and typically
calculated as the average price of similar contracts traded during the day. The same settlement price applies to all
parties. The presence of an exchange as an intermediary has two advantages: (1) it helps reduce counterparty risk
as each party transacting on the exchange is required to deposit funds as collateral, and (2) it provides liquidity to
investors who can enter and exit whenever they choose.
87
05 -- Valuation of Financial Instruments -- Part 2 -- Derivative Instruments
Despite the settlement differences, it is important to note that the final outcome is the same if a forward and a
future contract with identical terms are held to maturity.
5.3.3 Common TyPEs of Forwards and Futures
There are two main tyPEs of underlying for forwards and futures:
* Financial assets, such as stocks, bonds, market indexes, interest rates, and currencies; and
* Commodities, such as natural gas, gold, copPEr, silver, oil, electricity, coffee beans, and sugar.
5.3.4 Valuation of Forwards and Futures
This SECtion will demonstrate the valuation of a forward contract. All the concepts and formulas discussed below
also apply to future contracts as the fundamentals are the same.
Assume that today, at time 0, a forward contract is created that expires at time T. The value of the underlying
today is S0. At expiration, the underlying value is ST, which is unknown at the contract's inception.
The (forward) exercise price established at the inception date is F0(T). The value at the expiration of the forward
contract is denoted as VT(T) and is stated in Formula 1:
Formula 1: Value of Forward Contract at Given Point in Time
VT(T) = ST - F0(T)
Where:
VT(T) = the value of the forward at expiration
ST = the spot price of the underlying at expiration
F0(T) = the (forward) exercise price established at inception
That is, the value of a forward contract at expiration is the spot price of the underlying minus the (forward)
exercise price agreed to in the contract.
Generally, value is defined as the value to the long position. A long position on the forward contract is the party
paying the exercise price to acquire the underlying.
Looking at the transaction from the point of view of the short party, Formula 1 would need to be adjusted by
multiplying by -1 to calculate the short position, as the short position takes the exact opposite payoff compared to
the long position.
Recall that at the inception of the contract, the initial value is equal to zero. This value is stated in Formula 2:
Formula 2: Value of Forward Contract at Inception
V0(T) = 0
Where:
V0(T) = the value of the forward at inception
Applying the logic in Formula 1, the initial value of the contract is equal to the spot price of the underlying minus
the present value of the (forward) exercise price. This relationship is stated in Formula 3:

05 -- Valuation of Financial Instruments -- Part 2 -- Derivative Instruments
Where:
F0(T) = the (forward) exercise price established at inception
S0 = the spot price of the underlying at inception
r = the risk-free rate at inception
Formula 3 can be rearranged to solve for the (forward) exercise price at inception, as stated in Formula 4.
Formula 4: Value of Forward Contract at Inception (Rearranged)
F0(T) = S0(1 + r)T
Where:
F0(T) = the (forward) exercise price established at inception
S0 = the spot price of the underlying at inception
r = the risk-free rate at inception
That is, the (forward) exercise price is the spot price compounded at the risk-free rate over the life of the contract.
Applying the logic in Formula 1, during the life of the forward, the value of the forward contract equals the spot
price of the underlying minus the present value of the forward price. The relationship is denoted in Formula 5:

r = the risk-free rate at time t
If the asset has a cost of carry, an adjustment can be made, as stated in Formula 6:

The (forward) exercise price denoted as F0(T) is fixed when the contract was initiated; as such, F0(T) remains
unchanged in formulas 1 to 6. The remaining variables need to be updated to reflect the market value at the
measurement or valuation date (time t).
Example 5.1: Valuation of a Forward Contract
At time 0, you entered into a short position to sell 100,000 oz of gold at a (forward) exercise price F0(T) of
$1,000/oz in 12 months (T=12). The spot price of gold (S0) is $950/oz (given).
89
05 -- Valuation of Financial Instruments -- Part 2 -- Derivative Instruments
Six months after inception (t=6), the spot price of gold (St) is $900/oz (given). Assume that the present value of
the benefit (g) is $50/oz (given) and the present value of the cost (th) is $45/oz (given). The risk-free rate (r) at the
time is 5% (given).
The value of the short position of the forward contract can be calculated using Formula 6, as follows:

Conclusion: Your short position in the forward contract is $8,100,000 six months after inception (t=6). It is logical
for the value of the short position to be positive since the price of gold has fallen from T0 ($950/oz) to a price of
$900/oz six months later.
5.4 Swaps
5.4.1 Attributes of Swaps
Swaps are derivative contracts in which two parties exchange (or swap) cash flows and the underlying over
multiple PEriods. Swaps can be thought of as a series of forwards or futures. Swaps involve obligations in the
future for both parties to the contract. As such, swaps are bilateral contracts.
Similar to forwards and futures, a swap contract's initial value should be zero, and as one side of the swap contract
gains, the other side loses by the same amount.
5.4.2 Common TyPEs of Swaps
There are two common tyPEs of swaps:
* An interest rate swap that allows a company to swap its interest rate obligation (usually a fixed rate for a
floating rate) to manage interest rate risk; and
* A currency swap that allows a company to swap its debt service obligation from one currency to another
currency (usually from the debt instrument's denomination currency to its oPErating currency) to manage
currency risk.
5.4.2.1 Interest Rate Swaps
An interest rate swap is an agreement to exchange one stream of interest payments for another, based on a
sPEcified principal amount (also known as the notional amount), over a sPEcified PEriod and at sPEcified intervals
(also known as reset dates).
When one stream of the swap pays a fixed-rate interest payment and the other stream receives a floating-rate
interest payment, this is called a pay fixed, receive floating interest rate swap, also known as a plain vanilla swap.
Exhibit 5.1 presents the interest payment structure of a plain vanilla swap with a five-year term and an annual
reset date.

Receive -- Floating Leg
The fixed-rate stream in the swap is also known as the fixed leg. The fixed rate stays the same throughout the life
of the swap.
The floating-rate stream in the swap is also known as the floating leg. The floating rate is reset on each reset date,
which becomes the interest rate the floating leg is subject to until the next reset date. The floating leg payment is
calculated based on a reference rate. The most commonly used reference rate is LIBOR. Refer to ApPEndix 5B for
more details on recent developments in LIBOR.
One party pays the fixed-rate interest payment on each reset date and receives a floating-rate interest payment.
The floating rate for the next PEriod is reset to the prevailing market rate.
Notional amounts are not exchanged in interest rate swaps because these amounts are equal -- there is no need to
exchange the notional principal amounts.
5.4.2.2 Currency Swaps
A currency swap is a contract in which two counterparties agree to exchange payments in different currencies,
based on a sPEcified notional amount, over a sPEcified PEriod and at sPEcified intervals.
There are two notable differences between a currency swap and an interest rate swap:
* Each leg of the currency swap, which is denominated in two different currencies, can be either fixed or
floating; and
* The notional amounts of a currency swap, denominated in two different currencies, are typically exchanged.
5.4.3 Valuation of Swaps
Interest rate swaps are most commonly encountered by valuators, so this SECtion will use interest rate swaps as an
example. All the concepts and formulas discussed below also apply to currency swaps, as the fundamentals are
the same, but some modifications may be required.
Recall that swaps can be thought of as a series of forward contracts. An interest rate swap can be thought of as
a series of forward (interest rate) contracts whereby the exercise price is the fixed rate (also known as the swap
rate), and the underlying is the floating rate. One forward contract expires on a corresponding reset date of the
swap contract. All forward contracts have the same exercise price.
Recall that swap contracts, similar to forward and future contracts, have an initial value of zero. The exercise price
or swap rate of an interest rate swap can be solved by equating the value of the fixed leg to the floating leg. This
relationship is denoted in Formula 7:
91
05 -- Valuation of Financial Instruments -- Part 2 -- Derivative Instruments
Formula 7: Value of Swap Contract at Inception
V0 = 0 = Vfloat - Vfixed
Rearranging Formula 7:
Vfloat = Vfixed
Where:
V0 = the value of the swap at inception
Vfloat = the value of the floating leg
Vfixed = the value of the fixed leg
The value of the floating leg at inception is par because the interest payment is set to match the discount rate.2
Par is denoted as 1. In fact, at each of the reset dates, the value of the floating leg equals par for the same reason.
This relationship is denoted in Formula 8:
Formula 8: Value of Floating Leg of Swap Contract
Vfloat = 1
Where:
Vfloat = the value of the floating leg
Combining Formula 7 and Formula 8, the value of the fixed leg at inception is denoted in Formula 9:3

Formula 9 and Formula 10.

Since the coupon payments are fixed, Ct remains the unchanged throughout the life of the swap. As such, Ct can be simplified as C.

Applying the logic in Formula 7, during the life of the swap, the value of the swap contract equals the value of the
floating leg minus the value of the fixed leg. For simplicity, the value of the swap is calculated at each reset date.
Recall that the value of the floating leg equals par at each reset date. The value of the swap at each reset date (t)
is denoted in Formula 11:
Formula 11: Value of Swap Contract at a Given Point in Time
Vt = 1 - Vfixed,t
Where:
Vt = the value of the swap at time t
Vfixed,t = the value of the fixed leg at time t
During the life of the swap and at each reset date, the value of the fixed leg equals the present value of the
difference between the new fixed rate (rfixed,t) to be received and the fixed rate (rfixed,0) the contract is bound to
pay. The value of the swap contract (Vt) is denoted in Formula 12:

Example 5.2: Calculation of the Swap Rate at Inception
At time 0, you entered into a vanilla swap with a notional amount of $100 million and an expiration date in five
years. The swap floating leg references LIBOR and resets every year.
Since you have a long position on the vanilla swap, that means you will pay a fixed rate and receive a floating rate.
The current LIBOR rate is as follows:
LIBOR Term (t=0)

5.5 Options
5.5.1 Attributes of Options
Options give one party (the buyer) the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell the underlying. Options are
unilateral contracts because only one party (the seller) to the contract has a future commitment that, if broken,
represents a breach of contract. Unilateral contracts expose only the buyer to the risk that the seller will not fulfill
the contractual agreement.
Because of its unilateral nature, options have positive values for the buyer at the contract's inception. That is, the
option buyer pays this value, or the option premium, to the option seller at the time of the initial contract. The
option premium represents the maximum profit that the option seller can make.
Options may trade in the over-the-counter market, but they trade predominantly on an exchange. Options in the
over-the-counter market are customizable contracts, whereas options on an exchange are standardized contracts.
Generally, there are three exercise styles of options, which differ by the timing of exercise:
* A EuroPEan option -- the option can only be exercised on the expiration date;
* An American option -- the option can be exercised at any time up to the expiration date; and
* A Bermudan option -- a restricted form of an American option that can be exercised prior to the expiration
date but only at sPEcific set dates.
5.5.2 Common TyPEs of Options
There are two basic tyPEs of options: (1) options to buy the underlying, known as call options, and (2) options to
sell the underlying, known as put options.
In other words, an option buyer who buys a call option has the right, but not the obligation, to buy or call the
underlying from the option seller at the exercise price until the option expires. Conversely, the option buyer who
buys a put option has the right, but not the obligation, to sell or put the underlying to the option seller at the
exercise price until the option expires.
5.5.2.1 Call Options
Recall that a call option allows the holder to buy the underlying by paying the exercise price. Therefore, exercise is
justified only if the value of the underlying exceeds the exercise price. Otherwise, the holder would simply let the
call expire.
95
05 -- Valuation of Financial Instruments -- Part 2 -- Derivative Instruments
As such, a call option's value is dePEndent on the spot price of the underlying. The direction between the spot
price of the underlying and the exercise price is known as the option's moneyness. A call option can be in one of
three states of moneyness:
* A call option is in the money if the spot price is greater than the exercise price. In this case, the option would
be exercised;
* A call option is out of the money if the spot price is less than the exercise price. In this case, the option would
not be exercised; and
* A call option is at the money if the spot price and the exercise price are the same. In this case, the option may
be exercised.
The payoff of a call option (Ct) is denoted as in Formula 13:
Formula 13: Payoff Calculation for Call Options
Ct = Max(St - X,0)
Where:
Ct = the value of the call option at time t
St = the spot price of the underlying at time t
X = the exercise price established at inception
5.5.2.2 Put Options
Recall that a put option allows the holder to sell the underlying at the exercise price. Therefore, exercise is justified
only if the value of the underlying is below the exercise price. Otherwise, the holder would simply let the put expire.
As such, a put option can be in one of three states of moneyness:
* A put option is in the money if the spot price is less than the exercise price. In this case, the option would be
exercised;
* A put option is out of the money if the spot price is greater than the exercise price. In this case, the option
would not be exercised; and
* A put option is at the money if the spot price and the exercise price are the same. In this case, the option may
be exercised.
The value of a put option (Pt) is denoted in Formula 14:
Formula 14: Payoff Calculation for Put Options
Pt = Max(X - St,0)
Where:
Pt = the value of the put option at time t
St = the spot price of the underlying at time t
X = the exercise price established at inception
5.5.2.3 Put-Call Parity
Before diving into the details of valuing options, an important concept needs to be established: put-call parity,
which is the relationship between the price of a call option and the price of its corresponding put option.
For clarity, this refers to call and put options with identical underlyings, exercise prices, and expiration dates.
The put-call parity is denoted in Formula 15:

Where:
S0 = the spot price of the underlying at inception
P0 = the value of the put option at inception
C0 = the value of the call option at inception
X = the exercise price established at inception
T = the time to the expiration date
r = the risk-free rate
That is, the underlying price plus the put price equals the call price plus the present value of the exercise price.
The put-call parity is an important concept under the no-arbitrage assumption. If the value of a call option is
known, the value of a corresponding put option can be solved for, and vice versa. The put-call parity indicates the
difference in values for the corresponding call and put options.
A detailed explanation of the put-call parity is presented in ApPEndix 5A.
5.5.3 Valuation of Options
The valuation of options can be thought of as two parts: (1) modelling the price of the underlying, and
(2) calculating the option payoff based on the price of the underlying.
Generally, there are three methods to value options: (1) the closed-form method, (2) the lattice method, and
(3) the Monte Carlo simulation method.
With resPEct to modelling the price of the underlying, all three methods share similar assumptions as to how the
price of the underlying behaves. However, each method differs in the techniques in modelling.
With resPEct to the calculation of the option payoff, the closed-form method is generally suitable for simple exercise
styles such as EuroPEan options and a constant exercise price. In comparison, the lattice method and the Monte
Carlo simulation method are more suitable for complex exercise styles such as American and Bermudan options and
variable exercise prices. Both methods allow more customization in the calculation of the option payoff.
It's important to note that all three methods should yield the same results if valuing a simple EuroPEan option. This
point is demonstrated through Examples 5.4, 5.5, 5.6, and 5.7, which value the same EuroPEan call option under
each method. For simplicity, the discussion focuses on stock options on non-dividend-paying stocks.
5.5.3.1 Closed-Form Method (the Black-Scholes Formula)
The most commonly used closed-form method is the Black-Scholes formula, which is the focus of this SECtion.
The Black-Scholes formula is widely used by market participants to estimate the theoretical value of EuroPEan options.
It's also simple to use once a valuator understands the concept behind the formula -- simply plug in the variables.
Overall, the Black-Scholes formula estimates the value of an option based on the probability that the option will
be in the money at the expiration date, assuming the price of the underlying is random and follows a normal
distribution during the life of the option. The mathematical induction and explanations4 are beyond the scoPE of
this module.
4 Refer to the optional reading "The Pricing of Options and Corporate Liabilities" for full details on arriving at the Black-Scholes formula.
97
05 -- Valuation of Financial Instruments -- Part 2 -- Derivative Instruments
The Black-Scholes formula oPErates under six major assumptions:
* A EuroPEan style exercising (on the expiration date);
* The price of the underlying follows a normal distribution;
* The stock does not pay a dividend;
* The volatility of the underlying is constant;
* The risk-free rate is constant; and
* The market is efficient, and there are no transaction costs or taxes.
The Black-Scholes formula uses the put-call parity as discussed in SECtion 5.5.2.3 to derive the value of a call
option and a put option, as denoted in Formula 16 and Formula 17, resPEctively. Formula 18 and Formula 19 show
the two inputs into the Black-Scholes formula.

t = the remaining term to maturity (in years)
s = the annualized volatility of the underlying
Notably, the option value calculated using the Black-Scholes formula is most sensitive to the assumed volatility
and remaining term to maturity. The higher the volatility, the higher the option value as there is more variability
in the underlying share price, such that the probability of the option being in the money is higher. Likewise, the
longer the remaining term to maturity, the higher the option value as there is a higher chance of the option being
in the money for a longer time frame.
Most of the inputs to the Black-Scholes formula are directly observable, except for volatility. Volatility is a measure
of the degree of variation of the trading prices of the underlying over time, usually calculated as the standard

deviation of logarithmic returns. In simple terms, volatility indicates how high and how low the prices of the
underlying can go. Often, the historical trading prices of the underlying are used as a proxy, also known as the
historical volatility. Historical volatility can be inferred using Formula 20:

These expansions of the Black-Scholes formula are beyond the scoPE of this module.

At time 0, you are looking to buy a EuroPEan call option on a stock and would like to know the theoretical value of
the call option. Salient terms of the EuroPEan call option are as follows:
* Share price at time 0 (St): $100;
* Exercise price (X): $110;
* Term to maturity in years (t): 1;
* Risk-free rate (r): 5%; and
* Volatility (s): 20%.

Valuation of an Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) Using the Black-Scholes Formula
Often, a valuator is asked to estimate the value of an ESOP for financial reporting purposes. An ESOP typically has
the following unique asPEcts that a valuator would need to account for in its valuation:
* There is usually a vesting PEriod attached to an ESOP during which the option cannot be exercised;
* There is a probability that the employee will leave the company during the vesting PEriod -- this will typically
trigger a forfeiture of the option granted;
* There is a probability that the employee will leave the company after the vesting date and prior to the
maturity of the option -- this will trigger a forfeiture of the option if not exercised;
* There can be restrictions on transfer of the ESOP after the vesting date; and
* There can be a dilutive effect on the share price when an ESOP is exercised.
In estimating the exPEcted life of the ESOP, a valuator would need to account for the vesting PEriod as well as
forfeiture (the fIRSt three points above) by looking at historical behaviours. A discount for lack of marketability may
be applied (on top of the option value calculated using the Black-Scholes formula) to account for any restrictions on
transfer of the ESOP. In most cases, the dilution effect does not need to be taken into account as the traded share price
should reflect the effect of dilution once the announcement of the ESOP grant is made. However, entities planning
major unanticipated ESOP grants should consider the application of the dilution effect if it is unreasonable to assume
that the share price already reflects the market's assessment of the effect of the grant on the value of the shares.
Note: Although you should be able to demonstrate an understanding of the unique asPEcts of an ESOP, you will not
be asked to calculate an ESOP's value.
5.5.3.2 The Lattice Method (the Binomial Tree Method)
While the Black-Scholes formula is suitable for simple exercise styles such as EuroPEan options, the lattice method
is more suitable for complex exercise styles such as American and Bermudan options to take into account the
varying exercise dates that are inherent in the option.
In simple terms, the lattice method to value options involves building a "tree" consisting of two components:
(1) the nodes, which represent the value of the underlying at a discrete point in time, and (2) the branches, which
represent the directions of the value of the underlying for the next time PEriod.
100
05 -- Valuation of Financial Instruments -- Part 2 -- Derivative Instruments
The binomial tree method6 is most commonly used when only two possible outcomes are allowed -- one goes up
and one goes down. Again, for simplicity, this SECtion focuses on stock options on non-dividend-paying stocks.
The Concepts of the Binomial Tree Method
The spot price of the underlying at time 0 (t=0) can be denoted as S0. At each discrete point in time, also known as a
time step, the value of the underlying can either go up or down until it reaches the expiration date. An up factor and
a down factor are estimated based on an assumed volatility of the underlying (refer to Formula 21 and Formula 22 for
detailed calculations). The up factor and down factor will then be applied to the spot price to calculate the price of
the underlying in the next time PEriod. For example, in time 1 (t=1), the price of the underlying can be defined as S0*u
(price going up), or S0*d (price going down). The same calculation applies until the time step reaches the expiration date.
Exhibit 5.2 presents the binomial tree method in modelling the price of the underlying in two time stEPS. Note that
the price of the underlying is calculated in a forward fashion -- that is, starting from time 0 to the expiration date.

Once the prices of the underlying at each time step are known, the option payoff can be calculated using Formula 13
and Formula 14 for the call option and the put option, resPEctively. Note that the payoff calculation is backward,
starting from the expiration date back to time 0.
Since EuroPEan options can only be exercised on the expiration date, the payoff is calculated at the expiration
date (n=27). Exhibit 5.3 presents the binomial tree method to calculate the option payoff for EuroPEan options.
To determine whether the option will be exercised on the expiration date, compare the exercise price to the price
of the underlying at each of the nodes on the expiration date. The value at each node is then probability adjusted
and discounted back to time 0 to arrive at the option value. For clarity, the probability of the up factor or down
factor is calculated based on the values of the up factor and down factor (refer to Formula 23 and Formula 24
for detailed calculations). Each branch is assigned an associated probability of the up factor or down factor.
Each node is calculated as the probability-weighted sum of the option value of both the up and down branch,
discounted at the risk-free rate for one step. The calculation rePEats until the node reaches time 0.

For American options, since the payoff can be exercised at any time prior to the expiration date, it is calculated at each
time step. To determine whether the option will be exercised at each time step, compare the exercise price to the price
of the underlying. Starting from the expiration date (n=28), calculate the payoff at each of the nodes. These values are
discounted back one PEriod and compared to the payoff at the time step before (n=1). RePEat this process at each time
step until time 0. Exhibit 5.4 presents the binomial tree method to calculate the option payoff for American options.

Conclusion: Based on the two-step binomial tree method, the EuroPEan call option value is estimated to be $6.62
at time 0.
The Binomial Tree Method and Black-Scholes Formula Convergence
In Example 5.4, the output from the Black-Scholes formula is $6.04, and in Example 5.5, the output from the
two-step binomial tree method is $6.62 at time 0, a 10% difference in value. This SECtion looks at what causes this
difference and how the two methods can converge.
Starting with the binomial tree method, recall Example 5.5, which set up a two-step binomial tree. That is, it is
assumed the underlying stock price only moved twice in a year (or during the life of the option), once at the
six-month point and the other at the 12-month point. At each node, the underlying stock price will either go up
or down once. As such, the two-step binomial tree yielded three prices of the underlying at the expiration date.
Simply put, there isn't enough movement in the underlying stock price. As such, the basis of the option valuation
(the possible stock prices) is not sufficient.
The general rule of thumb is, the more time stEPS a binomial tree has, the more underlying stock prices will be
calculated, and the more accurate the option valuation is.
In addition, as more underlying stock prices are calculated, the totality of the stock prices will resemble a normal
distribution. Most of the stock prices will be around the average, with a limited number of extremes on the high
end and low end of the value sPEctrum. This pattern is similar to the Black-Scholes formula assumption that the
underlying stock prices follow a normal distribution.
Example 5.6 demonstrates the convergence between the binomial tree method and the Black-Scholes formula.
Example 5.6: Valuation of a EuroPEan Call Option Using a Multiple-Step
Binomial Tree Method
Similar to Example 5.5, this example uses the binomial tree method to estimate the value of the EuroPEan call
option at time 0. This time, the number of stEPS is expanded to 150 (from two stEPS used in the previous example).
That is, the underlying stock price moves every 2.5 days. The graph below summarizes the calculation.

5.5.3.3 Monte Carlo Simulation Method
While the Black-Scholes formula is suitable for simple exercise styles such as EuroPEan options, and the lattice
method is suitable for American and Bermudan options to address features such as varying exercise dates, the
Monte Carlo simulation method is most suitable for customized options with both varying exercise prices and
varying exercise dates. For example, if the exercise price changes dePEnding on certain metrics or the timing of
the exercise, the Monte Carlo simulation method is equipPEd with the flexibility to customize the calculation of
exercise prices and payoffs at each PEriod and scenario.
The Monte Carlo simulation method is a bROAd class of computational algorithms that rely on rePEated random
sampling to obtain numerical results. In simple terms, it is a random number simulator with capabilities to compute
user-defined calculations. The user can also define how the end result of the simulation looks -- for example,
whether it follows a normal distribution.9
For simplicity, the discussion focuses on applying the Monte Carlo simulation method to value a EuroPEan option
on non-dividend-paying stocks. Assume the price of the underlying follows a normal distribution, similar to that of
the Black-Scholes formula.
Overall, the Monte Carlo simulation method in option pricing consists of three stEPS:
1. Calculate (or simulate) the potential future prices of the underlying at the expiration date.
2. Calculate the payoff of the option for each of the potential underlying prices.
3. Discount the payoffs back to time 0 and average them to determine the option value.
The Monte Carlo simulation method, in essence, is similar to the lattice method (binomial tree method), whereby
the future prices of the underlying are modelled out, then the corresponding option payoff is calculated. The
difference lies in the technique in modelling the prices of the underlying.
Note: Although you should demonstrate an understanding of the characteristics of a Monte Carlo simulation
method, you will not be asked to PErform a calculation using this appROAch. Therefore, no formula is provided.
Example 5.7 demonstrates the application of the Monte Carlo simulation method in calculating the option value of
a EuroPEan call option. The purpose is to show a convergence between the three methods -- that is, in valuing a
simple EuroPEan option, with the same assumptions, the Black-Scholes formula, the binomial tree method, and the
Monte Carlo simulation method yield similar outputs.
Example 5.7: Valuation of a EuroPEan Call Option Using the Monte Carlo
Simulation Method
Recall from Example 5.4 that you are looking to buy a EuroPEan call option on a stock and would like to know the
theoretical value of the call option (or the premium) you need to pay at time 0. Salient terms of the EuroPEan call
option are as follows:
* Share price at time 0 (St): $100;
* Exercise price (X): $110;
* Term to maturity in years (t): 1;
* Risk-free rate (r): 5%;
* Volatility (s): 20%; and
* Time step (n): 2.
9
Other common distribution patterns that can be defined in a Monte Carlo simulation include: (1) lognormal distribution (positively
skewed and asymmetrical), (2) uniform distribution (user defines a range of possible values and all values have an equal chance
of occurring within the range), (3) triangular distribution (user defines minimum, most likely, and maximum values), (4) discrete
distribution (user defines sPEcific values and the likelihood of occurrence).

Solution:
This example uses the Monte Carlo simulation method PErformed in Excel.
Step 1 -- Calculate (or simulate) the potential future prices of the underlying using the geometric Brownian
motion10 25,000 times, which gives 25,000 different future prices of the underlying at the expiration date.
Step 2 -- Calculate the option payoff for each of the 25,000 prices of the underlying calculated in Step 1.
Step 3 -- Calculate the option value by taking the average of the present value11 of all the option payoffs.

That is, based on 25,000 simulations, the average (mean) share price at the expiration date is $105.24, with a
maximum of $248.54 and a minimum of $42.80. The corresponding option payoff in future value averaged $6.36
with a maximum of $138.54 and a minimum of $0. The average option payoff of $6.36 is then discounted back to
time 0 using the risk-free rate -- this gives the option value of $6.05 at time 0.
Conclusion: Based on the Monte Carlo simulation method, the EuroPEan call option value is estimated to be $6.05
at time 0. Comparing to the output from the Black-Scholes formula of $6.04, the difference is 0.2% in value, which
is insignificant.
5.6 Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) and DEBIT Valuation Adjustment
(DVA)
For financial reporting purposes, IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement provides a framework for determining fair value.
This framework lays out the factors to be considered and the key principles to be applied in measuring all assets
and liabilities, including financial instruments.
SPEcifically, IFRS 13 requires the credit risk of a counterparty and the entity's own credit risk to be taken into
account in valuing financial instruments.
The valuation of debt instruments as discussed in Module 4 considers an entity's own credit risk in selecting an
appropriate discount rate. There is no counterparty risk as debt instruments are unilateral contracts in which only
the debtholders are exposed to credit risk. Therefore, no further adjustment is required.
Derivative instruments, on the other hand, are valued under a risk-neutral framework, and the valuation excludes
consideration of credit risks. Therefore, an adjustment is required to consider the counterparty credit risk, also
known as the CVA, and the entity's own credit risk, also known as the DVA. CVA and DVA are, in essence, the
exPEcted credit loss valuation adjustments to the risk-neutral value of the derivatives, as discussed in this module.
CVA and DVA are relatively new requirements under the accounting standards. As such, there is no standardized
appROAch to estimating CVA and DVA among market participants. Large financial institutions (like banks) that
are exposed to significant CVA and DVA adjustments typically use sophisticated methods that simulate different
scenarios of defaults and the exPEcted credit losses associated with each scenario. Refer to Module 6, Example 6.1
for an example of application of CVA.
110
05 -- Valuation of Financial Instruments -- Part 2 -- Derivative Instruments
For banks who are market makers of derivative instruments, the consideration for pricing adjustments also
includes the funding valuation adjustment, the margin valuation adjustment, and the capital valuation adjustment.
Collectively with CVA and DVA, the various components of pricing adjustments are known as XVAs.
The funding valuation adjustment refers to the cost associated with funding an uncollateralized derivative position.
It can be thought of as two components: (1) a funding cost adjustment that reflects the cost of funding derivatives
when they have a positive value, and (2) a funding benefit adjustment that reflects the benefit of holding
derivatives that have a negative value. The funding valuation adjustment is the net cost combining the funding
cost adjustment and funding benefit adjustment.
Margin valuation adjustment refers to the cost associated with the initial margin posted with a clearing house, in
the case where a derivative is cleared through a central clearing party (which is a common practice these days).
Capital valuation adjustment refers to the cost to the bank associated with capital requirements for having
the derivative exposure throughout the life of the contract. This concept is rooted in the capital adequacy
requirements imposed on a bank's oPErations, whereby each product offering has a funding requirement, and as
such, by offering derivative instruments to clients, the bank incurs capital requirement costs.
Note: Although you should demonstrate an understanding of the concepts of CVA and DVA, you will not be asked
to PErform a calculation.

ApPEndix 5A: The Put-Call Parity
Recall that put-call parity is the relationship between the price of a call option and the price of its corresponding
put option. This apPEndix provides examples to explain this concept. For simplicity, this apPEndix uses EuroPEan
style options. That is, the call and put option can only be exercised on the expiration date.
Suppose Investor A owns an asset that has a current price of S0. The asset makes no cash payments and has no
carrying costs. The end of the holding PEriod is time T, at which point the asset will be worth ST. Concerned by the
possibility that ST will decline, Investor A buys a put option with an exercise price of X, which can be used to sell
the asset for X at time T. This put option is worth P0 at time 0. Combined with the value of the asset, the investor's
current position is worth S0 + P0, which is the investor's money at risk. This position of holding the asset and a put
is called a protective put.
At expiration, the value of the asset is ST. The value of the put will be either zero or X - ST. If the asset increases
in value such that ST >= X, then the overall position is worth ST. The asset has appreciated in value, and the investor
will let the put expire. If the asset value declines to the point at which ST < X, the asset is worth ST, and the put
is worth X - ST, for a total of X. In other words, the investor would exercise the put, selling the asset for X, which
exceeds the asset's value at time t (ST).
In summary, Investor A benefits from unlimited upside potential, with the downside value protected at X. Exhibit 5A.1
presents the payoff of a protective put. The graph on the left illustrates the underlying asset and the put. The graph
on the right shows their combined effects.

Consider Investor B. At time 0, this investor buys a call option on this asset with an exercise price of X that expires
at T and a risk-free zero-coupon bond with a face value of X that matures at T. The call costs C0, and the bond
costs the present value of X, which is X/(1 + r)T. Thus, Investor B invested a total of C0 + X/(1 + r)T. This position is
known as a fiduciary call.
If the underlying price exceeds the exercise price at expiration, the call will be worth ST - X, and the bond will
mature and pay a value of X. These values combine to equal ST. Suppose the underlying price does not exceed the
exercise price at expiration. In that case, the call expires worthless, and the bond is worth X for a combined value
of X. Exhibit 5A.2 shows the PErformance of the fiduciary call. The graph on the left shows the call and bond, and
the graph on the right shows the combined effects of the two strategies.

Comparing Exhibit 5A.1 with Exhibit 5A.2 shows that a protective put and a fiduciary call produce the same result.
Recall that Investor A committed funds of S0 + P0, while Investor B committed funds of C0 + X/(1 + r)T. If both
investors receive the same payoffs at time T regardless of the asset price at T, the amounts they invest at time
0 have to be the same. Therefore, the put-call parity is arrived at, as stated in Formula 15 and restated below:

ApPEndix 5B: LIBOR Reform
What Is the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)?
LIBOR is a set of benchmark interest rates intended to represent the level at which major global banks estimate to
borrow from and lend to one another in the international interbank market for short-term loans on an unSECured
basis. LIBOR is calculated and published daily across five currencies (USD, GBP, EUR, CHF, and JPY) and seven
tenors (overnight, 1-week, 1-month, 2-month, 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month). LIBOR is used as a rate index in a
wide range of products globally, most notably derivative products as well as corporate loans and bonds.
Why Is LIBOR Going Away?
Despite its status as the global benchmark for interest rates, the market that LIBOR seeks to measure is no longer
active. Therefore, LIBOR sometimes behaved in unpredictable and volatile ways, such as during the financial crisis
in 2007-2008. Moreover, LIBOR is a survey-based rate calculated based on submissions from participating banks,
which is subject to manipulation. Most notable was the LIBOR-manipulation scandal in September 2012, which
triggered the global LIBOR reform to use a transaction-based risk-free rate as the replacement benchmark.
When Is LIBOR Going Away?
The discontinuation dates for LIBOR are as follows:
* December 31, 2021, for 1-week and 2-month USD LIBOR;
* December 31, 2021, for GBP, EUR, CHF, and JPY LIBOR; and
* June 30, 2023, for overnight, 1-month, 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month USD LIBOR.
What Alternative Rates Will Replace LIBOR?
The alternative rates, which are fully transaction-based, represent rates in each major currency where the
credit, liquidity, and other risks are minimal (and therefore nearly risk free). SPEcifically, the alternative rates
are calculated based on the cost of overnight repurchase transactions (repos) using treasury bills and bonds as
collateral.
Table 1 summarizes the alternative rate in each of the major currencies that replaces the LIBOR.

In short, SOFR and USD LIBOR measure different rates, and as such, there is a spread difference between SOFR
and USD LIBOR. Generally, SOFR is a lower rate in comparison to USD LIBOR, as it excludes credit and term risk.
What Are the Implications?
To understand the implication of LIBOR reform, fIRSt the asset classes that reference LIBOR as the benchmark rate
must be explained. Using USD LIBOR as an example and based on the volume traded in March 2018,12 derivative
products represent the largest asset class that reference USD LIBOR (approximately 96% of total volume),
followed by business loans (2%), bonds (1%), SECuritization (1%), and consumer loans (1%).
In the U.S. market, the transition to SOFR is well underway.
For derivatives that are governed by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association Master Agreement,
a standard document regularly used to govern over-the-counter derivatives transactions, the association has
implemented a fallback provision to incorporate the mechanics of reference rate adjustments that came into effect
in January 2021. SPEcifically, once USD LIBOR is discontinued, a fixed spread will be added to the alternative rate
(risk-free rate), which is calculated based on the median of the spreads observed between SOFR and the USD
LIBOR using a look-back PEriod of five years. The intent is to make both parties "whole." Most new issuances of
derivatives (particularly swaps and futures) now reference SOFR as the benchmark.
For debt instruments, a fallback protocol similar to the International Swaps and Derivatives Association reference
rate adjustment has been incorporated in new issuances since 2018. The debt market is also moving toward using
SOFR as the benchmark rate for floating-rate note issuances from an adoption standpoint. Fannie Mae issued the
fIRSt SOFR-linked floating-rate note in July 2018 with a notional amount of $6 billion. As of January 2021, more
than 60%13 of the private SECtor's new issuances of floating-rate notes adopted SOFR as the reference rate.
The Canadian Dollar Offer Rate (CDOR) and the Canadian Overnight Repo Rate Average (CORRA)
The LIBOR equivalent in Canada is the CDOR. While CDOR is also survey-based, CDOR represents a committed
bank lending rate, where the banks are willing to extend credit to existing corporate borrowers referencing CDOR
plus a spread.
As part of the global LIBOR reform, the Bank of Canada adopts an alternative interest rate benchmark, CORRA, as
a key risk-free interest rate benchmark in Canada.
CORRA is calculated based on actual transactions observed in the overnight repo market using the Government of
Canada Treasury bills and bonds as collateral, like other alternative rates.
While currently there are no plans to discontinue CDOR, it is exPEcted that its relevance will decline as markets
globally move to adopt a transition-based risk-free rate as the benchmark. In February 2021, the Royal Bank of
Canada issued the fIRSt floating-rate note referencing CORRA with a notional amount of $500 million.

05 -- Valuation of Financial Instruments -- Part 2 -- Derivative Instruments
Key Takeaway
For legacy instruments issued before January 2022 and referencing LIBOR as the benchmark, the fallback
provision needs to be applied in computing the exPEcted cash flows for the instrument. With resPEct to discount
rate selection, since January 2022, the alternative rates have started being used as the basis for risk-free rates.
An adjustment to the risk-free rate will be required in building up the discount rate used, particularly for debt
instruments.

Welcome to Module 6. This module provides an overview of contingent consideration, which is a customized
financial instrument commonly seen in business combinations. The valuation methods available for contingent
consideration and the application of each method is then discussed.
The module then discusses real options, which are economically valuable rights but not obligations to a company
regarding business projects and investment opportunities. The module elaborates on evaluating real options using
the option pricing methods develoPEd for financial instruments as discussed in Module 5. The evaluation of real
options is also known as real options thinking, which presents an alternative tool for management in assessing
business projects.
By the end of this module, you will be able to:
* Describe the characteristics of contingent consideration;
* IdentiFY appROAches to value determination for contingent consideration;
* Explain fair value considerations that are unique to contingent consideration;

6.1 Contingent Consideration
6.1.1 Overview of Contingent Consideration
Contingent consideration is the obligation of an acquirer to transfer additional assets or equity interests to the
vendors of the acquired entity on meeting certain sPEcified future events or conditions. Contingent consideration
is usually negotiated as part of a business combination in which control of the acquiree is transferred. Contingent
consideration is also known as an earnout. In this module, the term earnout is used interchangeably with
contingent consideration.
Contingent consideration is typically included in the purchase consideration for one of the following purposes:
* To bridge a valuation gap -- The buyer and seller in a transaction may have different views on the value of
the acquiree, often due to different opinions regarding the outlook and risks for the acquired business or
the likelihood of certain post-acquisition events. This gap can be bridged by agreeing on an upfront price
consistent with the buyer's PErception while providing for a contingent payment in the future if the seller's
more optimistic outlook is achieved;
* To provide alternative financing -- The buyer and seller can use contingent consideration to defer a portion of
the purchase consideration to a later date;
* To retain a seller post-transaction -- If the buyer wishes to retain a vendor after the transaction (e.g., to
continue as an employee or consultant of the acquiree), contingent consideration can be used to engage and
incentivize the seller for their continuous involvement and contribution; or
* To share risk and reward -- The buyer may want to share the risk and reward relating to the business's future
PErformance with the sellers.
Sometimes, contingent consideration is structured with a clawback clause that gives the acquirer the right to claw
back previously transferred consideration if certain sPEcified conditions are met.
In a financial reporting context, contingent consideration is required to be measured at fair value as of the
acquisition date, under ASC 805, IFRS 3, and ASPE 1582.1
6.1.2 Characteristics of Contingent Consideration
6.1.2.1 Underlying Metrics
Underlying metrics (or just metrics) refer to the criteria whose value or occurrence will determine the amount of
contingent consideration to be paid. Typically, they are quantifiable measures the parties can use to track, monitor,
and assess the success or failure of the acquired business post-acquisition.
The underlying metrics can be categorized into the following two tyPEs:
* Financial metrics, which are commonly reported financial PErformance figures (such as revenue, EBITDA, net
income, etc.) or certain management metrics that are closely related to financial PErformance (such as the
number of units sold, rental occupancy rates, etc.); and
* Non-financial metrics or milestone events such as regulatory approvals, resolution of legal disputes, execution
of certain commercial contracts or retention of customers, the closing of a future transaction, achievement
of technical milestones (such as completion of a product launch or a stage of product development or a
construction project), and so on.
There could be one metric or multiple metrics dictating the payoff of contingent consideration.

6.1.2.2 Payoff Structure
There is a bROAd sPEctrum of payoff structures for contingent consideration. On one end, the payoff may be
structured simply as a fixed PErcentage of an underlying metric, also known as a linear payoff structure. For
example, an earnout structure where a vendor receives 50% of the acquiree's EBITDA over a sPEcified PEriod of
time is a linear payoff structure.
On the other end, payoff structures may be complex and include a minimum threshold in which no payment is
made, a cap limiting the maximum payoff, a tiered structure in which different rates are assigned to each tier
of PErformance, or carryforward provisions that link payment in one PEriod to the PErformance in subsequent
PEriods. This structure is also known as a non-linear payoff structure.
6.1.2.3 Settlement
The settlement method of contingent consideration can be cash; transfer of assets, liabilities, or equities; or a
combination of various forms.
6.1.3 Valuation AppROAches for Contingent Consideration
Recall from Level I that there are generally three valuation appROAches: the asset-based, market-based, and
income-based appROAches. This SECtion discusses each appROAch in the context of valuing contingent consideration.
Contingent consideration, similar to a derivative contract, derives its value from the underlying business. Yet, it
has no ownership of the underlying. As such, the asset-based appROAch is not appropriate for valuing contingent
consideration.
Contingent consideration is not a standardized financial instrument and has no active trading market. As such, the
market appROAch is generally not applicable for valuing contingent consideration.
Therefore, an income-based appROAch is most applicable in estimating the fair value of contingent consideration.
SECtion 6.1.4 elaborates on certain fair value considerations that are unique to valuing contingent consideration;
the following SECtions then discuss the application of valuation methods commonly used by valuators.
6.1.4 Fair Value Considerations Unique to Contingent Consideration
Contingent consideration is similar to a derivative instrument in that its value is derived from the underlying metric.
There could be a wide range of possible outcomes associated with the underlying metric. Each outcome leads
to a different future cash flow profile and payoff. Therefore, valuators need to consider a wide range of possible
outcomes in valuing contingent consideration, instead of a single most likely measure.
One method is to develop future scenarios relevant to the underlying metric and estimate the likelihood of each
scenario. This method is known as the scenario-based method and is explained in SECtion 6.1.5.
An alternative method is to estimate a range of possible outcomes based on the most likely case, such as
management's best estimate. This method uses some option pricing models develoPEd for valuing financial
options, known as the option pricing method, which is explained in SECtion 6.1.6.
6.1.5 Income AppROAch -- The Scenario-Based Method
In simple terms, the scenario-based method consists of:
1.
IdentiFYing the possible outcomes associated with the underlying metric;
2. Assigning a probability of occurrence to each outcome;
3. Calculating the weighted average of all outcomes; and
4. Discounting the result at an appropriate discount rate to arrive at the present value of the contingent
consideration.
121
06 -- Valuation of Financial Instruments -- Part 3 -- Contingent Consideration and Real Options
6.1.5.1 Develop Scenarios
The primary goal when developing scenarios is to adequately represent the full range of probable outcomes
associated with the underlying metrics over the relevant PEriods. From a statistical standpoint, the more granular
the scenarios, the higher the accuracy of the outcomes. However, a valuator needs to balance the need for
statistical accuracy with the additional subjectivity introduced in developing many scenarios and probabilities.
A valuator should also examine management's assessments meticulously, challenge whether management has
adequately considered both the probability of various scenarios and a wide enough range of potential outcomes,
and challenge the consistency of these scenarios and probabilities with other assumptions in the analysis. Exhibit 6.1
demonstrates the concept of identiFYing a full range of possible outcomes and assigning a probability of
occurrence to each outcome.

6.1.5.2 Select the Appropriate Discount Rate
A valuator needs to select an appropriate discount rate reflecting the risks associated with the contingent
consideration payments, similar to a business valuation. For clarity, this module assumes a risk-adjusted framework
in which market participants require a risk premium over the risk-free rate to comPEnsate for any additional risks
that the contingent consideration payments are subject to. Since the payments are dePEndent on achieving the
underlying metrics, considerations for any additional risks are tied to the risk exposures of the underlying metrics.
In selecting the appropriate discount rate, a valuator needs to consider the following three components:
* The time value of money;
* A risk premium associated with the underlying metric; and
* Counterparty credit risk.
The time value of money and the counterparty credit risk components are applicable from the valuation date to
the exPEcted payment dates.
However, the risk premium associated with the underlying metric component is applicable only from the valuation
date until the uncertainty related to the metric is fully resolved. This component is the critical factor in selecting
the appropriate discount rate for contingent consideration; hence, it is the focus of this SECtion.
122
06 -- Valuation of Financial Instruments -- Part 3 -- Contingent Consideration and Real Options
Estimate Time Value of Money
This component is captured by the risk-free rate commensurate with the exPEcted timing of the contingent
consideration payments.
Estimate Risk Premium Associated with the Underlying Metric -- Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) Framework
Level I and Level II introduced two key concepts associated with the CAPM framework: (1) the tyPEs of risks that
investors face, and (2) the CAPM formula for estimating the cost of equity. The CAPM framework can be used as a
guide for estimating the risk premium associated with the underlying metric.
Under the CAPM framework, investors face two kinds of risks:
* Systematic risk is meant to capture the uncertainties associated with future cash flows resulting from marketwide events that threaten the bROAd market, such as wars, recession, inflation, and so on. Systematic risk
affects all asset classes in the bROAd market and cannot be diversified; and
* Unsystematic risk is meant to capture the uncertainties particular to the asset and is not associated with the
bROAd market. In theory, unsystematic risk can be diversified.
The concept of systematic versus unsystematic risk can be applied to decipher the tyPE of underlying metric,
which then affects the inclusion of the risk premium associated with the metric. Note that dePEnding on the tyPE
of risk, the risk premium is either reflected in the discount rate or in the cash flows.
* Contingent consideration tied to a non-financial metric is exposed to unsystematic risk since the non-financial
metric is typically unique to the underlying business (such as achieving a product development) and largely
unaffected by the bROAder market. In this case, a market participant would not require a risk premium for the
contingent consideration payments. As such, the appropriate discount rate for the non-financial metric is the
risk-free rate of return, and the risk premium is reflected in the cash flows.2
* Contingent consideration tied to a financial metric may be exposed to systematic risk since the financial metric
is usually dePEndent on the bROAder market; for example, achieving certain revenue figures is negatively affected
by recession yet positively impacted by inflation. In this case, a market participant would typically require a risk
premium, as reflected in the discount rate, over the risk-free rate to comPEnsate for the additional risk exposures.
CAPM Formula -- Application in Estimating the Required Metric Risk Premium (RMRP)
The RMRP measures the risk premium that the investors demand to bear the systematic risk associated with an
earnout metric. The CAPM formula can be used to estimate a company's return on equity, which can then lead to
the determination of the RMRP. The CAPM formula is presented below:
requity = rrisk-free + b x rmarket risk premium + rsize + rcompany sPEcific
Where:
requity = the estimated return on equity
rrisk-free = the risk-free rate
b = the correlated volatility of the company's stock price with the volatility of the market benchmark
rmarket risk premium = the market risk premium
rsize = the size premium
rcompany sPEcific = the company-sPEcific risk premium
2 For clarity, the risks associated with the metric (such as the execution risk of meeting a product development milestone) are reflected
in the development of cash flow scenarios discussed in SECtion 6.1.5.1. As such, no adjustment for non-financial metric risk is required
in the discount rate build-up.

06 -- Valuation of Financial Instruments -- Part 3 -- Contingent Consideration and Real Options
Note that a company's return on equity is a levered measure. In contrast, the financial metric used as the earnout
metric is usually unlevered3 (for example, revenue or EBITDA). When a company is valued using a WACC, the
valuator will need to adjust and arrive at an unlevered discount rate when valuing contingent consideration based
on unlevered financial metrics.
Two methods are commonly used to estimate the RMRP associated with a financial metric: the top-down method
and the bottom-up method.
The top-down method starts with the discount rate for the company's long-term free cash flows (LTFCF) for
the overall business enterprise -- such as the estimated WACC -- and deducts the risk-free rate to arrive at a
benchmark risk premium. The benchmark risk premium reflects the total risk premium between the LTFCF and a
risk-free rate (i.e., if the WACC of a business is 12% and the appropriate risk-free rate 2%, then the benchmark risk
premium would be 10%). The benchmark risk premium is then adjusted for the differences between the LTFCF and
the earnout metric, such as:
* The short-term nature of the earnout metric;
* Differences in oPErational leverage between the LTFCF and the earnout metric, for example:
* OPErational leverage refers to the oPErating cost structure of the business and is calculated as the ratio
of fixed cost over revenue. It measures how well a company uses its fixed-cost items such as machinery
and equipment to generate revenue. The more revenue a company can earn on the same amount of fixed
assets, the higher its oPErating leverage;
* If the earnout metric is based on revenue, a valuator will need to de-lever the benchmark risk premium4
since revenue is not subject to oPErational leverage, which is implicit in the LTFCF; or
* If the earnout metric is based on earnings figures (such as EBIT and EBITDA), no adjustment is required as
the earnout metric is subject to the same oPErational leverage as the LTFCF;
* Differences attributable to which synergies are included or excluded by the definition of the earnout metric
(refer to ApPEndix 6A for further discussion on synergies); and
* Other differences between the LTFCF and the earnout metric with resPEct to a size premium and a companysPEcific premium.
The internal rate of return on the transaction is also commonly used as the starting point for the top-down
method. The internal rate of return of a transaction is the discount rate that causes the sum of the present value
of future cash flows of a target business to be equal to the total value of the purchase price paid. The mechanics
of calculating an internal rate of return are discussed further in Level IV and the Valuation for Financial Reporting
courses.
The bottom-up method starts with estimating the beta of an earnout metric and multiplying this beta by the
market risk premium to arrive at a benchmark risk premium. (The beta of an earnout metric can be theoretically
different than the beta of the overall oPErations of a business.) The benchmark risk premium is adjusted to
incorporate additional risk premiums applicable to the earnout metric regarding size and company-sPEcific risk
premiums.
Note: For Level III course assignments and exam, you will be provided with the earnout metric's beta (no
calculation of the earnout metric's beta is required).
Exhibit 6.2 presents the two methods for estimating the RMRP under the CAPM framework.
3 This refers to financial leverage.
4 Though beyond this course, conceptually, this de-levering would consider the amount of fixed costs relative to variable costs for the
business.

In determining the portion of the additional risk premium that applies to the earnout metric under both methods,
a valuator needs to consider the portion of the risk exposure that the earnout metric is subject to relative to the
underlying business. The following are examples of such considerations:
* In assessing the size premium -- The extent to which the business relevant to the earnout is anticipated to be
integrated with the acquirer. The more integrated the business, the more the size premium resembles that of
the acquirer's business (vs. that of the acquiree); and
* In assessing the company-sPEcific risk premium -- The extent of the riskiness of the business. If the premium
included in the WACC reflects the higher risk of aggressive projections solely for LTFCF, but not higher risk
throughout the earnout PEriod, then a lower company-sPEcific risk premium may be appropriate for the
earnout metric. Similarly, if the rationale for the company-sPEcific risk premium is to address significant nearterm risk or aggressive projections relevant to the earnout metric, then including the full company-sPEcific risk
premium may be appropriate.
Estimate Counterparty Credit Risk
Recall from Module 5 that IFRS 13 explicitly requires the credit risk of a counterparty and the entity's own credit
risk to be taken into account in valuing financial instruments. This requirement is also applicable to contingent
consideration. As such, the discount rate used in valuing contingent consideration must consider the obligator's
credit risk (or counterparty risk).
6.1.5.3 Decide on In-PEriod Discounting Convention
The practice of discounting cash flows using a mid-PEriod convention is widely used as a practical approximation
to allow for the time value and risk of financial metrics that are earned over a PEriod, as opposed to at a single
point in time. Predicting the timing of when the underlying metric will be met can be difficult. Therefore, a valuator
often assumes that the financial metric is earned at the midpoint of the PEriod to which it applies.

Example 6.1: Valuation of Contingent Consideration Using the ScenarioBased AppROAch
Founded in 2018, Aura Cannabis is a medical and recreational cannabis producer with 100 retail stores across Canada.
Aura Cannabis has four growing facilities for cultivation and one processing facility to convert grown flower into
various products ready for sale. The growing facilities are reaching maturity and are exPEcted to produce PEak
volumes of flower for the next five years. However, the processing facility is currently at capacity and can only process
approximately 50% of the grown flower into consumer products. The remaining flower is sold as raw products at a
lower margin. The processing capacity is currently the bottleneck limiting the future growth of the company.
On December 31, 2021, the sole owner of Aura Cannabis, Whitney, agreed to sell 80% of the outstanding shares of
Aura Cannabis to Capital Partners for total consideration of $150 million in cash. As part of the transaction, Whitney is
entitled to a contingent consideration payment of 30% of the cumulative revenue earned between FY2022 and FY2024.
Required:
Whitney has engaged you to estimate the fair value of the contingent consideration as of December 31, 2021 (the
valuation date).
Solution:
Based on discussion with management, you have develoPEd three scenarios and identified the probability of each
occurrence as follows:
* Scenario 1: The company plans to oPEn a new processing plant that will reach full capacity in FY2022 to
double the existing processing capacity. The company is planning to retain its existing retail footprint. Under
this scenario, the exPEcted revenue for each of FY2022, FY2023, and FY2024 is $28.2 million, $42.3 million,
and $42.3 million, resPEctively. The probability of this scenario is 40%.
* Scenario 2: The company plans to oPEn a new processing plant and to concurrently double its retail locations
to 200 stores by FY2022. Each retail store is assumed to reach PEak sales by FY2023. Under this scenario, the
revenue for each of FY2022, FY2023, and FY2024 is exPEcted to be $28.2 million, $56.4 million, and $56.4
million, resPEctively. The probability of this scenario is 30%.
* Scenario 3: The company plans to oPEn a new processing plant and to concurrently double its retail locations
by FY2022. However, under this scenario, due to increasing comPEtition, all retail locations suffer from
a remarkable decline in sales in FY2022. All stores only reach 50% of the targeted PEak sales in FY2023
and FY2024. Under this scenario, the revenue for each of FY2022, FY2023, and FY2024 is exPEcted to be
$14.1 million, $28.2 million, and $28.2 million, resPEctively. The probability of this scenario is 30%.
Table 1 summarizes each of these scenarios, as well as the probability of occurrence. The probability-weighted
average of the contingent consideration payment is calculated to be $32.6 million.

06 -- Valuation of Financial Instruments -- Part 3 -- Contingent Consideration and Real Options
Based on discussion with management as well as your indePEndent industry and company research, you arrived at
the following market data:
* Long-term risk-free rate: 4.0%;
* Three-year risk-free rate: 3.0%;
* Market risk premium: 5.0%;
* Beta for the company's equity: 1.0;
* Beta for the earnout metric: 0.3;
* Size premium for the company: 3.5%;
* The company-sPEcific risk premium: 6.5%;
* Debt to equity ratio: 0%;
* Credit spread for the obligator (i.e., appropriate spread for credit valuation adjustment): 2.0%; and
* OPErational leverage: 50%.
You have decided to use both the top-down and bottom-up methods to estimate the RMRP associated with the
earnout metric. Details of your analysis are as follows:
The Top-Down Method
1. Estimate the WACC for the business based on the CAPM formula to be 19.0% as the company has no debt.
2. Estimate the benchmark risk premium to be 15.0% by subtracting the long-term risk-free rate from the
WACC for the business.
3. Consider the following differences between the LTFCF and the earnout metric (revenue):
* The duration difference is determined to be 1.0% based on the term difference observed in the risk-free
rates (4.0% - 3.0%);
* The financial leverage difference is determined to be nil as the company has no debt;
* The oPErational leverage difference is determined to be 50.0% based on an analysis of the historical
oPErating leverage;
* The difference attributable to synergies is determined to be nil as the acquirer has no prior history
oPErating in the cannabis industry; and
* The difference with resPEct to size premium and company-sPEcific premium is determined to be nil
as the acquired business continues to oPErate as a stand-alone entity, and the earnout metric is tied to
the entirety of the oPEration.
The RMRP for the earnout metric is estimated to be 6.5% under the top-down method, as summarized in Table 2.

risk premium.
2. Estimate the portion of size and company-sPEcific risk premium applicable to the earnout metric to be
approximately 50.0% of the business's overall size and company-sPEcific risk premium. Considering the
acquiree will continue to oPErate as a stand-alone entity and the business's underlying risk exposures
remains the same as before the acquisition, you triangulated the attribution portion based on the
oPErational leverage of 50.0%, as it represents the portion of risk exposure the earnout metric is subject
to in proportion to the overall business.
The RMRP for the earnout metric is estimated to be 6.5% under the bottom-up method, as summarized in Table 3.

6.1.6 Income AppROAch -- The Option Pricing Method
The option pricing method uses a statistical calculation to estimate the possible outcomes of the underlying
metric based on management's best estimate. The average of all outcomes is then discounted at the risk-free rate
to arrive at the exPEcted present value of the contingent consideration.
There are two major differences between the option pricing method and the scenario-based method:
* Development of scenarios:
* Under the scenario-based method, the valuator defines the possible outcomes as well as the probability of
occurrence.
* Under the option pricing method, the valuator uses a statistical calculation to estimate the full range of
possible outcomes. Typically, the valuator defines the shaPE (or distribution in statistical terms) of the
possible outcomes and the range of changes in value (or standard deviation in statistical terms). The
shaPE of the possible outcomes is assumed to be normally distributed, which is a common assumption
in derivative valuation, as discussed in Module 5. Exhibit 6.3 demonstrates the key statistics concepts
discussed in this SECtion.

* Risk-aversion versus risk-neutral assumption:
Mean
(Management's Best Estimate)
* The scenario-based method assumes a risk-aversion framework in which the investors require a risk
premium to comPEnsate for any additional risks the contingent consideration payments are subject to.
* The option pricing method assumes a risk-neutral framework in which the investors' exPEcted return is risk
free on the contingent consideration payments. The risk-neutral framework is a significant assumption in all
option pricing models, as discussed in Module 5. To apply the risk-neutral framework in valuing contingent
consideration, the valuator will need to adjust management's best estimate to a risk-neutral basis by
discounting the projection at the appropriate rate. The valuator will divide management's projection by the
selected discount rate to arrive at a risk-neutral projection. In selecting the appropriate rate for adjustment,
the valuator will apply the concepts used in building the RMRP as discussed in SECtion 6.1.5.2.
130
06 -- Valuation of Financial Instruments -- Part 3 -- Contingent Consideration and Real Options
The Monte Carlo simulation is a commonly used technique in valuing contingent consideration under the option
pricing method. The valuator defines the distribution and volatility of the underlying metric. The calculation
involves generating a random number that produces an iteration or trial of the possible outcome and a formula
to determine the related payoff of the contingent consideration. Each iteration or trial of the payoffs is averaged
to estimate the exPEcted outcome and discounted at the risk-free rate to arrive at the exPEcted value of the
contingent consideration.
The Black-Scholes formula is an alternative technique in valuing contingent consideration under the option pricing
method. This technique is most commonly used in non-linear payoff structures that include a minimum threshold.
Contingent consideration can be considered a call option on the underlying metric -- the minimum threshold
is the exercise price beyond which the contingent consideration becomes valuable. The Black-Scholes formula
approximates the value of the contingent consideration by estimating the possibilities of it becoming in the money.
Note: Although you should demonstrate an understanding of the option pricing method in valuing contingent
consideration, you will not be asked to PErform a calculation using the appROAch.
6.2 Real Options
6.2.1 Overview of Real Options
Recall that Module 4 of Level I discussed the concept of NPV, which is commonly used as an evaluation tool in
determining whether or not it is economically worthwhile to invest capital into a sPEcific project. The NPV method
creates a static picture of the project by estimating a single profile of the exPEcted future cash flows and the initial
investment costs as of today. The static assumption, however, is not the reality for most managerial decisions.
When presented with a business project, management has several options, such as acting immediately, delaying
until the economics improve, abandoning and realizing its salvage value, and others. Management's flexibility in
deciding its course of action regarding a business project is called the real option. The term real means that it
refers to a tangible asset and not a financial instrument. Put differently, a real option is an economically valuable
right but not an obligation to a company regarding business projects and investment opportunities.
Consider the following example. An oil company acquired the licensing rights to drill in an offshore area
encompassing various reservoIRS and terrains. Management divided the total area into smaller blocks to assess
the best course of action in each block -- some blocks are easy to drill and have positive NPVs, while others are
more difficult to drill and will incur a high initial investment (using current technology) and yield negative NPVs. If
the NPV analysis is the only evaluation tool used, the blocks that have a negative NPV today would be divested.
However, management still has the option to delay until the drilling technology improves, which lowers the cost
of drilling in those blocks. At this point, the economics or NPV will become positive. The thinking of valuing a
business project as an option to develop is the thinking of real options. In other words, management is applying
the notion of options conceived in the financial market to their business situation.
In addition to the cost of drilling, future oil prices can also impact the NPV analysis as of today. If oil prices go up,
the NPV will go up for all the blocks, potentially bringing the NPV of difficult blocks positive. That is, there are
uncertainties associated with the exPEcted future cash flows and the initial investments that can significantly alter
management's decisions. The uncertainties are not factored into the NPV analysis.
A real options analysis can be used as a strategic tool in assessing business situations where there are significant
uncertainties in assumptions and various flexibilities in management decisions. The techniques used in valuing
options in financial markets can be adopted to help management evaluate a business situation. SPEcifically, the
Black-Scholes formula is used to evaluate real options as a way of strategic thinking, discussed in SECtion 6.2.3.
6.2.2 Examples of Real Options
The following are some examples of real options:
131
06 -- Valuation of Financial Instruments -- Part 3 -- Contingent Consideration and Real Options
* Option to delay, which is the option of deferring the business decision to the future (for example, an oil
company delays drilling on certain blocks until new drilling and production technologies yield higher
recoverable reserves and lower initial investment costs);
* Option to expand, which is the option to make an investment or undertake a project in the future to expand
the business oPErations (for example, an oil company expands its capacity in PEtroleum refining in a strategic
geographic area);
* Option to abandon, which is the option to discontinue a project or an asset in order to realize its salvage value
(for example, an oil company divesting a difficult block to comPEtitors who would purchase for strategic, not
economic, reasons);
* Option to stage, which is the option to make an investment in stages instead of a lump-sum upfront
investment (for example, an oil company may divide the licensed region into small blocks and drill the easy
blocks in the fIRSt stage and the difficult blocks in the SECond stage); and
* Option to switch, which is the option to alter or scale a project at some point in the future if the conditions are
unfavourable and resume it when the conditions are favourable (for example, an oil company can shut down
the oPEration of one of its plants when oil prices are low and resume oPEration when prices are high).
6.2.3 Evaluation of Real Options
To evaluate real options, the same techniques develoPEd to value financial options discussed in Module 5 are used.
SPEcifically, SECtion 6.2.3.1 discusses the use of the Black-Scholes formula in evaluating the option to delay while
considering the uncertainties associated with the exPEcted cash flows. SECtion 6.2.3.3 discusses using the Monte
Carlo simulation method to evaluate other real options when there are uncertainties associated with multiple factors.
6.2.3.1 The Analogy Between Real Options and Financial Options -- Application of the Black-Scholes-Merton
Formula

5 The Black-Scholes-Merton formula is a modification of the Black-Scholes formula introduced in Module 5. The Black-Scholes formula
assumes the underlying stock pays no dividend, whereas the Black-Scholes-Merton formula takes into account the impact of
dividends and assumes a constant continuous dividend yield.

t = the remaining term to maturity (in years)
s = the annualized volatility of the underlying
To draw an analogy between real options and financial options, the six key inputs into the Black-Scholes-Merton
formula are compared, as follows:
* St -- The equivalent in a real option is the present value of exPEcted cash flows from the business project;
* q -- The equivalent in a real option is the value that drains away over the duration of the option, such as the
maintenance costs associated with the oilfield;
* X -- The equivalent in a real option is the present value of all the initial costs exPEcted over the lifetime of the
investment opportunity;
* s -- The equivalent in a real option is the uncertainty in cash flows associated with the asset;
* t -- The equivalent in a real option is the PEriod for which the investment opportunity is valid. The length of
the PEriod dePEnds on technology (a product's life cycle), comPEtitive advantage (intensity of comPEtition),
and contracts (patents, leases, licences); and
* r -- The risk-free rate, which is the same in real options and financial options.
Each of the six key inputs can be thought of as levers that impact the value of a real option. An increase in certain
levers will raise the real option value, and vice versa. Exhibit 6.4 compares the six levers of real options to those of
financial options.

6.2.3.2 Real Options Thinking
Real options are important in strategic analysis because traditional evaluation tools such as NPV analysis ignore
the value of flexibility. Consider the oil company example again as discussed in SECtion 6.2.1 and focus on the
uncertainty associated with future oil prices. Evaluating this opportunity under the NPV framework includes
estimating the exPEcted future cash flows and the initial investment costs. Say the block is exPEcted to yield
50 million barrels of oil once develoPEd, the current price of a barrel of oil is $10, and the present value of the
development cost is $600 million. Using an NPV analysis, the economic value of the block is simply:
133
06 -- Valuation of Financial Instruments -- Part 3 -- Contingent Consideration and Real Options
$500 million - $600 million = -$100 million
The NPV analysis suggests that the company forgo the opportunity.
Now consider evaluating this opportunity as an option. Acquiring the licensing fee to drill (buying an option) gives
the company the right to invest (at the exercise price) after uncertainty over the value of the develoPEd reserves
(stock price) is resolved. To begin with, such an evaluation recognizes the importance of uncertainty, which the NPV
analysis assumed away. The uncertainties stem from the quantity of oil that would be produced once drilled and the
oil prices at that point. The quantity of oil can be estimated based on geological studies and historical exploration
data. The volatility of oil prices can also be estimated based on historical trading prices and traded futures prices.
For simplicity, assume that these two sources of uncertainty jointly result in a 30% uncertainty in the exPEcted
cash flows. Holding the option also incurs an annual fixed cost of $15 million to keep the reserve active. This
represents a dividend-like payout of 3% ($15 million / $500 million). Assume the licensing right expires in five years
and the risk-free rate is 5%. Using the Black-Scholes-Merton formula, the real option value is estimated to be:
Ct = St x e-qt x N(d1) -- Xe-rt x N(d2)
Real option value = 500 x e--0.03x5 x 0.58--500e--0.05x5 x 0.32 = + $100 million
The real options analysis suggests the block could yield positive economic NPV if the variability in future oil
prices is considered. The value of real options stems from the flexibility inherent in not having to decide on full
investment today but instead being able to wait and invest when the uncertainty is resolved.
One of the advantages of adopting real options thinking in evaluating a business situation is that it highlights the
key levers that a company can manage pROActively to maximize option value. To illustrate the impact of each of
the six levers, a sensitivity analysis was PErformed by applying a 10% improvement in each lever, and the resulting
change in real option value was calculated, as shown in Exhibit 6.5.

That is, the most sensitive levers are increasing the present value of exPEcted cash flows and reducing the present
value of initial costs. The means to pull these levers are applying new technology to obtain more reliable profiles
of an oilfield's value, better total oil recovery, and more efficient production facilities. The next most sensitive lever
is increasing uncertainty or oil price volatility, but management cannot influence oil prices. At the less sensitive
end of the sPEctrum, the option's duration should be managed to trade off potential improvements in cash flows
against the cost of holding the option in the form of losing "dividend."
6.2.3.3 Application of the Monte Carlo Simulation Method
While the Black-Scholes-Merton formula is a relatively simple evaluation method, it makes restrictive assumptions,
such as a normal distribution of asset values and the constancy of dividends, volatility, and interest rates. These
assumptions may not be valid for real-world complications. In this case, the Monte Carlo simulation is a more
appropriate method, because it considers multi-factor uncertainties, such as the uncertainties in initial costs and
variability in growth rates of the exPEcted cash flows.
Note: Although you should demonstrate an understanding of the Monte Carlo simulation method in valuing real
options, you will not be asked to PErform a calculation using the appROAch.
6.2.4 Criticisms of Real Options Thinking
Real options thinking presents an alternative framework that considers the impact of uncertainties and
management flexibility in handling a business situation. Critics of real options thinking point to the heavy reliance
on subjective inputs that are difficult to measure, such as the uncertainty or volatility of the exPEcted cash flows.
This often results in management taking on more risky business projects that would otherwise be rejected under
the conventional NPV analysis.
Successful application of real options thinking steers management toward maximizing opportunity while minimizing
obligation, encouraging management to think of every situation as an initial investment against future possibilities.

ApPEndix 6A: Consideration of Synergies
Recall from Level I that fair value is a financial reporting concept. Despite the nuances between the definitions of
fair market value and fair value, it is generally accepted that the application of fair value in a financial reporting
setting is bROAdly consistent with the definition of fair market value.
Fair market value is defined as the "highest price" that considers all potential sPEcial interest purchasers. Usually,
it is only in negotiation that potential combined value increments can be identified and quantified. Contingent
consideration is an example in which such value increments are identified and quantified by sPEcial interest purchasers.
Fair market value also takes on a market participant's view. In the context of contingent consideration, the
valuation takes on the PErsPEctive of a market participant in a hypothetical sale or transfer of a contingent
consideration asset (or liability) on a stand-alone basis after the transaction.
A sPEcial interest purchaser negotiates the terms of contingent consideration to capture the potential synergies.
As such, a market participant would consider all relevant post-combination synergies, including those sPEcific to
the acquirer. Any payments ultimately due will reflect the contractual terms of the contingent consideration and
buyer-linked characteristics that are implicit in the contract. As such, all synergies relevant to calculating the payoff
are generally included in the financial projections for the contingent consideration valuation.

MODULE 07
VALUATION OF
SPECIFIC SHARE
CLASSES
Module Overview
Welcome to Module 7. In previous levels and modules, you learned how to value the total equity of a business. This
module explores issues encountered by valuators in the allocation of the total value of a firm's equity to sPEcific
share classes or shareholdings.
By the end of this module, you will be able to:
* PErform professional and technically correct calculations with resPEct to the allocation of value, under both a
direct and indirect appROAch, and assess the reasonability of such calculations; and
* Discuss the differences between different classes of common and preferred shares, including rights and
characteristics, and appROAches to value.

7.1 Allocation of Equity Value
When valuing the common shares of a company that has issued other classes of shares, the valuator fIRSt
determines 100% of the equity value (across all share classes) and then deducts the value attributed to other
classes of shares (i.e., preferred shares) to determine the residual value attributable to the common shares.
A simple example is shown in Example 7.1.
Example 7.1: Value Determination of Common Shares
ABC Corp. acquired the assets of DEF Corp. at an enterprise value of $715 million. As part of the transaction, ABC
assumed the interest-bearing debt of $200 million and the Class A and Class B sPEcial shares valued at $50 million
and $75 million, resPEctively.
The value of the common shares is $390 million, calculated as follows:
Enterprise value
Less: Interest-bearing debt
Equity value (across all share classes)
Allocated to:
Class A sPEcial shares
Class B sPEcial shares
Residual allocated to common shares
715
(200)
515
50
75
390
Dividing the value allocated to each share class by the number of outstanding shares in each class results in
the ratable or pro rata value of each share. In this exhibit, the total value of the common shares is $390 million.
If a shareholder owned 25% of the common shares, the pro rata value of their shares would be $97.5 million
($390 million x 25%).
Where only a partial interest in a business is to be valued, it is generally not sufficient to calculate the pro rata
value. Pro rata or ratable value generally refers to share values before any discounts or premiums applicable to the
sPEcific shareholding being valued. The valuator may need to consider additional factors when valuing interests in
classes of shares, including the various rights and characteristics of each class, relationships among shareholders,
and the ranking of each class for dividends and repayments of capital.
7.1.1 Indirect and Direct AppROAches to Valuing Shares
When valuing individual shares or share classes, the valuator should consider the following basic appROAches:
* The indirect appROAch involves allocating the en bloc value to the various share classes on a pro rata basis, and
making adjustments to this value for various features attached to the shares and for other considerations; and
* The direct appROAch involves valuing the shares or share class based on the present value of the future cash
flows accruing to the shareholder.
A valuator should consider both appROAches and be able to reconcile the differences between the resulting
conclusions under each appROAch.
7.1.2 Other Classes of Debt and Equity
Common shares typically rank behind preferred shares, or other sPEcial shares, with resPEct to the receipt of
dividends and/or repayments of capital. To generate capital, a company may issue various forms of debt and
equity with sPEcial features to increase their attractiveness to a potential investor.

7.2 Preferred Shares

Restricted Shares
A preferred share is a class of share capital that entitles the holder to preferred features, such as a stated dollar
value PEr share at redemption or a preferred dividend ranking above that of the company's common shares. While
preferred shareholders may be giving up some of the potential residual value and growth accruing to common
shares, they receive protection from the downside risk through the sPEcial features attached to their shares.1
Preferred shares have similarities to bonds or debt of a company, as they often receive a fixed dividend (similar to
bonds or debt receiving fixed income payments) and rank higher than the common shares (as do bonds or debt).
However, payments to preferred shareholders (either dividend payments or redemption of shares) are typically
paid after all obligations to debtholders have been met, so despite these similarities, preferred shares are generally
inferior to the debt obligations of a company in a firm's overall capital structure. Exhibit 7.2 provides a summary of
some of these differences.2

7.3 Situations Involving Multiple Classes of Common and Preferred
Shares
Under Canadian statutes, it is possible to create multiple classes of common and preferred shares and to
assign complex and unique characteristics to each class. In private closely held companies, preferred shares are
frequently referred to as "sPEcial shares." For the purposes of this discussion, the terms "preferred shares" and
"sPEcial shares" are used interchangeably.
SPEcial shares are often created in family-controlled companies with the objective of income splitting and estate
freezing. These shares generally reflect unique family and PErsonal relationships, which tend to reduce the likelihood
that a third party would purchase, or be given the opportunity to purchase, such shares. Private equity firms often
acquire preferred/sPEcial shares with a similar objective of maintaining a certain level of control in their investment.
Shareholders who are all related can use several strategies to either prevent existing owners from selling their
shares or prevent external parties from buying shares. For example, shares of a certain class that can only be
sold for a prescribed nominal amount might dissuade existing shareholders from selling their shares. Requiring a
unanimous vote of all shareholders for shares of a certain class might limit or prevent external parties from buying
into said share class.
To effect a sale, either the family, or a third-party purchaser, may insist on changes to certain characteristics of a
certain class of shares (e.g., features relating to voting or dividends).
Founders, or their descendants, commonly hold a sPEcial class of shares that include additional voting power. These
shares typically provide the holder with almost total control of the company. Two-tiered share classes are encountered
in many industries and consist of voting and non-voting classes of shares. Two-tiered voting classes can arise where
a family-owned business has recently become public and is undergoing a transition from private to full public
ownership. The founder is able to retain control of the company while the public can obtain an equity ownership.
Some critics have argued that the two-tiered structure thwarts shareholder democracy while also depressing stock
prices, as this particular structure makes it less likely that the company will be acquired. Disgruntled shareholders
have caused a number of companies to consolidate separate classes of shares.
The founders of companies with two-tiered share structures have argued that they have a right to control the
company when they take it public, and shareholders understand those rules when they buy the shares. Many
public companies continue to use the two-tiered structure, as they believe it effectively leads to achieving the
long-term goals of the company and thwarts takeovers.
When valuing non-voting common shares, a discount from the pro rata value (which also typically assumes a pro
rata level of votes) is generally applied. The differences in prices between voting shares and non-voting shares of
publicly traded companies can be used as a benchmark to quantiFY such a discount.
Exhibit 7.3 summarizes the difference in prices of some publicly traded voting and non-voting shares.

As shown in Exhibit 7.3, the quantum of the discount for lack of voting rights that are applied by investors in public
equity markets can vary widely by company. Many factors can impact the size of the non-voting discount implied by
public stock prices, including the size of blocks held by controlling shareholders and the liquidity of trades.
For example, Canadian Tire Corp. Ltd. has a dual class share structure consisting of (1) voting common shares
and (2) Class A non-voting shares. The non-voting shares of Canadian Tire, in aggregate, are entitled to elect the
greater of three directors or one-fifth of the company's directors. At the time of publication, Canadian Tire had
16 directors; accordingly, the non-voting shareholders only had the power to elect three directors (18.75% of the
board of directors).
At the time of publication, Canadian Tire had 3.4 million common shares outstanding and 57.4 million Class A
non-voting shares outstanding. In other words, even though the common shares only account for approximately
5.6% of Canadian Tire's total number of shares outstanding, this class of voting shares is entitled to 100% of the
company's voting power and controls 13 of 16 seats on the board of directors (81.25% of the board of directors).
Moreover, at the time of publication, Canadian Tire's common shares were closely held by a small number of
shareholders. As shown in the table below, two shareholders -- with a family connection -- controlled 61.4% of the
company's common shares, though other blocks of shareholdings could potentially exert some influence.

20.50%
20.60%
12.20%
94.20%
Accordingly, in the case of Canadian Tire, the 41.1% implied discount for the price of Class A non-voting shares
versus voting shares reflects the ownership structure in which the company's common shares are effectively
controlled by only two shareholders (in the event that these two shareholders act in concert). As discussed in
Level II, the composition of the shareholdings of the common shareholders would arguably warrant a relatively
high discount for lack of control -- even for a minority shareholder with voting rights. It is therefore not surprising
that non-voting shares, with a limited influence on the company's board of directors, trade at a significant discount
to voting shares.
142
07 -- Valuation of SPEcific Share Classes
By contrast, Rogers Communications Inc.'s dual class share structure consists of (1) Class A voting shares and
(2) Class B non-voting shares. At the time of publication, voting control was held by Rogers Control Trust;
collectively, the Rogers Control Trust and other holding companies of the Rogers family controlled approximately
98% of the Class A voting shares and approximately 10% of the Class B non-voting shares (or approximately 29%
of all shares outstanding across both classes). Despite the size of this family shareholding, there is a very small
implied discount for lack of voting rights between Rogers' Class A voting shares and Class B non-voting shares
(1.4% PEr Exhibit 7.3). There are several possible explanations for this:
* Regardless of whether a prosPEctive shareholder is interested in Class A voting shares or Class B non-voting
shares of Rogers, there is no exPEctation that their vote will have any real power, given that the Rogers family
controls 98% of the votes. This is in contrast to Canadian Tire, where there is a possibility that a purchaser of
Canadian Tire's common shares could theoretically obtain some meaningful ownership of the voting shares
(since the controlling shareholders of Canadian Tire control approximately 61.4% of the votes, rather than the
98% voting control held by the Rogers family).
* Investors may view the governance structure of the Rogers Control Trust to provide non-voting shareholders
with some level of protection.
* The Class A voting shares of Rogers are highly illiquid. Of approximately 111.1 million Class A voting shares
outstanding, only roughly 2,000 of these shares traded on average, on a daily basis, at the time of publication.
Accordingly, the Class A voting shares presumably suffer from some degree of a discount for illiquidity as
compared to the Class B non-voting shares, which are highly liquid.
7.3.1 Illustration of an OPEn Market Transaction Involving Dual Class Share Structure
In 2007, CHUM Ltd. was acquired by Bell Globemedia Inc. CHUM's voting shares were acquired for $52.50 and
the non-voting shares were acquired for $47.25, implying a 10% non-voting discount. The difference between the
historical trading prices of the two shares was used as a benchmark in establishing the offer prices. Most of the
voting shares were owned by CHUM's founders.
Some minority shareholders owning an interest in the non-voting share class claimed the offer was discriminatory
as they believed the prices of the two classes should be equal in the acquisition. In addition, it was claimed that
the voting shares historically lacked trading volume and the trading prices did not necessarily reflect market value.
These shareholders argued that the historical differences in price between the voting and non-voting shares could
not support the discount of 10% imposed by the offer price.
Conversely, it was argued that the non-voting shares had historically traded at an average of a 15% discount to the
voting shares. In addition, it was claimed unfair that the minority shareholders who bought the lower priced shares
would be able to sell at the higher share price. Further, it was stated that the non-voting shareholders were aware
that CHUM did not have a "coattail provision."
(In the event of a takeover offer for a company, a coattail provision gives the holders of the non-voting or
restricted voting shares the right to convert their shares into an equal number of the suPErior voting shares.)
7.3.2 Characteristics Influencing Value
The value of sPEcial shares dePEnds on the various rights and characteristics attached to them. Attributes that
impact value include:
* The potential of sPEcial shares to participate in the growth of the company (e.g., convertibility and
participation rights). More features generally lead to a higher value;
* The demand and ease with which the shares can be sold. Better liquidity typically indicates a higher value;
* The degree of control the shares allow the shareholder to exercise over the company. More elements of control
typically indicate a higher value;
143
07 -- Valuation of SPEcific Share Classes
* SPEcific rights and characteristics (voting, rank, dividends, conversion rights, etc.). More rights generally lead
to a higher value;
* Ownership structure (number of shareholders and classes of shares owned by the same individuals). Smaller or
fewer ownership groups can lead to a higher value; and
* Dividend history and the likelihood of future dividend declarations. Reliable dividends typically lead to a higher
value for a given class of shares as compared to share classes without such dividend features.
SPEcial features are typically added to these shares to increase their attractiveness on issuance. The following
sPEcial features will influence the value of these shares:
* SPEcial shareholders' ability to vote:
* SPEcific circumstances under which they vote or do not vote;
* Number of votes each share carries; and
* Number of directors they can elect.
* SPEcial shareholders' ability to access proceeds of liquidation:
* Priority; and
* Participation.
* SPEcial shareholders' access to dividends:
* Priority; and
* Cumulative.
* SPEcial shares' ability to convert into common shares.
* SPEcial shares' ability to participate in the firm's earnings.
* SPEcial shares' redemption and retraction features.
Where a company has issued preferred or sPEcial shares, their value must be deducted from the aggregate en bloc
equity value to determine the value of the common shares (assuming no other classes of shares exist).
However, it should be noted that the reported value or par value (also sometimes referred to as liquidation value)
of sPEcial shares on the balance sheet of a company, or their redemption value, may not necessarily be indicative
of their fair market value. Par value is a nominal amount assigned to the shares, generally to calculate dividend
payments.
As mentioned above, the valuator should consider the sPEcific rights and characteristics of these shares, in
addition to other factors.
7.4 Valuation AppROAches for Preferred Shares
Valuation principles state that value: (1) is prosPEctive; and (2) is equivalent to the present value of all future
benefits anticipated to accrue from ownership. As such, the value of a preferred share is based on the anticipated
future cash flows that accrue to the shareholder, discounted by a market-based rate of return or yield.
Valuation models for traditional preferred shares are based on the exPEcted dividends to be received by the
shareholder. Where a fixed dividend is payable at sPEcified intervals on non-retractable, non-redeemable,
cumulative preferred shares, with no other sPEcial features, the value of the preferred shares can be determined
using the dividend discount model, as illustrated in Exhibit 7.4.
144
07 -- Valuation of SPEcific Share Classes
Exhibit 7.4: Dividend Discount Model
Value of preferred shares = D/r
Where:
D = exPEcted constant dividend
r = required rate of return
Similar to the capitalization of earnings appROAch used in valuing businesses, the dividend discount appROAch:
* Assists in estimating the fair market value of preferred shares where there is no active market for the shares; and
* Assumes that a constant dividend amount is payable to the shareholder at prescribed intervals (e.g., quarterly
or annually).
For example, if a cumulative preferred share pays a quarterly dividend of $1 PEr share and an appropriate after-tax
annual rate of return is estimated to be 8%, then the value of each preferred share would be $50 ($4 dividend / 8%
rate of return).
In the event that dividends are exPEcted to grow in the future, the valuator can use a variation of the formula set
out in Exhibit 7.5 (the Gordon growth model).
Exhibit 7.5: Gordon Growth Model
Value of preferred shares = D / (r - g)
Where:
D = exPEcted constant dividend
r = required rate of return
g = exPEcted constant growth rate
Building on the example of a preferred share with a $1 quarterly dividend, if the exPEcted growth rate of the
dividend is 3%, then the value of each preferred share would be $80 [$4 annual dividend / (8% - 3%)].
If the preferred shares are redeemable, their value may be derived from the formula set out in Exhibit 7.6.
Exhibit 7.6: Value of Redeemable Preferred Shares
Value of preferred shares = D / (1 + r)1 + D / (1 + r)2 ... Dn + P / (1 + r)n
Where:
D = exPEcted dividend for each PEriod
P = proceeds received when sold or redeemed
r = required rate of return
n = number of PEriods until sale or redemption
Example 7.2: Valuation of Redeemable SPEcial Shares
Emica has inherited sPEcial shares of Aqua-Glass Recyclers Ltd., a family-owned aquarium and sPEcialty glass
recycling business. The sPEcial shares have a total par value of $1 million and an annual dividend of 3%. These
shares are redeemable at the option of the holder in 3 years.
145
07 -- Valuation of SPEcific Share Classes
Emica has the following choice:
* To respond to the redemption call in three years for $1 million; or
* To hold them for an indefinite PEriod of time.
If the required annual rate of return for this investment is 4%, what is Emica's optimal choice, assuming a
redemption call will be made in three years?
Solution:
As calculated below, the optimal choice for Emica is the one that will yield her the highest present value of cash flows:
Option 1: Sell shares in three years
* Annual dividends: 3% x $1 million par value = $30,000
* Present value of cash flows = [(30,000) / (1 + 0.04)] + [(30,000) / (1 + 0.04)2] + [(30,000 + 1,000,000) /
(1 + 0.04)3] = $972,249
Option 2: Keep shares indefinitely
* Annual dividends: 3% x $1 million par value = $30,000
* Present value of cash flows = 30,000/0.04 = $750,000
As illustrated above, Emica would be better off accepting a redemption call in three years than holding the shares
indefinitely. Note that if there was a small growth rate assumed for the exPEcted dividend stream, the indefinite
hold scenario could be more valuable. For example, if the annual dividend is exPEcted to grow at 1% PEr year, the
present value of cash flows under Option 2 would increase to $1 million:
[$30,000 / (0.04 - 0.01)] = $1,000,000
7.4.1 Rate of Return
The required rate of return on preferred share dividends must accurately reflect the risks of receiving dividends
and the exPEcted PErformance on other terms of the shares (such as redemption likelihoods or the ability to
answer a retraction call). The valuator should consider the following factors when assessing a reasonable rate of
return for preferred shares:
* Cumulative dividends versus non-cumulative dividends;
* Priority of dividends/capital against other share classes;
* Company's financial stability and cash flow needs;
* Company's earnings and asset coverage;
* Voting or conditional voting rights;
* Comparable dividend yields and payout ratios for similar investments; and
* Risk-free interest rates.
These considerations are discussed in the following SECtion.
7.4.2 Cumulative Dividends
In the context of preferred shares with a sPEcific dividend rate (which must still be declared before it can be
paid), the term "cumulative" means that a company is contractually obligated to make up for any missed dividend
payments -- dividends in arrears -- before declaring or paying dividends to any other subordinated class of shares
such as common shares. The cumulative feature reduces the risk of non-payment, preserves the exPEcted future
cash flow stream to the shareholder, and accordingly increases value, all else being equal.
146
07 -- Valuation of SPEcific Share Classes
If dividends on preferred shares are in arrears, they should be discounted to present value -- based on the
exPEcted time of payment -- and added to the value of the preferred shares.
The valuator should deduct any dividends in arrears before allocating value to a class of shares ranking below.
7.4.3 Non-Cumulative Dividends
Non-cumulative dividends have a greater risk associated with the receipt of future cash flows and will therefore
command a higher yield or capitalization rate as compared to shares with a cumulative dividend feature. The
valuator should review the company's dividend history in assessing the likelihood of future dividends. Although
past history does not necessarily guarantee future dividends, it provides an indication of the likelihood that
dividends will be declared in the future. The valuator can also consider forecasts of future cash flows, indications
of growth and related capital asset acquisitions, and other factors that could give an indication as to a company's
ability and likelihood to pay dividends going forward.
7.4.4 Priority of Dividends/Capital
The ability of a share class to receive dividends in priority to another class increases its value; it reduces the risk
of not receiving dividends or having dividends deferred if the company's cash flows decrease. In addition, upon
the liquidation or sale of the company, share classes that receive their portion of capital fIRSt will be less risky than
share classes that receive their portion of capital last (i.e., typically common shares receive the residual cash flows
and capital once all creditors and other share classes have been paid).
7.4.5 Company's Financial Stability and Cash Flow Needs
The financial stability and cash flow needs of the company should be assessed as these factors relate to its ability
to generate income and pay dividends in the future. If the company is having difficulty meeting its debt obligations
or requires retained earnings to finance capital projects, it is less likely to declare or pay dividends in the near
future. In addition to the company's financial status, the valuator should also assess the general risk of the business
(industry, size, market share, comPEtitors, etc.) and dividend yields and payout ratios of companies in similar
industries.
7.4.6 Company's Earnings and Asset Coverage
The funds or cash flows available for distribution in a liquidation scenario should be assessed. If, on analysis, there
apPEars to be sufficient funds to repay the redemption value of a preferred share class, the downside risk on the
investment (and conversely, the rate of return) is reduced.
There are various ratios that can be used to assess earnings coverage and asset coverage in a company as shown
in Exhibit 7.7 and Exhibit 7.8.
The earnings coverage ratio relates to the adequacy of the company's earnings to pay dividends on preferred
shares and interest on debt obligations. The higher the ratio, the lower the risk associated with dividend payments.
Exhibit 7.7: Assessing Earnings Coverage
Earnings Coverage Ratio
Fixed charge coverage = EBIT / [I + D / (1 - t)]
Where:
EBIT = earnings before interest and taxes
D = preferred dividend
147
07 -- Valuation of SPEcific Share Classes
I = interest exPEnse
t = effective income tax rate
As dividends are paid from after-tax income, the dividend is grossed up to represent pre-tax income so it is
comparable with EBIT.
Exhibit 7.8: Assessing Asset Coverage
Asset Coverage Ratio
Asset coverage = [MVA - MVD] / L
Where:
MVA = market value of assets
MVD = market value of debt
L = liquidation value of preferred shares
For the asset coverage ratio, assuming there are no other classes of shares that rank higher than the preferred
shares, a ratio greater than 1.0 indicates that there is enough capital in the company to pay the redemption value
of the shares. A ratio lower than 1.0 indicates that the company does not have enough coverage to fully redeem the
preferred shares in the event of a liquidation, which would increase the risk associated with the shares. The closer
the ratio is to 1.0, the higher proportion of redemption value that would be received by the preferred shareholders.
There could also be additional costs in the event of a liquidation, which would further reduce distributable cash
to the preferred shareholders (i.e., taxes on disposition, sales commissions, severance, etc.). These should be
considered in the MVA portion of the above formula if a liquidation scenario is likely.
In the event of a liquidation of the company, preferred shares rank below debt and above common shares. The
capital structure of the company can also be used to assess the protection afforded to the preferred shareholders.
A high debt to equity ratio puts preferred shareholders at greater risk, as there is less protection for these shares
when a company exPEriences a reduction in cash flow.
7.4.7 Voting or Conditional Voting
Some preferred shares may receive voting rights or conditional voting rights when dividends are in arrears. This
provides two main benefits to the preferred shareholder:
* A right to participate, to some extent, in determining the direction of the company; and
* An incentive for the board of directors to declare dividends to avoid giving away control.
Voting or conditional voting rights can reduce the uncertainty regarding repayment and increase the value of the
preferred shares.
7.4.8 Comparable Dividend Yields and Payout Ratios
The dividend yield paid by comparable publicly traded companies, whose shares carry similar rights and
characteristics, may be considered as reference points in the valuation of private shares of a subject company.
However, the valuator should be careful in using publicly traded SECurities as benchmarks, as directly comparable
SECurities are seldom found. The valuator will have to adjust for the differences between the two issues. The
differences between public and private preferred shares will be discussed later in this module.

Example 7.3: Considerations in Valuing Preferred Shares
Rodeo Corp. manufactures electronic components for household appliances. Recently, the industry has slowed
down and the company has needed to fund cash flows by issuing additional SECurities. Rodeo has issued
$25 million par value of preferred shares with non-cumulative dividends of 2% PEr year. These shares have fIRSt
priority in dividends and capital of all other share classes. The company has been sporadic in paying dividends
over the past five years and will not be able to pay dividends in the current year due to a lack of liquidity.
The following data exists for Rodeo:
* Revenues are $75 million;
* Trailing 12-month EBIT is $9 million;
* Total market value of debt is $100 million at an interest rate of 7.5%;
* Estimated market value of assets is $120 million; and
* Tax rate is 35%.
Required:
How would you classiFY the risk of the preferred shares based on the following criteria?
* Dividends (cumulative versus non-cumulative);
* Priority of dividends;
* Financial health of Rodeo;
* Earnings coverage;
* Asset coverage; and
* Voting rights.

Criteria
Risk
Explanation
Asset coverage
High
Asset coverage = ($120 million - $100 million)/$25 million = 0.8
Coverage is less than 1.0, which indicates that the net equity of
the company is not sufficient to cover the liquidation value of the
preferred shares.
Voting
Medium
As the shares are non-voting, they do not have any control over the
direction of the company.
Solution:
Given the troubled state of the industry, and the poor financial position and prosPEcts of the company, among
the other factors indicated above, the risk profile of the preferred shares would rank medium to high. The valuator
should consider all of the key features of a preferred share, including the status of the company and industry, in
assessing the risk and corresponding valuation of the shares.
7.5 Rights and Characteristics of SPEcial (Preferred) Shares
In addition to assessing the quantum and likelihood of future dividends, the valuator should consider other sPEcial
features attached to the subject shares that provide the shareholder with various rights and/or disadvantages that,
in turn, influence value. The following are some of the common features:
* Redemption features;
* Retraction features;
* Voting or non-voting rights;
* Participating or non-participating;
* Escrowed;
* Convertible; and
* Rank.
These are discussed in the next SECtion.
7.5.1 Redemption
A redemption right is an embedded derivative that can be acted on by the issuer when market conditions make
it advantageous for the company to redeem a class of preferred shares (i.e., when refinancing at a lower cost is
advantageous). To comPEnsate for this risk, the purchaser of a redeemable preferred share can demand a higher
dividend rate.
Where preferred shares are redeemable at the issuer's option at any given point in time, the redemption price,
plus any dividends in arrears, generally sets a ceiling on the value of the preferred shares. That is, a buyer would
not pay more for a preferred share than the amount it could be redeemed for, even if the present value of future
dividends was higher.
If the sPEcial shares are only redeemable at the option of the company's directors, but are held by PErsons who
control the company, they may be treated as debt and valued at their redemption value. However, if the holders of
sPEcial shares do not control the company, then it will be necessary to consider all other relevant factors, including
the following:
* SECurity and certainty of dividend;
* Yield on sPEcial shares in relation to comparable publicly traded SECurities;
150
07 -- Valuation of SPEcific Share Classes
* Amount of real equity (i.e., availability of funds) in the company to redeem the shares;
* Likelihood of redemption; and
* Liquidity of shares.
Where the company's equity does not exceed the stated redemption price of the shares, a discount to the
redemption price may be appropriate in quantiFYing the value of the preferred shares.
7.5.2 Retraction
Where the sPEcial shares are retractable at the option of the holder, they would typically be valued at their
retractable value, plus any dividends in arrears. (Note: This might not be the case where the normal valuation method
results in a higher value. That is, a shareholder would not retract if the present value of future dividends was greater
than the retraction value.) A valuator should also consider the availability of funds in the company to meet retraction
obligations. In addition to any other features of the sPEcial shares, the valuator should also consider whether the
retraction right vests at a future date. If the retraction right does not vest, a discount might be appropriate.
7.5.3 Voting or Non-Voting
SPEcial shares can have voting rights equivalent to that of common shares. Non-voting sPEcial shares can have
features that give them voting rights if certain triggering events occur, such as dividends in arrears that are not
paid within a sPEcified PEriod of time. If voting sPEcial shares can exercise control over the company, then it might
be argued that they should be valued in excess of their redemption value.
Note: A suPEr-voting share is a share that gives the holder increased voting rights. SuPEr-voting shares allow a
limited number of shareholders to control a company without owning more than 50% of the ordinary shares.
Where a shareholder owns both common shares and voting sPEcial shares -- which, in combination, provide
control of the company -- it would be mutually advantageous to the shareholder and the purchaser to acquire the
shares in tandem, thereby maintaining voting control. The value of each class of shares in a separate transaction
might be worth significantly less, as each would represent a minority position.
7.5.3.1 Discounts for Non-Voting Shares
As described earlier in this module and as shown in Exhibit 7.2, empirical data exists that suggests that investors in
public companies may ascribe a discount attributable to a lack of voting rights in cases where a company has both
voting and non-voting common shares.
Similarly, in instances where a subject company has multiple classes of sPEcial shares, sPEcial shares with voting
rights might warrant a premium to similar sPEcial shares without such voting rights, all other factors being equal.
7.5.4 Participation
Holders of participating preferred shares are entitled to receive payments over their stipulated amounts, either
through dividends and/or the repayment of capital. The valuation of participating preferred shares is similar to
valuing common shares in that they share in the growth of the company.
In some cases, based on the existence of constraints on the common shares, a fully participating preferred share
will share equally with the common shareholders in any residual earnings after the dividends to the common
shares have been paid.
The value of participating preferred shares is derived from the right to receive higher dividends and the likelihood
of future payments. When assessing the value of these shares, the valuator should consider:
* The history of participating preferred and common share dividend payments;
151
07 -- Valuation of SPEcific Share Classes
* OPErating projections of the issuer, including prosPEctive cash reinvestment requirements and discretionary
cash flows;
* Participating preferred and common share ownership PErcentages. Where the common shares and
participating preferred shares are held by the same PErson(s), there is generally a greater likelihood of
participating dividend payments; and
* Other features attaching to the participating preferred shares, such as redemption, retraction, and conversion
rights that might encourage or discourage a company's board of directors from declaring common share
dividends that give rise to participation rights.
In theory, in the ABSence of any form of distribution priority, the value of a participating share is never less than a
similar non-participating share.
One appROAch to valuing participating sPEcial shares is to value the participating and non- participating elements
separately (that is, value the participating and non-participating dividends separately). The yield associated with
the non-participating dividend should be lower than the participating dividend to reflect the different risks in
non-payment. The valuator should also keep in mind that while valuing the participation right in isolation, the
shareholder does receive a benefit from the fixed non-participating dividend, thus reducing the overall risk in the
SECurity.
Another methodology for valuing participating SECurities is to value both dividend streams together, and to
adjust the yield to account for the additional risk in non-payment of the participating shares. In either appROAch,
estimating an appropriate yield for a participating sPEcial share can be extremely subjective. In assessing an
appropriate yield, the valuator should be aware of any other features attached to participating shares.
Example 7.4: Valuation of Preferred Shares
Ralph Corp. has issued $10 million in participating preferred shares that have an annual dividend of 5%. There are
1,000 preferred shares and 25,000 common shares. The equity of the company has been valued at $25 million.

FIRSt calculate the redemption value of the preferred share, which is the value of a traditional preferred share before
the participation feature. To value the participation feature, determine the amount available after redeeming the
preferred shares ($15 million) divided by all participating shares (26,000, including preferred and common shares).
152
07 -- Valuation of SPEcific Share Classes
7.5.5 Escrowed Shares
Escrowed shares, while entitled to vote and receive dividends, may not be purchased or sold for a prescribed PEriod
of time unless sPEcial approval is obtained. This restriction represents a disadvantage to the shareholder in terms of
liquidity and, dePEnding on the length of the time restriction, the value of the shares could be significantly eroded.
In valuing escrowed shares, the valuator should consider the following:
* The value of similar non-escrowed shares. This will provide an upPEr limit on the value of the escrowed shares;
* The restriction PEriod. The shorter the restriction PEriod, the smaller the discount;
* Whether the escrowed shares can be sold/purchased under a private agreement; and
* The conditions that must be satisfied to release the escrowed shares.
Escrowed shares are often encountered in discussions around restricted share discounts and discounts for lack of
marketability.
A restricted share discount is a discount that arises from the inability of a shareholder to liquidate or transfer its
shares.
Generally sPEaking, there are two ways to determine a restricted share discount. The indirect method relies on
empirical studies that measure the quantum of a restricted share discount by measuring discounts observed in
shares that are subject to restrictions typically associated with restrictions on initial public offerings imposed by the
U.S. SECurities Exchange Commission and articulated in the SEC's Rule 144 Selling Restricted and Control SECurities.
The direct method estimates the discount through measurement typically through option analysis such as a
put-call parity analysis or a binomial model analysis. Put-call parity and the binomial model were introduced in
Module 5.
7.5.5.1 The Indirect Method -- Restricted Stock Studies
Rule 144 of the U.S. SEC defines restricted SECurities as SECurities that have been acquired in unregistered, private
sales from the issuer or from an affiliate of the issuer. Investors typically receive restricted SECurities through
private placement offerings, employee stock benefit plans, as comPEnsation for professional services, or in
exchange for providing "seed money" or start-up capital to the issuing company. The restrictions imposed by Rule
144 have the effect of reducing the fair market value of the restricted stock in comparison to free-trading shares.
A number of empirical studies conducted since the late 1960s have attempted to quantiFY the discount attributable
to restricted stock. James A. Debresser, writing in the Business Valuation Digest,4 provides an excellent summary
of several major studies conducted before 1999. These studies support the traditional rule of thumb for restricted
stock discounts in a range of 25% to 40%. However, as Debresser points out, this rule of thumb is based on average
results. Actual discounts exPErienced ranged as high as 91% and as low as negative 30% (i.e., a premium was paid
to acquire the block of restricted stock).
The 1969 SEC Institutional Investor Study on restricted stock provides guidance as to the size of the restricted
stock discount for a particular transaction. The key findings were as follows:
* The larger the dollar value of the transaction, the smaller the restricted stock discount encountered;
* The larger the revenues of a company, the smaller the restricted stock discount encountered;
* Companies with higher levels of earnings tended to have smaller discounts associated with them; and
4 Debresser, James A. "Valuing Restricted Stock." Business Valuation Digest, Vol. 5, No. 2 (1999): 1-8.
153
07 -- Valuation of SPEcific Share Classes
* Companies that traded on the New York Stock Exchange and American Stock Exchange tended to have
smaller discounts associated with them than companies whose shares traded on over-the-counter exchanges,
which had a larger discount associated with them.
Some of the SEC's findings were confirmed in a subsequent study carried out by Bruce A. Johnson, ASA, and
published in the Business Valuation Review.5
In a December 2003 issue of the Business Valuation Review,6 Ashok B. Abbott, PhD, notes another statistically
relevant factor: the turnover of shares in the stock market. The greater the turnover, the more rapidly a block of
shares can be sold into the marketplace without depressing price.
It should be noted that the studies summarized by Debresser were conducted before the SEC reduced the hold
PEriod in 1997, from two years to one. However, the dribble-out rule remains. Under the dribble-out rule, the total
amount of SECurities sold in any three-month PEriod cannot exceed more than 1% of the total number of the
company's outstanding shares or the average weekly reported trading volume during the four weeks preceding
such sale.
A 2004 article by Shannon Pratt, FASA, MCBA, CFA, in the Business Valuation Review,7 notes that there are
actually two factors that contribute to a restricted stock discount. FIRSt, a marketability discount applies during the
holding PEriod. SECond, a blockage discount8 applies during the dribble-out PEriod.
Pratt also notes that "...the larger the block of shares outstanding, the smaller the pool of potential buyers. For
the foregoing reasons, restricted stock transactions consisting of the largest blocks as a PErcentage of shares
outstanding have by far the largest discounts." He further notes that "the PErceived holding PEriod (which takes
into account the 'dribble-out' PEriod) is one of the major determinants of the magnitude of the discount for lack of
marketability."
Note: There are countless academic paPErs concerned with the topic of restricted share discounts. If you are
interested in this area, you are encouraged to search "discounts for lack of marketability" online.
7.5.5.2 The Direct Method -- Put-Call Parity Analysis
The quantum of restricted share discount can also be estimated using a put-call parity analysis. To PErform this
analysis, the Black-Scholes formula is used to estimate the notional value of a call option and a put option at the
given valuation date. The use of put-call parity analysis was discussed in further detail in Module 5.
7.5.6 Convertible Preferred Shares
Some SECurities can PErmit the holder to convert their shares into other classes of shares (typically common
shares). Where preferred shares are convertible into common shares, the provisions of the conversion feature must
be carefully considered.
7.5.6.1 Conversion at Any Time at the Option of the Holder
Where preferred shares are convertible at any time at the option of the holder, they are valued at the greater of
their conversion value and their value based on other features including redemption and retraction value and
dividend yield.

without undue pressure on the market price of the stock.
154
07 -- Valuation of SPEcific Share Classes
Where conversion value is higher, no reduction in the en bloc equity value of the business is made in resPEct of
the convertible preferred shares. The convertible preferred shares are assumed to be converted and, assuming no
other class of shares outstanding, the entire equity value accrues to the notionally outstanding common shares
(calculated on an as-converted basis). This results in a decline in the ratable value of the pre-conversion common
shares.
Conversely, where the value of the convertible preferred shares (based on their features) is higher than conversion
value -- that is, the holder will not convert to common shares -- the value determined for the preferred shares is
deducted from the en bloc equity value and the pre-conversion common shares do not suffer dilution.
7.5.6.2 Conversion at Any Time at the Option of the Issuer
Where preferred shares are convertible at any time at the option of the issuer, they are valued at the lower of:
(1) their conversion value; and (2) their value based on other features.
Where the preferred shares' conversion value is lower than their value based on other features, the preferred
shares are assumed to be converted and, assuming no other class of shares outstanding, the entire equity value
accrues to the notionally outstanding common shares.
Where the preferred share value based on other features is lower than the conversion value, the value of the
preferred shares is deducted from the aggregate en bloc equity value accruing to the undiluted outstanding
common shares.
Example 7.5: Ross Conversion Inc.
Ross Conversion Inc. has issued two SECurities: 30,000 preferred shares convertible into 30,000 common shares
at a conversion price of $2.00 PEr share, and 500,000 common shares. A valuation for the company has recently
been completed, which indicated that the total en bloc equity value of the company (across both share classes) is
$1,560,000.
Required:
The preferred shareholders want to know whether they should convert their holdings into common shares.
Solution:
As shown below, if the preferred shareholders converted their shares into common shares, the total number of
shares outstanding would be 530,000. Based on a total equity value of $1,560,000, each of the 530,000 shares
would be worth $2.94 on an as-converted basis.

As demonstrated above, the preferred shareholders are better off converting as the value of their shares increases
from $2.00 PEr share to $2.94 PEr share.
The terms of the conversion indicate the rate of conversion, the time PEriod under which the conversion can occur,
and the tyPEs of shares that will be received in exchange.
Conversion rights are similar to a call option. An investor will normally accept a lower dividend rate for the
conversion right and, upon issuance, the conversion price of the sPEcial shares will often be higher than the value
upon conversion (i.e., the shares will be issued out of the money).
The value of convertible preferred shares is a function of the value of the preferred share, excluding the conversion
right, in comparison to the value of the shares if converted. The highest value under both considerations would
normally be deemed as the fair market value of the convertible preferred shares, assuming there were no restrictions
on conversion. In essence, the value of a convertible preferred share is the value of the straight preferred share plus the
value of the option to convert. (This is similar to the concept of convertible debt, which were explored in Module 4.)
Another way of viewing this scenario is to consider the value of the conversion option as just that -- an option on
common shares at a conversion price that could be valued using an option pricing formula, combined with a value
of the preferred/sPEcial share as a straight yield instrument.
7.5.6.3 Convertible at Option of Shareholder
Example 7.6: Kelly Conversion Corp.
Kelly Conversion Corp. has issued two SECurities: 150,000 preferred shares convertible into common shares at a
1:1 ratio and 500,000 common shares recently valued at $40 PEr share (pre-conversion value). The convertible
preferred shares have a redemption value of $5 million.
Required:
The preferred shareholders have the conversion right and want to know whether they should convert their
holdings into common shares.
Solution:
The table below illustrates that where shares are convertible and retractable at any time at the option of the
holder, the value of the shares is the greater of their converted value and their non-converted value. As shown
below, the $5.8 million converted value is greater than the $5.0 million redemption value.
When the conversion value is greater, the other equity holders will exPErience a dilutive effect on the pro rata
value of their shares as a result. The valuator should be aware of the impact of convertibility on the various share
classes and should consider the time value element of the conversion option.

Sandro Conversion Ltd. has issued two SECurities: 150,000 preferred shares convertible into common shares at

preferred shares have a redemption value of $5 million.
Required:
Sandro Conversion Ltd. has the conversion right and wants to know whether it should exercise its conversion right.
Solution:
Where preferred shares are convertible at the option of the issuer, they would normally be valued at the lower of
their converted value and their non-converted value. As shown below, the $4.6 million converted value is less than
the $5.0 million redemption value.
Typically, an issuer would exercise this option if the non-converted value of the sPEcial shares exceeds the value
after conversion. In such an instance, the holder of preferred shares would lose value [$4.6 million - $5.0 million =
-$0.4 million], which would accrue to the common shares [existing common shares = 500 x ($30.77 - $30.00) =
$0.4 million]. Assuming that the issuer wants to maximize common shareholder value, this conversion would be in
the issuer's interest.
Note: This example is for illustration purposes only. In practice, one would question why the preferred holder would
accept an unprotected forced conversion right.

Where the conversion rights cannot be exercised for a sPEcific PEriod of time, the value of the sPEcial shares may
be discounted to recognize this disadvantage to the holder.
These considerations apply to all convertible SECurities (e.g., convertible debentures) and the valuator should be
aware of any potential for dilution when valuing an interest in the common shares of a company.
7.5.7 Ranking of Preferred Shares
The rank of a class of preferred shares influences its value. Subordinated shares are typically less valuable than
higher ranking shares due to the greater risk associated with receiving dividends and repaying capital. The valuator
should allocate value to the share class ranked as fIRSt priority for capital repayments.
The articles of incorporation and other corporate documents may stipulate the timing, amount, and restrictions on
dividends, in addition to the ranking of the shares' class with regard to the repayment of capital on liquidation or sale.
7.5.8 Preferred Share Liquidation Premiums
In rare instances, holders of preferred shares are entitled to a premium over stated or par value on liquidation
of the issuer. Where the issuer's business is valued as a going concern, such a premium typically would not be
accounted for in the value of the preferred shares.
Where the business is valued on a liquidation basis, any appropriate liquidation premium normally would be
considered a component of preferred share value. However, where the estimated net after-tax proceeds on
liquidation at the corporate level is less than the liquidation value of the preferred shares, a discount from the
liquidation value of the preferred shares would be applied to reflect this.

7.6 Discounts for Restricted Shares
In many circumstances, shares of a corporation will be subject to a restriction that limits the ability of the
shareholder to vote and/or freely trade the shares. This SECtion focuses on the inherent disadvantages associated
with restrictions on transfer.
7.6.1 Studies on Restrictions on Fair Market Value (FMV)
The impact of restrictions on FMV has been the subject of numerous studies. For example, in one of the fIRSt
studies in the area, William L. Silber noted in "Discounts on Restricted Stock: The Impact of Illiquidity on Stock
Prices" (Financial Analyst Journal, July/August 1991), that, based on comparisons between restricted SECurities
ineligible for resale for a two-year holding PEriod and unrestricted (but otherwise identical) shares of the same
company, the restricted shares are offered, on average, at a discount of more than 30%, although the discount
varies widely from company to company. There are more recent articles and studies in this area, and you are
encouraged to conduct your own review.
Other studies suggest, however, that the stocks analyzed in these cases have other attributes that affect value and
therefore make a poor proxy for estimating marketability discount.
While Silber's article (and other similar studies) may provide a starting point for determining the impact of transfer
restrictions on the discount from ratable value, an analysis of the variance in discounts noted in those studies is
required. The following factors may be considered:
* Duration of the restriction PEriod;
* Nature of the restriction; and
* Financial PErformance of the company.
7.6.1.1 Duration of the Restriction PEriod
In general, the longer the restriction PEriod, the greater the disadvantage of not being able to trade the shares (and
as a result, the greater the indicated discount for the restriction PEriod).
A prevalent feature of many employer-sponsored restricted stock plans is that the restrictions on transfer are
lifted for some fraction of the total award on each anniversary following the date of the award. For example, the
employee may be awarded 1,000 shares with the transfer restriction lifted on 100 shares on each anniversary for
10 years. The discount applicable to each portion of the award will vary according to the length of the restriction
PEriod. The aggregate discount should reflect the progressive release provisions. Conceptually, the valuator can
calculate a separate discount for each component of the restriction PEriod, as illustrated below:

7.6.1.2 Nature of the Restriction
The size of the discount dePEnds on the sPEcific restriction provisions associated with a particular shareholder.
For example, in the case of shares issued by private corporations to employees, it is rare for the issuer to PErmit
any other transfer while the individual remains employed with the company. In general, the applicable discount will
vary inversely with the liquidity and transferability of the shares: the lower the liquidity of a given share, the higher
the resulting discount.
7.6.2 Quantitative Analysis
Empirical studies of the inherent disadvantage of restrictions on transfer can provide a useful benchmark for the
analysis. However, it is important to consider the sPEcific circumstances of the shares being valued.
Several quantitative methodologies have been develoPEd to help assess the particular attributes of a company
that affect the discount from FMV. While these quantitative methodologies merit consideration, they must be
applied with caution, given that the determination of the appropriate discount is by no means an exact science.
Option pricing models can provide a useful basis for quantiFYing the appropriate discount. In particular, the BlackScholes option pricing model is often used because this model is based on EuroPEan options9 that exhibit many
similar traits to restricted shares. The date on which the EuroPEan option may be exercised is akin to the expiry
date of the restriction on transfer.
The formula and inputs for the Black-Scholes model are explored extensively in Module 5.
When using an option pricing model to quantitatively assess a restriction discount, it is, of course, useful to
compare the results derived using such quantitative methodologies to the empirical studies.
9 As discussed in Module 5, EuroPEan options are exercisable only on one sPEcific date. In contrast, American options are exercisable
at any time between the date of issue and the stipulated expiry date.

07 -- Valuation of SPEcific Share Classes
7.6.3 Restricted Shares Offered as Employee ComPEnsation
More and more executives are finding their comPEnsation is tied to the success of their employer company
through vehicles such as stock options, restricted shares, and employee share ownership plans. Since this tyPE of
comPEnsation is on the increase, it is important to know how the characteristics of these investments affect their
valuation for income tax and other purposes.
In the case of restricted shares, the shares issued to the executive are not immediately transferable or saleable and
are vested only after a sPEcified PEriod of future service.
On termination of employment for any reason before the date of vesting, the shares are usually forfeited by the
employee and reacquired by the employer. This SECtion examines the valuation of such shares and the impact of
the "value to owner" concept advanced by the CRA.
Restricted shares issued by public companies can usually be traded freely after they are vested. Therefore, the
PEriod from the date of the award to the date of vesting (the vesting PEriod) and the restriction PEriod are
one and the same. The shares of a private corporation, however, are not usually freely tradable after they vest.
They typically cannot be transferred to a third party or sold back to the issuer, directly or indirectly, during the
individual's employment with the company. They may, however, be sold if some extraordinary triggering event
occurs (i.e., if the entire business is sold to a third party).
7.6.3.1 Assessment of Value to Owner -- Discount from Ratable FMV
For Canadian tax purposes, an employee is generally deemed to have acquired the shares and received a taxable
benefit on the date that the restricted stock is awarded. According to paragraph 7(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act,
the benefit is calculated as the "value" of the restricted shares at the time of the award, less any amount paid or
payable to the corporation by the employee for the shares.
Where the issuer of restricted shares is a CCPC, and the employee deals at arm's length with the CCPC, tax
becomes payable only when the shares are ultimately sold by the employee. (Unless otherwise indicated, this
SECtion focuses on shares issued by public corporations and private corporations other than CCPCs.)
In general, the term "value," as used in the Income Tax Act, is interpreted to mean FMV. The CRA has indicated,
however, that in assessing the benefit to the employee, a "value to owner" concept is appropriate. Hence, the
determination of the taxable benefit begins with a quantification of the ratable FMV of the underlying shares.
Generally, these "value" calculations will be relevant to private companies. With public companies, the trading
price will most often be the starting point in determining FMV. The valuator can then determine the appropriate
discount (if any) to reflect the sPEcific characteristics, terms, and conditions of the shares under consideration
(including the impact of the restriction PEriod) and the employee's sPEcific circumstances.
The size of the appropriate discount will dePEnd on the valuation methodology used. Any sPEcific circumstances
that might affect the discount should be separately assessed, including the likelihood that:
* The shares may not be freely tradable during the restriction PEriod ("restriction PEriod risk");
* The shares will not be vested because the employee will leave the company during the restriction PEriod ("risk
of forfeiture"); and
* Other attributes, terms, and conditions of the shares and the issuer corporation may affect the ultimate benefit
to the employee ("other attributes").
The appropriate discount is usually expressed as a PErcentage reduction from ratable FMV.
Most plans provide that if employment ceases before the date of vesting, the shares are forfeited by the employee
and reacquired by the company. Therefore, the determination of the benefit to the employee at the date of the
award (i.e., value to owner) must include an evaluation of the likelihood that the employee will remain with the
company until the date of vesting.
161
07 -- Valuation of SPEcific Share Classes
For example, consider the case of an employee who received restricted shares and resigns shortly thereafter
(i.e., before the shares are IRRevocably vested). Assuming that the valuator could have reasonably predicted the
resignation at the date of valuation (if, for instance, the employee's dissatisfaction had been well documented, they
were actively searching for other employment, etc.), the discount from ratable value would reflect the uncertainty
of continued employment as of the date of valuation.
In general, as the vesting PEriod increases, the risk of forfeiture also increases. A review of the average annual
turnover among employees participating in the restricted stock plan can provide an initial benchmark for the risk
of forfeiture. The analysis should focus on plan participants (as opposed to all employees) because participation
in the restricted stock plan may suggest above-average PErformance and may reduce the likelihood of termination
before vesting (i.e., plan participants may be a more homogeneous comparator group). The benchmark can then
be adjusted according to the employee's sPEcific circumstances.
The valuator may also consider the following factors:
* The employee's tenure;
* The employee's career progression with the corporation;
* The possibility of death or disability; and
* Corporate character and PErformance.
These are discussed in the following SECtions.
7.6.3.2 The Employee's Tenure
Since most employees with significant tenure may be considered less likely to leave the company before the
expiration of the vesting PEriod, tenure should be compared to the average tenure of employees within the
corporation (particularly employees who have been awarded restricted shares), as well as industry norms. The
employee's position should be considered, along with average tenures of that position in the relevant industry. For
example, CEOs in certain industries have notoriously short employment tenures.
The availability of alternative employment should also be considered. Many restricted stock plans provide
comPEnsation for employees who have been laid off. To the extent that these provisions are available, the risk of
forfeiture may be reduced.
7.6.3.3 The Employee's Career Progression Within the Corporation
The valuator may wish to interview the appropriate parties and review the employee's PErsonnel file and
documented PErformance appraisals.
7.6.3.4 The Possibility of Death or Disability
In the spirit of compassion, the death of an employee sometimes gives rise to full vesting. The valuator needs to
consider the terms of the plan and the impact of a premature death. The concept of mortality has been accepted
by the courts in the determination of benefits (e.g., in PErsonal injury matters involving the determination of an
individual's lost future income). Given the age of the participants, and the relatively short vesting PEriods typical
of these plans, mortality will generally have a limited effect on value. The same can be said for disability, which is a
more common occurrence.
7.6.3.5 Corporate Character and PErformance
Corporate size, stage of development, and PErformance affect the risk of forfeiture. Successful companies are
likely to keep good employees, and good employees are more likely to stay with successful firms than with those
exPEriencing difficulties.
162
07 -- Valuation of SPEcific Share Classes
When calculating the benefit of a particular employee's shareholding, there are, of course, many other
considerations that may give rise to a discount (particularly in the case of private corporations). A careful review
of the agreement between the employer and the employee, for instance, will indicate the rights and privileges
bestowed on the employee (i.e., the shareholder).
To the extent that the shareholder's rights, privileges, and benefits are further curtailed, the discount should be
adjusted accordingly.
MQE Example 7.1
Michael, a resident of Canada, graduated last year with a bachelor's degree in computer science. He immediately
gained employment with a highly regarded develoPEr of healthcare-related software, HealthRecords Inc.
HealthRecords went public approximately 15 months prior to the commencement of Michael's employment with the
company. The public stock market price of HealthRecords enjoyed considerable gains over the PEriod from its initial
public offering in May last year to the end of last year. A significant component of Michael's comPEnsation is in the
form of restricted stock in the company.
SPEcifically, on June 30 last year, Michael received 25,000 restricted shares of HealthRecords (the Restricted
Shares). The conditions and characteristics of the Restricted Shares are outlined below. Michael's tax accountant
has correctly informed him that restricted shares are taxable to Canadian residents immediately upon issuance.
As such, Michael understands that on his last year's tax return, which he has not yet filed, he must include the
fair market value of the restricted shares. Michael's brother, Joel, has told him that "the fair market value of the
restricted shares is equal to the stock market trading price as at the date of issue." Confused by his brother's
statement, Michael has appROAched you, CBV, to provide insight in this regard.
Furthermore, Michael has heard rumours that next year, HealthRecords may give him the choice to receive either
stock options in the company or additional restricted shares. As such, Michael would like you to advise him on the
issues he should consider before making his decision.
A listing of the stock market price for HealthRecords shares over the relevant PEriod is included below along
with projections prepared by the company for additional financing purposes. You have also looked into some
comparable companies, as outlined below.
Characteristics of the Restricted Shares
The following is an overview of the relevant characteristics of the Restricted Shares:
* The Restricted Shares have voting rights that are identical to HealthRecords common shares;
* The Restricted Shares cannot be sold, assigned, transferred (to anyone other than a spouse, child, grandchild,
or trust), pledged, or otherwise disposed of until vested; and
* Vesting of Restricted Shares automatically ceases on the termination of employment with HealthRecords.
Vesting PEriod
Participants who hold Restricted Shares in HealthRecords are subject to the following vesting schedule: 25% in
each of June 30 this year, December 31 this year, June 30 next year, and December 31 next year.

Re: Restricted stock
Fair Market Value
Joel is likely incorrect in suggesting that the fair market value of the Restricted Shares is equal to the public
market trading price of the HealthRecords shares. The definition of fair market value suggests, among other
factors, "highest price obtainable in an oPEn and unrestricted market." As a result of the significant restrictions that
the Restricted Shares are subject to, a third-party purchaser would not be indifferent to owning a freely tradable
common share of Health Records relative to the Restrictive Share. That is, a third-party purchaser of the Restricted
Shares would require a discount relative to the price of a freely tradable share of HealthRecords, due to the relative
illiquidity of the Restricted Share as compared to a freely tradable share (since HealthRecords shares are publicly
tradable, the trading price includes liquidity value). The reasons warranting a restricted share discount include the
following:
* During the restriction PEriod, there is a risk that the trading price of HealthRecords shares will increase, and
due to the illiquidity of the Restricted Shares, Michael will not be PErmitted to realize the gains;
* There is a risk that during the restriction PEriod the public market trading price of HealthRecords shares will
decrease, and due to the illiquidity of the Restricted Shares, Michael will not be PErmitted to liquidate his
Restricted Shares to minimize losses; and
* There are opportunity costs of not being PErmitted to liquidate the Restricted Shares and use the proceeds in
alternative investment opportunities.
Factors That Impact the Quantum of Discount
Various factors impact the quantum of discount and can be applied to the publicly traded price of HealthRecords
shares to arrive at the fair market value of the Restricted Shares. Factors include:
* The volatility of the HealthRecords common shares -- The greater the price volatility, the greater the risk
there is to the holder of the Restricted Shares from illiquidity. My preliminary review of HealthRecords' recent
share trading prices indicates that significant volatility exists. This would have the effect of increasing the
discount; and
* The duration of the restriction PEriod -- The longer the PEriod of illiquidity, the greater the risk of holding
the Restricted Shares, and the greater the required discount. Since the restriction PEriod in resPEct of the
Restricted Shares elapses over a two-year PEriod, different illiquidity discounts would be required for each
tranche of Restricted Shares.
Determination of Discount
The quantum of an illiquidity discount that a third-party purchaser would require is subjective. There are several
methodologies that are commonly employed in helping to estimate this discount, such as restricted stock studies and
option pricing models.
165
07 -- Valuation of SPEcific Share Classes
Restricted Stock Studies
Various North American studies have been undertaken over the past 50 years on the values of non- marketable or
restricted shares. Some material considers "letter stock," which is stock identical in all resPEcts to freely traded
stock except that it is restricted from trading in the oPEn market for a sPEcified PEriod under the regional SECurities
guidelines. The restrictions on the transfer of letter stock usually lapse within two years, which is generally longer
than the restriction PEriod of the Restricted Shares. In addition, volatility characteristics of the letter stock may be
different for the Restricted Shares. The studies referred to above indicate average trading discounts in the range of
25% to 45%. More recent studies, however, indicate discounts in the lower end of this range.
These studies also indicate that the length of the PEriod of share restriction would also impact the size of the
discount. Generally, the longer the restriction PEriod, the larger the discount.
Option Pricing
An option pricing model can be used to estimate the cost of a put option on freely tradable HealthRecords shares
as a means of estimating an appropriate discount to reflect the illiquidity of the restricted shares. Theoretically, the
put option would allow the holder of the restricted shares to sell the restricted share at the market trading price on
the valuation date at the end of the vesting PEriod. This would allow the holder of the restricted shares to minimize
possible losses as a result of a drop in the value of the freely tradable HealthRecords shares during the restriction
PEriod. By purchasing put options, the holder can theoretically protect their position at the market price, as at the
valuation date, over a sPEcific time PEriod. The cost of the put option reflects a cost required of a theoretical hedge
on the shares over the applicable restriction PEriod.
I suggest that Michael engage the services of a qualified CBV to assist him in determining the fair market value of
the Restricted Shares so that he will have support of the income inclusion should the tax authorities request it.
Restricted Shares vs. Options Offered by Michael's Employer
In Canada, there are differences between stock options and restricted shares that should be considered before
Michael makes a decision. The following is a summary of some of these factors:
* Stock options are not taxable upon issuance; restricted shares are taxable upon issuance. As such, there is a
tax deferral opportunity to Michael if he selects the stock option alternative;
* Stock options will usually expire; restricted shares do not;
* Stock options generally have a cash cost to the holder when they are exercised; restricted shares do not; and
* Restricted shares usually participate on an equal basis with freely tradable common shares in terms of voting,
dividend rights, and so on. Stock options are usually not regarded in the same manner as freely tradable stock.
Since it is unlikely that HealthRecords will pay dividends given its start-up nature, and given the insignificant
minority voting position Michael would hold in the company, this feature is not valuable to him at this time.
Given the significant preferential tax treatment accorded to stock options in Canada, the relative unlikelihood of
HealthRecords paying dividends, and based on the other factors above, I suggest the stock option alternative.

In determining an appropriate rate of return for valuing preferred shares, the valuator can consider comparable
publicly traded shares with the same rights and characteristics as benchmarks. However, a directly comparable
SECurity is seldom found, and the valuator should be aware of the differences between the subject private shares
and the publicly traded shares being used as a benchmark. In the comparative analysis, the valuator should justiFY
this difference through an adjustment of the yield of a comparable SECurity, considering the following factors:
* Financial health of issuer;
* Dividend structure -- fixed or adjustable rate feature;
* Frequency of dividends;
* Participating or non-participating;
* Cumulative or non-cumulative;
* Voting or non-voting;
* Redeemable; and
* Retractable.
Higher-quality preferred shares will trade at a higher price and generally have a lower dividend yield (lower risk),
reflecting the strength of the issuer.
Both S&P and Moody's rate preferred stock of publicly traded companies using sPEcific valuation ratios relating to
asset coverage and earnings coverage. Generally, the more favourable the ratios, the higher the rating and lower
the yield.
The valuator should calculate similar ratios for the subject private company to determine where its preferred
shares would rank in relation to the average yield of comparable publicly traded shares.
7.7.1 Marketability Discount
When the valuator uses publicly traded preferred shares as benchmarks, a marketability discount for the preferred
private shares may be appropriate where:
* There is no retraction feature;
* The shareholder does not control the company; or
* There is no "put" provision in the shareholders' agreement.
167
07 -- Valuation of SPEcific Share Classes
The marketability discount is applied to reflect the difficulty that might be encountered by the shareholder in
quickly selling their private company preferred shares.
Example 7.8: Public Company Benchmarks
Harold owns all of the preferred shares in Systems Sound Company (SSC). The shares earn a cumulative dividend
of $4.25 PEr share PEr year. The asset coverage ratios and earnings coverage ratios of SSC all fall into the BB
ranking according to S&P's rating methodology for publicly traded preferred stock. Dividend yields for issuers of
this credit rating range from 7.2% to 12.8%. As the valuator, you select an appropriate yield of 12% based on the
available information.
Required:
What is the value of the marketability discount?
Solution:
The value of each preferred share using the dividend discount model is $35.42 ($4.25/0.12). Based on your research
and analysis, you assess the quantum of the marketability discount to be 30%, which results in a value of $24.79 PEr
share [$35.42 x (1 - 0.30)].
Example 7.9: Preferred Shares
You have been asked to value a 33% interest (10,000 shares) in sPEcial shares that have the following terms:
* Dividend yield = 4%;
* Retraction price = $100 PEr share;
* FIRSt priority in repayments of capital; and
* Characteristics: cumulative, voting, and retractable at par.
The sPEcial shares are widely held and represent 20% of voting control in aggregate.
The voting feature is therefore not considered significant in assessing a comparable market yield. None of the
shareholders of sPEcial shares own any common shares. Comparable publicly traded non-voting preferred shares
are offering a yield of 6%.
In part, the sPEcial shares are considered riskier than the publicly traded preferred shares due to their relative
illiquidity. The company also carries a significant amount of debt in relation to other comparable companies,
resulting in a low earnings coverage ratio and a low asset coverage ratio.
The company is also not generating an adequate return on its assets; its balance sheet is shown below.

Solution:
Based on the above considerations, the valuator might decide to value the sPEcial shares using a rate of return as
follows:
* Comparable market yield: 6%;
* Risk premium for illiquidity: 3%;
* Company-sPEcific risk premium: 2%; and
* Estimated rate of return: 11%.
Based on the above, the estimated value of each sPEcial share is $36.36, as follows:
D
r
=
$100 x 4%
0.11
=
4
0.11
= $36.36
This calculation assumes that the shareholder could sell their shares at $36.36 PEr share. In allocating en bloc value
among the various share classes, the $100 PEr share retraction value would typically be taken into consideration, as
this is the stipulated amount obligated by the company. However, as the company is in financial difficulty, there may
not be sufficient residual value to allocate to the sPEcial shares to recognize their full retraction value.
Assuming the net book value of the assets is representative of their fair market value, there is only $1.2 million of
en bloc equity value to "distribute" between the sPEcial shares and common shares on a going concern basis.
The company is obligated to distribute $3 million to the sPEcial shares, but has only $1.2 million in equity capital.
The pro rata allocated value of the sPEcial shares is $40 PEr share. If the company were sold for $1.2 million, the
shareholder would receive approximately $40 PEr share from the company (excluding transaction costs) and no
value would accrue to the common shareholders.
The difference between the valuation conclusion ($36.36) and the pro rata liquidation value ($40) could reflect
factors such as the time value of money and liquidation costs. If the shares were to be sold today, the owner would
receive $36.36 PEr share. However, if the owner waited until future liquidation, they would be exPEcted to receive $40.
169
07 -- Valuation of SPEcific Share Classes
7.7.2 Options/Warrants
When determining the residual value of common shares, the valuator should be aware of other potential liabilities
that could possibly lay claim to the capital or earnings of a company. Companies often issue options or warrants to
outside investors, their directors, the management team, or to employees as PErformance incentives.
In allocating en bloc value, a valuator must consider how much a potential purchaser would have to pay to buy
back any outstanding options or warrants, in order to effectively ensure the purchase of 100% of the company.
The valuator should fIRSt determine whether options and warrants are:
* In the money (exercise price < FMV of share); or
* Out of the money (exercise price > FMV of share).
Warrants that are in the money are more likely to be exercised. In such an event, the holders of the warrants will
pay the company the exercise price for the warrants. The company will be in receipt of excess cash, which is added
to the en bloc value of equity. Although the en bloc value of the equity will increase, the number of outstanding
common shares will increase as well and a dilutive effect on the share values will take place.
The valuator should be aware of any options and any attached features when valuing an interest in common shares.
It is possible that the exercise of options will not only decrease the value PEr share, but may also change the
control position of each resPEctive shareholder.
7.7.3 Other Classes of Common Shares
A company may have more than one class of common shares. In that case, a valuator may be required to allocate
the en bloc value among the various common share classes. Under such an exercise, the same considerations
would be required as discussed earlier. A valuator should identiFY the various rights and characteristics of each
class, including rank, dividends, and voting rights, and quantitatively and qualitatively assess how and if the
features impact value.
One difference between the valuation of common shares and preferred shares of a privately held company is the
marketability discount. The return on preferred shares normally materializes through dividend payments. However,
the return on common shares typically materializes when the shares are sold. As such, marketability becomes a
greater concern for a holder of common shares, and a larger marketability discount than that on preferred shares
may be appropriate.
7.8 Other Considerations When Valuing Shares
When valuing shares in companies with complex corporate structures, the multitude of rights, restrictions, and
characteristics of the various share classes can be overwhelming. The valuator should remember and apply basic
valuation principles used in assessing value for any other shares or assets. The following is a list of key questions to
ask when encountering a share valuation:
* Who would be the likely purchaser of the shares?
Under the fair market value concept, the value of the shares would be the highest price available in an oPEn
and unrestricted market. In the case of a small, closely held family business, a potential third-party investor
may be reluctant to be the "outsider" in a company. A more likely buyer might be one of the family members
themselves, as they could be willing to pay the highest price for those shares.
* How much would a buyer be willing to pay for these shares? What circumstances would a third-party
purchaser encounter if they were to purchase the shares?

In addition to considering the various rights and characteristics of the shares in question, the valuator should
also assess the conditions a potential purchaser would face in the company. For example, the prosPEct of
investing in a company whose shareholders are family members in constant conflict would not be attractive
to an investor. Additionally, an investor would be reluctant to be involved in a company that has a history of
deception and discord among shareholders. This would have a negative effect on the value of the shares and
may effectively create a nil value if no purchaser is willing to buy the shares, including the existing shareholders.
* In the event of a liquidation or sale of the company, how much of the proceeds would be available for these
shares?
The articles of incorporation and/or other corporate documents often contain clauses that dictate the rank
and treatment of all share classes on certain events including the dissolution and/or sale of the company. The
valuator should be aware of these considerations when allocating en bloc value to the various share classes.
* Are there sufficient funds in the company to redeem the sPEcial shares?
A value calculated using the dividend discount model may have no merit if the company does not have enough
funds to pay future dividends. In addition, it is unlikely a prudent purchaser would buy the shares at a price
above what it would realize if the company was liquidated, unless there was future potential for growth or
earnings.
* Have there been any recent sales or transfers of shares of the same class?
The valuator should always inquire whether the subject shares have been sold, issued, or transferred. The
transaction price can represent a comparable benchmark in assessing the value of the subject shares.
Example 7.10: Common Shares
Raj, a shareholder of MonROE Inc., owns 5% of Class B common shares.
Approximately four months ago, Meg, another shareholder, sold her 40% interest in Class B shares for $700,000.
This transaction would suggest that Raj's shares are worth $87,500. However, further analysis of the transaction is
required.
To assess comparability, the valuator should determine whether the transaction constituted fair market value and, if
not, which principles were breached, how they were breached, and the impact of that breach on value.
Consider the following:
* Highest price available:
* Did Meg appROAch various investors and sell to the highest bidder or did she accept the fIRSt offer?
* How long did Meg search for a buyer? One week? One year?
* Did Meg reject offers of higher prices because of other considerations?
* OPEn and unrestricted market:
* Does any documentation exist that would restrict the transfer or ownership of shares?
* If so, what criteria would allow for a new shareholder?
* Expressed in terms of cash equivalents:
* What was the total consideration for Meg's shares?
* Did she receive any non-monetary benefit from the purchaser (i.e., employment by purchaser at higher than
market comPEnsation? Were there discounts on goods sold by purchaser? Issuance of non-interest-bearing
promissory note?)

* Buyer and seller both have reasonable knowledge of the facts:
* How much did Meg know about the business?
* Was she well informed about new developments?
* Did she take an active interest in the business?
* Did she hire a valuator or knowledgeable advisor to assist her in the sale?
* How well informed was the purchaser?
* Acting at arm's length:
* Was the purchaser related to Meg (i.e., shares gifted to her children, sold to her husband, or other nonarm's length tax planning objectives)?
* Who are the other shareholders? Where a controlling shareholder also owns preferred shares, it is more
likely they would act in their own interest with resPEct to declaring dividends on the preferred shares. The
controlling shareholder would protect their interest in the preferred shares they own and, indirectly, the
interest of the preferred shares they do not own.
* Neither is under compulsion to act:
* Was Meg involved in a dispute with another shareholder or associate of the company that forced her to sell
her shares?
* Did Meg require funds to meet PErsonal obligations?
When assessing comparability to Raj's shares, the valuator should determine whether the transaction constituted
fair market value. Considering questions such as the above can be useful in making this determination of how
comparable Meg's transaction is to Raj's transaction.
