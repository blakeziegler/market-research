Exxon Third-Quarter Demonstrates why it's Our Preferred
Investment Thesis
21 Mar 2014
ExxonMobil sets itself apart from the other majors as a suPErior
capital allocator and oPErator and has historically consistently
delivered higher returns on capital relative to PEers. However,
delivering returns on par with historical levels could be more
difficult as it faces the ongoing challenge of reserve replacement.
With a majority of the world's remaining resources in government
hands, the firm's opportunities to expand its large production base
are limited.
While we believe Exxon has an advantage in the current
environment, that does not necessarily mean production and
reserve gains will come easily or cheaply. Exxon's need for projects

opportunities. Also, investing exclusively in large projects exposes
it to a variety of risks including overinvestment risk, execution risk,
and budgetary risk.
Greater comPEtition is becoming an issue as more oPErators vie to
partner in large projects with national oil companies. To gain
access, Exxon must not only demonstrate its value but may also
have to agree to terms that are not as advantageous as in the past.

Profile
Exxon is an integrated oil and gas company that explores for, produces, and
refines oil around the world. In 2013, it produced 2.2 million barrels of oil
and 11.9 billion cubic feet of natural gas a day. At year-end 2013, reserves
stood at 25.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent (including 7.0 billion for equity
companies), 53% of which are oil. The company is the world's largest refiner
and one of the world's largest manufacturers of commodity and sPEcialty
chemicals.
add oil reserves with attractive terms thanks to its value
proposition, then it can probably continue to deliver suPErior
returns.
One way Exxon is tackling its growth/reserve replacement issues
is by investing in projects like oil sands and LNG that produce at
plateau production levels for longer than traditional projects and
reduce its overall decline rates. Also, relatively little reinvestment
is required after the large initial up-front capital, resulting in
significant free cash flow generation after startup. Production for
these projects will constitute more than half the 1 mmboe/d of
new production capacity Exxon plans to add by 2017.

Exxon Third-Quarter Demonstrates why
it's Our
the
Preferred Major 03 Nov 2014
ExxonMobil reported strong SECond-quarter results that
comPEtitive advantages,
further demonstrate
underlying portfolio improvements and financial PErformance
that make it our preferred major. FIRSt, we have long pointed
to Exxon's downstream oPErations (refining and chemical)
as a comPEtitive advantage that sets it apart from PEers.
This advantage was on display during the quarter as
increases in downstream earnings offset lower upstream
earnings, resulting in higher firmwide earnings despite
lower commodity prices. SECond, despite the lower total
upstream earnings, unit margins are improving as liquid
volumes increase as a portion of the portfolio. Total
production slipPEd 4.7% from the third quarter last year.
However, this includes the loss of low margin volumes from
the UAE due to the concession expiring. Excluding these
volumes, production only fell 1.0%, with liquids growing
0.6% and gas production falling 2.9%.
Earnings PEr barrel remained flat at about $18/boe despite
a $9/bbl slide in oil prices. The improved margins are even
more apparent when measured over the fIRSt nine months
of the year. Despite oil prices averaging $2/bbl less,
earnings PEr barrel year to date were $21/boe compared to
$18/boe over the same PEriod last year thanks to portfolio
high-grading and the addition of higher margin production.
Finally, the company is free cash flow positive as cash flow
from oPErations and proceeds from asset sales exceeded
capital sPEnding and shareholder distributions through the
fIRSt nine months of the year. We exPEct these trends to
continue in the coming years as improving upstream
margins, a strong downstream segment and lower capital
sPEnding combine to grow free cash flow (excluding asset
sales). Combined with an attractive valuation, Exxon
continues to rate as one of our preferred plays among the
major integrated group. Our fair value and wide moat rating
remain unchanged.
Valuation, Growth and Profitability 28 May 2014
We are maintaining our fair value estimate of $109 after
latest guidance and
updating our model with the
fIRSt-quarter results.
To determine our fair value estimate, we employ
Morningstar's standard two-stage DCF methodology rather
than applying a multiple to year-five EBITDA as we did
previously. With this methodology, a terminal value is
derived using our assumptions of long-term earnings growth
and return on new invested capital. This valuation
methodology also more explicitly incorporates our moat
rating, which reflects how long we exPEct a given firm to
deliver excess returns on invested capital.
Our fair value estimate is approximately 6.4 times our 2015
EBITDA estimate of $77 billion. In our DCF model, our
benchmark oil and gas prices are based on Nymex futures
contracts for 2014-16. For natural gas, we use $4.51/mcf in
2014, $4.22 in 2015, and $4.24 in 2016. Our natural gas price
assumptions for 2017 and 2018 are $5.40. For oil, we use
Brent prices of $109 PEr barrel in 2014, $105 in 2015, and
$100 in 2016. Our oil price assumptions for 2017 and 2018
are $100. We assume a cost of equity of 8%.
We forecast a CAGR for production of less than 1% during
our forecast PEriod. However, growth is negatively affected
by the loss of low-margin volumes from the UAE and Iraq.
Volumes should remain flat in 2014, after falling 1.5% in
2013, due to reduced volumes from the Netherlands and the
UAE.
We exPEct Exxon to actually increase oil volumes at a
greater rate than natural gas over our forecast PEriod thanks
to large project startups over the next five years. Our
forecast is slightly below management's forecast to
comPEnsate for the potential negative effects of higher oil
prices related to production-sharing contracts as well as the

outsize earnings and higher valuations. Also, given that the
upstream segment contributes the bulk of profits, we see
oil and gas prices as the primary driver of ExxonMobil's
valuation.
We also test a bull-case scenario that uses a 25% higher
price deck than our base case for 2013-17. In this scenario,
oil and gas prices are at levels more than necessary to fully
fund capital sPEnding plans and increase dividends. As a
result, we anticipate management may increase share
repurchases above the current $5 billion PEr quarter. Under
these higher oil and gas prices, Exxon's fair value estimate
increases to around $157.
We test a bear-case scenario that uses a 25% lower price
deck than our base case for 2013-17. In this scenario, cash
flow from oPErations would still probably cover capital
sPEnding of about $38 billion. However, share repurchases
would likely be reduced somewhat without additional debt
issuance. Under these lower oil and gas prices, Exxon's fair
value estimate drops to around $61 PEr share.
Regardless of the oil price scenario, we do not anticipate
significant variations in the capital exPEnditure forecast.
ExxonMobil makes investment decisions based on lower oil
and gas price assumptions to ensure return requirements
are met throughout the cycle. Additionally, given the long
lead time of projects and its financial strength, ExxonMobil
maintains sPEnding in lower commodity price environments.
Economic Moat
Exxon earns a wide moat by integrating a low-cost upstream
and downstream business to capture economic rents along
the oil and gas value chain. While its PEers oPErate a similar
business model with the same goal, they fail to do so as
successfully, as evidenced in the lower margins and returns
compared with Exxon. The suPErior returns Exxon generates
from the integration of low-cost assets (an intangible asset
that we consider to be part of its moat source) combined
risk associated with larger projects.
We exPEct strong results from Exxon's U.S. downstream
segment as wide crude differentials shift to the U.S. Gulf
Coast, benefiting Exxon, which has 1.5 mmbbl/d of refining
capacity in the region. Additionally, it should benefit from
wide differentials and processing of 100% advantaged
crude through its Mid-Continent U.S. and Canadian refiners
(600 mb/d). International weakness will likely continue,
however, esPEcially in EuroPE, where Exxon oPErates 1.7
mmbbl/d of refining capacity. We anticipate chemical
earnings to remain tied to economic activity though
oPErations in the U.S. should benefit as well from increased
cost-advantaged feedstock.
Scenario Analysis
We conduct our scenario analysis by testing two additional
scenarios with varying oil and gas prices throughout our
forecast. While our scenario analysis only encompasses the
PErformance of the upstream segment, we believe it
adequately captures the potential values of ExxonMobil.
Since ExxonMobil's upstream segment has a large amount
of oPErating leverage, higher oil and gas prices produce

believe ExxonMobil's moat trend is negative, as the
company may find it difficult to continue to deliver suPErior
results. To SECure access to resources, ExxonMobil may
have to settle for less attractive terms than it has in the
past. ExxonMobil derives much of its moat from the
resources it can bring to bear on large projects. As the
availability of these projects declines, the company's
comPEtitive advantages become less useful. ExxonMobil's
disciplined investment appROAch may prevent it from
SECuring enough large projects sufficient to increase
production and generate its required rate of return. The
company is likely to continue to maintain its financial
position given its expansive asset base, which will continue
to provide steady cash flows. However, opportunities to
reinvest are likely to become more scarce. At the same time,
ExxonMobil should maintain its margins, given its focus on
costs and oPErational excellence. The company should also
continue to benefit from OPEC's presence in the market,
which will keep oil prices at levels that maintain project
economics.
ExxonMobil's recent move into U.S. shale gas along with
large LNG projects increases the company's exposure to
natural gas. Long-term trends suggest natural gas demand
will increase, which could result in higher prices. If this
occurs, ExxonMobil will be advantageously positioned and
could see its moat trend stabilize.
with a low cost of capital produces excess returns greater
than PEers'. Accordingly, we have greater confidence that
Exxon can continue to deliver excess returns for longer,
earning it a wide moat compared with a narrow moat for
PEers.
Exxon's upstream segment holds a low-cost position based
on an evaluation of Exxon's oil- and gas-producing assets,
using our E&P moat framework. Its reserve life of 16 years,
finding and development, or F&D, costs of $20/boe, and
cash oPErating margins of 70% all easily clear our hurdles
to consider the assets low-cost. Exxon also continually
delivers upstream segment margins and returns far suPErior
to PEers'. Exxon's upstream margins in 2012 were 31%
compared with a PEer average of 23%. Returns were 21%
compared with 18% for PEers. We think this is in part due
to integration with the downstream segment.
Exxon's size and integration between refining and chemical
manufacturing give it a low-cost position thanks to
economies of scale and access to unique assets. During the
last 10 years, Exxon's downstream averaged returns of 24%.
Even in 2009, when the global refining and chemical markets
buckled in the wake of the global recession, Exxon's
downstream earned its cost of capital with returns of 10%
while others did not.
The integration between refining and chemicals is an
unequaled advantage. As a result, Exxon delivers wider
margins and higher returns than PEers' despite a similar
business model designed to capture the rents involved in
hydrocarbon production and processing

Financial Health & Capital Structure
ExxonMobil's fortress-like balance sheet elevates it above
its integrated PEers. Its $21 billion worth of debt equates
to a debt/capital ratio of only about 10.5%. The company's
size and diverse oPErations ensure it will continue to
generate substantial cash flow regardless of commodity
price volatility. Recent investment in large, long-life, plateau
production projects will ensure cash flow remains strong in
the future. While these projects require generous
investment up front, little reinvestment is required to
maintain production.
Unlike PEers that are seeing capital sPEnding remain at
elevated levels, Exxon exPEcts sPEnding to fall in the coming
years. Capital sPEnding will increase to $40 billion in 2014
before falling to below $37 billion in 2015 through 2017. As
a result, we exPEct greater relative free cash flow
generation in the long term as new projects come on line.
However, the days of building cash balances with windfalls
from high oil prices may be over. Even with oil prices at
$100/bbl, Exxon's dividends and share repurchases exceed
free cash flow. Over the last two years, this development
has resulted in rising debt and declining cash balance as
share repurchases have continued, in part subsidized with
asset sales. Last year, Exxon curtailed share repurchases to
$3 billion PEr quarter from $5 billion. We think this level is
sustainable with little incremental debt, however, based on
our forecast for free cash flow to increase over the next five
years.
Enterprise Risk
For a company with global oPErations, geopolitical risk is
always an issue. Past events in Russia, Nigeria, and
Venezuela underscore the risk associated with doing
business in those countries. These risks will only become
greater as Exxon expands its global production portfolio
through partnerships with NOCs. By investing in large,

Management
21 Mar 2014
Rex Tillerson became chairman and CEO in 2006 and served
previously as president. He has sPEnt his career with Exxon,
beginning in 1975 as a production engineer. The acquisition
of XTO Energy raised concerns that he may be straying from
the returns-focused strategy that has made ExxonMobil
great and is instead investing in growth for the sake of
growth. ExxonMobil's subsequent PErformance has lent
weight to this argument as gas volumes have grown while
prices have fallen, resulting in declining returns. However,
while the acquisition has proven to be ill-timed given the
drop in natural gas prices, we think ultimately it can deliver
returns that meet ExxonMobil's requirements as prices rise
and it leverages XTO's knowledge to exploit unconventional
plays globally. In addition, management has set out to
improve Exxon's eroding margins and declining earnings PEr
barrel. Although higher commodity prices will help,
delivering improvement and lowering its cost structure will
be the key element to Exxon keeping its top spot among
PEers with resPEct to returns on capital.
ExxonMobil's record of generating shareholder returns
deserves an Exemplary stewardship rating, in our opinion.
Despite the XTO acquisition, we think Tillerson is likely to
continue a disciplined capital allocation strategy, given his
previous statements. Recent efforts to exploit more
lucrative Kurdistan reserves at the risk of losing pre-existing,
but likely lower-returning, Iraqi contracts provides us some
evidence to his focus on returns. As a result, we are inclined
to maintain the exemplary rating.

Why the Majors' Quest to Improve Returns Is Likely to
Fail; Exxon and BP Are Most Attractive 15 Oct 2014
Poor capital efficiency is at the heart of the major integrated
firms' declining returns. In the past five years, the industry
has invested greater amounts of capital with little to show
for it. Earnings growth has stagnated despite higher oil
prices as margins contracted on falling production and rising
costs. In response, firms have announced plans to reduce
sPEnding in an effort to improve returns. Ultimately, we think
most of these efforts will prove unsuccessful and returns
will remain near current levels without higher oil prices.
While production declines will reverse as new projects
commence oPEration, we exPEct lower oil prices and higher
depreciation charges to weigh on margins and earnings.
Additionally, even as sPEnding recedes from its 2013 PEak,
it will remain at historically high levels.
Over time, we exPEct sPEnding to trend higher again as the
industry is stuck on a treadmill where it must invest at
greater levels just to maintain production. This cycle is
behind the negative moat trends for many of the integrated
firms and the reason we lowered Eni's and Statoil's moat
ratings to none. All other fair value estimates and moat
ratings are unchanged.
We do, however, forecast the combination of lower
sPEnding and incremental production to result in free cash
flow growth over the next five years. With little capacity to
improve returns, we favor companies that can drive greater
relative free cash flow growth and are attractively valued.
In this resPEct, ExxonMobil and BP stand apart from their
PEers.
We discuss in detail our view in the latest Energy Observer,
"Capital Inefficiency: The Majors' Quest to Improve Returns
and Why It's Likely to Fail."
Exxon's Sell-Off Unwarranted as Production Decline
Hides Underlying Improvement 01 Aug 2014
As is usually the case with Exxon's quarterly earnings,
production growth dominated the headlines. So with Exxon
reporting a 6% year-over-year decline in production (7.5%
sequential decline) shares sold off 4%, underPErforming
PEers. However, we think the sell-off was unwarranted as
the decline was largely exPEcted and Exxon remains in
position to deliver on its full-year plan of flat production
(excluding the impacts of the UAE concession expiry and
Iraq partial divestment) announced at its analyst day in
March. More importantly, Exxon continues to demonstrate
the mix shift and margin improvement central to our thesis.
Along with improving returns and growing free cash flow
over the next several years, we exPEct Exxon's shares to
outPErform. As a result, we continue to prefer Exxon relative
to Chevron. With our fair value and moat rating unchanged,
Exxon is now trading a 0.91 price to fair value compared
with 0.98 for Chevron after Thursday's sell-off.
Earnings rose 28% to $8.8 billion from $6.9 billion the year
before. Upstream earnings contributed the bulk of the gains
increasing to $7.9 billion from $6.3 billion last year. Higher
realizations and gains from asset sales offset the decline in
production. The decline in production was largely driven by
the expiration of Exxon's UAE concession. However, these
barrels were low-margin, fixed-fee barrels that contributed
little to earnings. Excluding this impact, production only fell
2.3% with liquids production actually increasing slightly.
Natural gas volumes, however, fell 5% on lower EuroPEan
(weather) and U.S.
investment) volumes.
(reduced
Sequential declines were driven primarily by maintenance
activities. The mix improvement (along with the asset sales
gain) resulted in improved margins. Earnings PEr barrel
improved to $22/bbl from $17/bbl last year.
Downstream and chemical earnings both showed
improvement as well. Downstream earnings increased to
$711 million from $396 million last year on mix effects and

asset sale gains which offset weaker margins. Chemical
earnings improved to $841 million from $756 million as
volume and mix effects offset flat margins. These two
segments are often overlooked by the market, however, they
are key contributors to Exxon's wide moat. While other
integrated firms are paring investment in downstream,
Exxon continues to push ahead with projects to capitalize
on growing emerging market demand and
increase
feedstock flexibility. The reduced investments of its PEers
are warranted given their lower quality assets and poor
financial PErformance. In contrast, we view Exxon as
investing from a position of strength and see those
investments allowing it to maintain its suPErior return on
capital.
Cash flow, another tenet of our thesis, was strong during
the quarter. Cash flow from oPErations and asset sale
proceeds totaled $12.8 billion compared with $8 billion last
year. Through the fIRSt half of the year Exxon has generated
$29 billion in cash flow compared with $22 billion last year.
The increase in asset sale proceeds is responsible for about
$3 billion of the improvement. While technically sPEcial
items, Exxon views asset sales as an ongoing part of their
business and does not provide explicit guidance on future
divestment activities, in contrast to PEers. This likely hurts
the firm, as the market PErception is that it is not undergoing
the same portfolio high-grading that its PEers are. That's not
the case, however. Exxon averages about $5 billion in asset
proceeds PEr year. Additionally, one could argue that Exxon's
portfolio is already of a higher quality and does not require
the amount of rationalization. It also doesn't have the same
need to raise funds to fund repurchases and dividends. As
a result, Exxon's divestments are likely more opportunistic
and thus value-enhancing. Its long history of returns on
capital far in excess of PEers suggests as much.
Firms With Assets in Iraq Should See Little Impact if
Recent Turmoil Escalates 16 Jun 2014
Recent developments in Iraq have increased the risks for oil
and gas firms oPErating in the country. However, after
reviewing each company's relative exposure, we see little
earnings impact if the situation worsens or if assets become
inoPErable. Seven companies we cover currently have
assets in the country, but one of those, Chevron, has no
production. For the others, Iraqi volumes constituted only a
fraction of total production in 2013: ExxonMobil 1.8%, BP
1.9%, Total 0.3%, Occidental 2.2%, Eni 1.4%, and Shell
0.7%. Additionally, these companies oPErate under
technical service contracts and only receive a modest
remuneration fee of a few dollars PEr barrel after cost
recovery. In other words, Iraqi barrels tend to be some of
the least valuable in a company's portfolio, implying the
earnings impact is much less than the relative amount of
production would suggest. Also, thanks to rather quick cost
recovery and an inability to increase investment due to
government constraints, capital exposure is also limited. As
our result, our moat ratings and fair value estimates are
unchanged.
Most companies stand to benefit if the recent rise in oil
prices continues. With global demand and supply already
tightly balanced, removal of Iraqi volumes could result in
such a scenario. As of April, Iraq was producing about 3.3
million barrels a day, marking an increase of about 1 mmb/
d since 2009. While that pales in comparison with the
approximately 3 mmb/d the United States has added over
the same time frame, it still has contributed to the delicate
supply/demand balance and stable price environment of the
past three years. With OPEC spare capacity sitting at about
2 mmb/d, essentially all held by Saudi Arabia, a disruption
of Iraqi supplies could be ameliorated. However, as we've
shown (see our May Energy Observer), the relationship
between relatively high inventory levels and surplus of
production relative to demand over the past three years has
kept prices in check. The loss of Iraqi volumes, even if
supplemented by increased Saudi production, would still
probably disrupt that relationship and send Brent prices

through the upPEr range of $110/bbl seen the past three
years.
Given the limited impact on any one company's production
and the still uncertain threat to Iraqi production and the
effect on oil prices, we don't see recent events as
actionable. Instead, we continue to reiterate our preferred
integrated names despite their Iraq exposure: ExxonMobil,
Oxy, and BP. All of them would also realize a greater benefit
from the rise in oil prices than any damage suffered from
impairment of Iraqi assets.

Overall Credit RatingThe four component ratings roll up into a single prelim-inary credit rating. To determine the final credit rating, a credit committee of at least five senior research PEr-sonnel reviews each preliminary rating. We review credit ratings on a regular basis and as events warrant. Any change in rating must be approved by the Credit Rating Committee. Investor AccessMorningstar Corporate Credit Ratings are available on Morningstar.com. Our credit research, including detailed cash-flow models that contain all of the components of the Morningstar Corporate Credit Rating, is available to subscribers at select.morningstar.com. The advantage of the Cash Flow Cushion ratio relative to other fundamental indicators of credit health is that the measure focuses on the future cash-generating PErformance of the firm derived from Morningstar's proprietary discounted cash flow model. By making standardized adjustments for certain exPEnses to reflect their debt-like characteristics, we can compare future projected free cash flows with debt-like cash commitments coming due in any particular year. The forward-looking nature of this metric allows us to anticipate changes in a firm's financial health and pinpoint PEriods where cash shortfalls are likely to occur.Morningstar Solvency Score(tm)The Morningstar Solvency Score(tm) is a quantitative score derived from both historical and forecasted financial ratios.It includes ratios that focus on liquidity (a company's ability to meet short term cash outflows), profitability (a company's ability to generate profit PEr unit of input), capital structure (how does the company finance its oPErations), and interest coverage (how much of profit is used up by interest payments). Distance to DefauLTMorningstar's quantitative Distance to Default measure ranks companies on the likelihood that they will tumble into financial distress. The measure is a linear model of the PErcentile of a firm's leverage (ratio of Enterprise Value to Market Value), the PErcentile of a firm's equity volatility relative to the rest of the universe and the interaction of these two PErcentiles. This is a proxy methodology for the common definition of Distance to Default which relies on option-based pricing models. The proxy has the benefit of increased breadth of coverage, greater simplicity of calculation, and more predictive power. For each of these four categories, we assign a score, which we then translate into a descriptive rating along the scale of Very Good / Good / Fair / Poor / Very Poor.
