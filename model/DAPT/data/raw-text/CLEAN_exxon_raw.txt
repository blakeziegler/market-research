ExxonMobil distinguishes itself as a superior capital allocator and operator, consistently delivering higher returns on capital than peers. However, sustaining historical returns is becoming more difficult due to limited access to reserves, as most remaining resources are state-controlled. Its ability to grow production and reserves depends heavily on large-scale projects, which carry inherent risks—overinvestment, execution, and budgetary issues.

Exxon faces rising competition for partnerships with national oil companies, often requiring less favorable terms. Still, it capitalizes on its expertise, as shown in deals like the Rosneft Arctic exploration. By focusing on long-life, plateau-producing projects like oil sands and LNG, Exxon aims to counter production declines and generate long-term cash flow. These projects are expected to contribute over half of Exxon’s 1 mmboe/d of new capacity by 2017.

Exxon’s Arctic exploration with Rosneft exemplifies how it leverages its value proposition to access reserves on favorable terms. Longer-lived projects reduce decline rates and need less reinvestment, boosting free cash flow after startup.

Third-quarter results showed strong downstream performance offsetting weak upstream returns. Unit margins rose due to a shift toward higher-margin liquids. Despite falling commodity prices, Exxon maintained flat earnings per barrel. Portfolio upgrades and margin improvement supported earnings of $21/boe YTD, compared to $18/boe last year.

Cash flow from operations and asset sales exceeded capital expenditures and shareholder returns, keeping Exxon free cash flow positive. These trends are expected to continue, with growing upstream margins, strong downstream performance, and reduced capital spending contributing to cash generation.

Production CAGR forecast: <1%, impacted by volume losses in UAE and Iraq. Oil volume growth is expected to outpace gas due to new projects.

Bull Scenario: +25% price deck → FVE: $157
Bear Scenario: -25% price deck → FVE: $61

Exxon makes investments assuming lower prices to ensure minimum return thresholds. Even in lower price environments, it continues spending due to project lead times and strong financials.

Moat Analysis:
Exxon earns a wide moat by integrating low-cost upstream and downstream assets. It consistently outperforms peers in margin and return metrics. Its disciplined capital allocation and project execution enhance its durable advantage.

However, its moat trend is negative. Future resource access may require compromises, reducing the value of its existing competitive advantages. As attractive projects diminish, Exxon’s ability to maintain suPErior returns may fade.

Operationally, Exxon continues to benefit from U.S. downstream operations due to advantaged crude. Mid-Continent and Canadian refineries process 100% advantaged crude. International operations, particularly in Europe, may remain weak.

Scenario Analysis:
Two additional scenarios assess upstream segment value under price swings. Due to high oPErating leverage, Exxon sees substantial FVE changes in response to commodity price volatility.

Despite reduced reinvestment opportunities, Exxon is expected to preserve its margins through cost focus and operational efficiency. OPEC’s presence helps support oil prices, maintaining project viability.

Exxon remains one of the most efficient and resilient integrated oil majors, but future growth will require navigating increased risk and reduced project availability. ExxonMobil’s recent move into U.S. shale gas along with large LNG projects increases the company’s exposure to natural gas. Long-term trends suggest natural gas demand will increase, which could result in higher prices. If this occurs, ExxonMobil will be advantageously positioned and could see its moat trend stabilize. With a low cost of capital, Exxon produces excess returns greater than peers’. Accordingly, we have greater confidence that Exxon can continue to deliver excess returns for longer, earning it a wide moat compared with a narrow moat for peers. Exxon’s upstream segment holds a low-cost position based on an evaluation of its oil- and gas-producing assets, using our E&P moat framework. Its reserve life of 16 years, F&D costs of $20/boe, and cash operating margins of 70% all easily clear our hurdles to consider the assets low-cost. Exxon also continually delivers upstream segment margins and returns far superior to peers’. In 2012, upstream margins were 31% compared with a peer average of 23%, and returns were 21% compared with 18%. This is partly due to integration with the downstream segment. Exxon’s size and integration between refining and chemical manufacturing give it a low-cost position thanks to economies of scale and access to unique assets. Over the last decade, Exxon’s downstream operations averaged 24% returns. Even in 2009, when global refining and chemical markets buckled due to recession, Exxon earned 10% returns while others did not. The integration between refining and chemicals is a unique advantage. Exxon delivers wider margins and higher returns than peers despite similar business models aimed at capturing rents from hydrocarbon production and processing irrespective of commodity prices.

Moat Trend: Given the increasing competition among independent and national oil companies over fewer global resources, we believe ExxonMobil’s moat trend is negative.

Bulls Say: Exxon’s superior capital allocation and operational performance should continue delivering high returns on capital. NOCs lack the expertise to explore and produce oil and gas independently and will require partnerships, where Exxon remains a top option, as shown by the Rosneft deal. With coordination between upstream and downstream operations, plus integrated refining and chemical facilities, Exxon creates real value from integration, unlike peers.

Bears Say: As nations protect their resources, Exxon may struggle to increase production and book reserves. Record-high commodity prices supported recent profits and free cash flow, but high investment levels put returns at risk if prices decline. Low gas prices are currently weighing on profitability. Exxon is selective with investment opportunities and unlikely to accept less favorable terms, which could slow growth.

Financial Health & Capital Structure:
ExxonMobil’s fortress-like balance sheet elevates it above peers. Its $21B debt equals a debt/capital ratio of about 10.5%. Exxon’s size and diversification allow it to generate significant cash flow despite commodity price fluctuations. Its investments in long-life, plateau production projects will sustain future cash flows. These projects require substantial upfront investment but little reinvestment, unlike peers whose capital spending remains high. Exxon expects spending to rise to $40B in 2014 and then decline below $37B for 2015–2017. This should support increased free cash flow as projects start production. However, building cash balances via oil windfalls may be over. Even with oil at $100/bbl, dividends and share repurchases exceed free cash flow. In the past two years, share repurchases led to rising debt and falling cash, partially subsidized by asset sales. Last year, buybacks were reduced from $5B to $3B per quarter. This level seems sustainable with little added debt, assuming free cash flow rises over the next five years.

Enterprise Risk:
As a global operator, Exxon faces geopolitical risks in countries like Russia, Nigeria, and Venezuela. These risks grow as Exxon partners with NOCs to expand globally. Large, capital-intensive projects expose Exxon to downside risk from falling commodity prices, which could render projects uneconomical. Weak refining fundamentals in the U.S. and Europe may continue hurting profitability even after economic recovery.

Management
Rex Tillerson became chairman and CEO in 2006 and served previously as president. He has spent his career with Exxon, beginning in 1975 as a production engineer. The acquisition of XTO Energy raised concerns that he may be straying from the returns-focused strategy that has made ExxonMobil great and is instead investing in growth for the sake of growth. ExxonMobil’s subsequent performance has lent weight to this argument as gas volumes have grown while prices have fallen, resulting in declining returns. However, while the acquisition has proven to be ill-timed given the drop in natural gas prices, we think ultimately it can deliver returns that meet ExxonMobil’s requirements as prices rise and it leverages XTO’s knowledge to exploit unconventional plays globally. In addition, management has set out to improve Exxon’s eroding margins and declining earnings per barrel. Although higher commodity prices will help, delivering improvement and lowering its cost structure will be the key element to Exxon keeping its top spot among peers with respect to returns on capital. ExxonMobil’s record of generating shareholder returns deserves an Exemplary stewardship rating, in our opinion. Despite the XTO acquisition, we think Tillerson is likely to continue a disciplined capital allocation strategy, given his previous statements. Recent efforts to exploit more lucrative Kurdistan reserves at the risk of losing pre-existing, but likely lower-returning, Iraqi contracts provides us some evidence to his focus on returns. As a result, we are inclined to maintain the exemplary rating.

Analyst Notes
Why the Majors’ Quest to Improve Returns Is Likely to Fail; Exxon and BP Are Most Attractive 15 Oct 2014
Poor capital efficiency is at the heart of the major integrated firms’ declining returns. In the past five years, the industry has invested greater amounts of capital with little to show for it. Earnings growth has stagnated despite higher oil prices as margins contracted on falling production and rising costs. In response, firms have announced plans to reduce spending in an effort to improve returns. Ultimately, we think most of these efforts will prove unsuccessful and returns will remain near current levels without higher oil prices. While production declines will reverse as new projects commence operation, we expect lower oil prices and higher depreciation charges to weigh on margins and earnings. Additionally, even as spending recedes from its 2013 peak, it will remain at historically high levels. Over time, we expect spending to trend higher again as the industry is stuck on a treadmill where it must invest at greater levels just to maintain production. This cycle is behind the negative moat trends for many of the integrated firms and the reason we lowered Eni’s and Statoil’s moat ratings to none. All other fair value estimates and moat ratings are unchanged. We do, however, forecast the combination of lower spending and incremental production to result in free cash flow growth over the next five years. With little capacity to improve returns, we favor companies that can drive greater relative free cash flow growth and are attractively valued. In this respect, ExxonMobil and BP stand apart from their peers. We discuss in detail our view in the latest Energy Observer, “Capital Inefficiency: The Majors’ Quest to Improve Returns and Why It’s Likely to Fail.”

Exxon’s Sell-Off Unwarranted as Production Decline Hides Underlying Improvement 01 Aug 2014
As is usually the case with Exxon’s quarterly earnings, production growth dominated the headlines. So with Exxon reporting a 6% year-over-year decline in production (7.5% sequential decline), shares sold off 4%, underperforming peers. However, we think the sell-off was unwarranted as the decline was largely expected and Exxon remains in position to deliver on its full-year plan of flat production (excluding the impacts of the UAE concession expiry and Iraq partial divestment) announced at its analyst day in March. More importantly, Exxon continues to demonstrate the mix shift and margin improvement central to our thesis. Along with improving returns and growing free cash flow over the next several years, we expect Exxon’s shares to outperform. As a result, we continue to prefer Exxon relative to Chevron. With our fair value and moat rating unchanged, Exxon is now trading at a 0.91 price to fair value compared with 0.98 for Chevron after Thursday’s sell-off. Earnings rose 28% to $8.8 billion from $6.9 billion the year before. Upstream earnings contributed the bulk of the gains increasing to $7.9 billion from $6.3 billion last year. Higher realizations and gains from asset sales offset the decline in production. The decline in production was largely driven by the expiration of Exxon’s UAE concession. However, these barrels were low-margin, fixed-fee barrels that contributed little to earnings. Excluding this impact, production only fell 2.3% with liquids production actually increasing slightly. Natural gas volumes, however, fell 5% on lower European (weather) and U.S. (reduced investment) volumes. Sequential declines were driven primarily by maintenance activities. The mix improvement (along with the asset sales gain) resulted in improved margins. Earnings per barrel improved to $22/bbl from $17/bbl last year. Downstream and chemical earnings both showed improvement as well. Downstream earnings increased to $711 million from $396 million last year on mix effects and refining margin recovery.
Analyst Notes asset sale gains which offset weaker margins. Chemical earnings improved to $841 million from $756 million as volume and mix effects offset flat margins. These two segments are often overlooked by the market, however, they are key contributors to Exxon’s wide moat. While other integrated firms are paring investment in downstream, Exxon continues to push ahead with projects to capitalize on growing emerging market demand and increase feedstock flexibility. The reduced investments of its peers are warranted given their lower quality assets and poor financial performance. In contrast, we view Exxon as investing from a position of strength and see those investments allowing it to maintain its superior return on capital. Cash flow, another tenet of our thesis, was strong during the quarter. Cash flow from operations and asset sale proceeds totaled $12.8 billion compared with $8 billion last year. Through the first half of the year Exxon has generated $29 billion in cash flow compared with $22 billion last year. The increase in asset sale proceeds is responsible for about $3 billion of the improvement. While technically special items, Exxon views asset sales as an ongoing part of their business and does not provide explicit guidance on future divestment activities, in contrast to peers. This likely hurts the firm, as the market perception is that it is not undergoing the same portfolio high-grading that its peers are. That’s not the case, however. Exxon averages about $5 billion in asset proceeds per year. Additionally, one could argue that Exxon’s portfolio is already of a higher quality and does not require the amount of rationalization. It also doesn’t have the same need to raise funds to fund repurchases and dividends. As a result, Exxon’s divestments are likely more opportunistic and thus value-enhancing. Its long history of returns on capital far in excess of peers suggests as much. Firms With Assets in Iraq Should See Little Impact if Recent Turmoil Escalates 16 Jun 2014. Recent developments in Iraq have increased the risks for oil and gas firms operating in the country. However, after reviewing each company’s relative exposure, we see little earnings impact if the situation worsens or if assets become inoperable. Seven companies we cover currently have assets in the country, but one of those, Chevron, has no production. For the others, Iraqi volumes constituted only a fraction of total production in 2013: ExxonMobil 1.8%, BP 1.9%, Total 0.3%, Occidental 2.2%, Eni 1.4%, and Shell 0.7%. Additionally, these companies operate under technical service contracts and only receive a modest remuneration fee of a few dollars per barrel after cost recovery. In other words, Iraqi barrels tend to be some of the least valuable in a company’s portfolio, implying the earnings impact is much less than the relative amount of production would suggest. Also, thanks to rather quick cost recovery and an inability to increase investment due to government constraints, capital exposure is also limited. As our result, our moat ratings and fair value estimates are unchanged. Most companies stand to benefit if the recent rise in oil prices continues. With global demand and supply already tightly balanced, removal of Iraqi volumes could result in such a scenario. As of April, Iraq was producing about 3.3 million barrels a day, marking an increase of about 1 mmb/d since 2009. While that pales in comparison with the approximately 3 mmb/d the United States has added over the same time frame, it still has contributed to the delicate supply/demand balance and stable price environment of the past three years. With OPEC spare capacity sitting at about 2 mmb/d, essentially all held by Saudi Arabia, a disruption of Iraqi supplies could be ameliorated. However, as we’ve shown (see our May Energy Observer), the relationship between relatively high inventory levels and surplus of production relative to demand over the past three years has kept prices in check. The loss of Iraqi volumes, even if supplemented by increased Saudi production, would still probably disrupt that relationship and send Brent prices through the upper range of $110/bbl seen the past three years. Given the limited impact on any one company’s production and the still uncertain threat to Iraqi production and the effect on oil prices, we don’t see recent events as actionable. Instead, we continue to reiterate our preferred integrated names despite their Iraq exposure: ExxonMobil, Oxy, and BP. All of them would also realize a greater benefit from the rise in oil prices than any damage suffered from impairment of Iraqi assets.

Overall Credit Rating
The four component ratings roll up into a single preliminary credit rating. To determine the final credit rating, a credit committee of at least five senior research personnel reviews each preliminary rating. We review credit ratings on a regular basis and as events warrant. Any change in rating must be approved by the Credit Rating Committee. Investor Access
Morningstar Corporate Credit Ratings are available on Morningstar.com. Our credit research, including detailed cash-flow models that contain all of the components of the Morningstar Corporate Credit Rating, is available to subscribers at select.morningstar.com.

The advantage of the Cash Flow Cushion ratio relative to other fundamental indicators of credit health is that the measure focuses on the future cash-generating performance of the firm derived from Morningstar’s proprietary discounted cash flow model. By making standardized adjustments for certain expenses to reflect their debt-like characteristics, we can compare future projected free cash flows with debt-like cash commitments coming due in any particular year. The forward-looking nature of this metric allows us to anticipate changes in a firm’s financial health and pinpoint periods where cash shortfalls are likely to occur.

Morningstar Solvency Score(tm)
The Morningstar Solvency Score(tm) is a quantitative score derived from both historical and forecasted financial ratios. It includes ratios that focus on liquidity (a company’s ability to meet short term cash outflows), profitability (a company’s ability to generate profit per unit of input), capital structure (how does the company finance its operations), and interest coverage (how much of profit is used up by interest payments).

Distance to Default
Morningstar’s quantitative Distance to Default measure ranks companies on the likelihood that they will tumble into financial distress. The measure is a linear model of the percentile of a firm’s leverage (ratio of Enterprise Value to Market Value), the percentile of a firm’s equity volatility relative to the rest of the universe and the interaction of these two percentiles. This is a proxy methodology for the common definition of Distance to Default which relies on option-based pricing models. The proxy has the benefit of increased breadth of coverage, greater simplicity of calculation, and more predictive power. For each of these four categories, we assign a score, which we then translate into a descriptive rating along the scale of Very Good / Good / Fair / Poor / Very Poor.
