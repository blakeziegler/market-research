Calculation one is price to earnings ratio. This measures the market’s valuation of a company’s earnings power. It is defined as market capitalization divided by net income. For example, suppose MetroTech Inc. reports net income of 2.4 billion dollars in the most recent fiscal year. The company has 600 million shares outstanding and trades at 80 dollars per share. Market capitalization is 600 million multiplied by 80, which equals 48 billion. Dividing market cap by net income gives a price to earnings ratio of 48 billion divided by 2.4 billion, or 20. This implies investors are paying 20 dollars for each dollar of current earnings. P/E is most useful for mature companies with consistent earnings. It is less useful for high-growth or capital-intensive firms where net income is volatile.
Calculation two is enterprise value to EBITDA. Enterprise value captures the total operating valuation of a business, defined as market capitalization plus net debt. EBITDA approximates operating cash flow. For this calculation, suppose MetroTech Inc. has market cap of 48 billion as previously stated, debt of 10 billion, and cash of 4 billion. Net debt is 10 minus 4, or 6 billion. Enterprise value is 48 plus 6, or 54 billion. If the company’s EBITDA is 6 billion, then the EV to EBITDA multiple is 54 divided by 6, or 9. This multiple is used to compare companies across capital structures and is most applicable in asset-heavy sectors like telecom, industrials, or energy.
Calculation three is discounted cash flow valuation. The DCF method calculates the present value of future free cash flows. Assume MetroTech expects free cash flow of 1.8 billion next year, growing at 6 percent annually for five years. The weighted average cost of capital is 8 percent. Terminal growth after year five is assumed to be 3 percent. Year-by-year cash flows are projected and discounted. For year one, the discounted value is 1.8 divided by 1.08, or 1.67 billion. Year two is 1.908 billion divided by 1.08 squared, or 1.64 billion. This continues through year five. The terminal value in year five is year five cash flow multiplied by one plus terminal growth, divided by WACC minus terminal growth. This equals 2.274 billion times 1.03, divided by 0.08 minus 0.03, which equals 2.342 divided by 0.05 or 46.84 billion. Discounting terminal value to present gives 46.84 divided by 1.08 to the power of five, or 31.91 billion. Adding all present values yields the enterprise value. DCF works best when cash flows are visible and predictable.
Calculation four is free cash flow yield. This compares free cash flow to market cap, showing how much cash return is embedded in a stock price. MetroTech has 1.8 billion in free cash flow and 48 billion market cap. Dividing gives a yield of 3.75 percent. This is interpreted like a yield on a bond. High yield may imply undervaluation, low yield may imply overvaluation. FCF yield is especially important for asset-light or mature companies where free cash flow is a key shareholder return mechanism.
Calculation five is return on invested capital. This measures how effectively a company uses capital to generate returns. ROIC is net operating profit after tax divided by invested capital. Suppose MetroTech has operating income of 3 billion and an effective tax rate of 25 percent. NOPAT is 3 billion times one minus 0.25, or 2.25 billion. Invested capital is total equity of 20 billion plus debt of 10 billion, minus excess cash of 2 billion, for 28 billion. ROIC is 2.25 divided by 28, or 8.04 percent. A company creates value when ROIC exceeds cost of capital. This measure is essential for evaluating capital efficiency.
Calculation six is debt to equity ratio. This evaluates financial leverage and capital structure risk. MetroTech has 10 billion in debt and 20 billion in equity, giving a ratio of 0.5. This implies for every dollar of equity, there is 50 cents of debt. In capital-intensive industries, ratios above 1 may be common. For software or consumer goods, lower ratios are safer. Understanding D/E helps interpret balance sheet strength and risk in valuation.
Calculation seven is PEG ratio, or price to earnings to growth. This adjusts P/E for expected earnings growth. MetroTech’s P/E is 20 and earnings growth is projected at 10 percent per year. PEG is 20 divided by 10, or 2. A PEG of 1 is considered fair, while a PEG above 2 may signal overvaluation. This is useful for high-growth companies where earnings are expected to expand rapidly. It contextualizes valuation relative to growth trajectory.
Calculation eight is economic value added. EVA measures the value created beyond the cost of capital. It is calculated as NOPAT minus capital times cost of capital. From earlier, NOPAT is 2.25 billion. Invested capital is 28 billion. Cost of capital is 8 percent. EVA is 2.25 billion minus 28 times 0.08, which is 2.25 minus 2.24, or 0.01 billion. This means MetroTech generated a small amount of value beyond its cost of capital. EVA helps in residual income models and assessing value creation.
Calculation nine is price to book ratio. This compares market value to accounting value. MetroTech has equity of 20 billion and market cap of 48 billion. Price to book is 48 divided by 20, or 2.4. This suggests the market values the company at over two times its book equity. This ratio is often used for banks, insurers, and real estate firms where book value closely reflects asset base.
Calculation ten is operating margin. This measures profitability before financing and taxes. Operating income is 3 billion and revenue is 15 billion. Operating margin is 3 divided by 15, or 20 percent. This is a critical input for DCF models and comparables. Operating margin stability improves forecast accuracy. High and stable margins imply pricing power and efficiency.
