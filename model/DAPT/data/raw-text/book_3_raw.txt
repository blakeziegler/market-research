Module Overview
Welcome to Module 1. This module explores issues encountered in the valuation of sPEcific assets owned by a
business, such as identifiable intangible assets, equipment, and certain tax assets. Such assets may or may not
exist on the balance sheet of a business being valued, and where they are reported, their fair market value (or fair
value) may differ from the book value indicated on a balance sheet.
This SECtion is divided into three parts: part 1 on intangible assets and tax assets (Module 1), part 2 on real estate
(Module 2), and part 3 on blockchain and cryptoassets (Module 3).
By the end of this module, you will be able to:
* IdentiFY examples of intangible assets;
* Explain common methodologies to value intangible assets and the rationale behind an appropriate
methodology for a particular asset, given the circumstances;
* PErform technically correct calculations using the multi-PEriod excess earnings method, the relief from royalty
method, and the depreciated replacement cost method; and
* Explain how the inclusion of tax loss carryforwards, undeducted scientific research and exPErimental
development (SR&ED) exPEnditures, and investment tax credits can be reflected in a valuation.

01 -- Valuation of SPEcific Assets -- Part 1 -- Intangible Assets and Tax Assets
1.1 Valuing Individual Intangible Assets
CBVs are often tasked with valuing individual intangible assets -- such as trademarks, trade names, customer
relationships, technology or other intellectual proPErty, and non-comPEtition or management agreements -- on
a stand-alone basis. The need to value such identifiable intangible assets1 on an individual basis is driven by the
constantly evolving Canadian, U.S., and international financial accounting standards. SPEcifically, in the context of
a business combination, valuators are often engaged to measure the fair value2 of the identifiable intangible assets
acquired in order to allocate the purchase price paid by the acquiring entity to these assets in accordance with
the relevant financial reporting standard (i.e., IFRS, U.S. GAAP, or ASPE). The topic of purchase price allocations is
explored in more depth in Level IV and in the Valuation for Financial Reporting course.
Valuators are also called on to PErform stand-alone valuations of intangible assets for tax and litigation purposes.
This SECtion will examine some of the appROAches commonly used to value intangible assets.
Note: The purpose of the information in the following SECtion is to introduce you to the basic appROAches used to
value intangible assets. A detailed examination of the valuation of intangible assets in the context of purchase price
allocations and impairment analyses is included in the Valuation for Financial Reporting course. Further, sPEcific
methodologies to value certain intangible assets such as intellectual proPErty are addressed in the Litigation course.
1.1.1 Valuation of a Business vs. the Valuation of Stand-Alone Intangible Assets
To gain a better understanding of how intangible assets are valued, it is important to appreciate some of the
differences between valuing a business enterprise and valuing a single intangible asset. These differences can
include many of the key assumptions underlying the valuation analysis:
* Income or cash flows included in a valuation;
* Term or time PEriod of projected cash flows;
* Discount or capitalization rate used;
* Highest and best use; and
* Effects of obsolescence.
These assumptions are outlined in more depth in Exhibit 1.1.
Exhibit 1.1: Valuation Differences (Enterprise vs. Individual Intangible Asset)
Income or cash flows included in valuation
Enterprise -- All income or cash flows
Intangible asset -- Can either be all income or cash flows or a portion of total income or cash flows
Term or time PEriod of projected cash flows
Enterprise -- Usually includes an assumption that the business will continue indefinitely (terminal value)
Intangible asset -- Often limited to a finite time PEriod, based on the asset's exPEcted economic life (which
may differ from its useful life for accounting or tax purposes)
Discount or capitalization rate
Enterprise -- Reflects risks associated with, and returns required on, all the enterprise's assets
Intangible asset -- Reflects the risk associated with, and return required on, a single asset on a stand-alone basis
Identifiable as defined by IAS 38 Intangible Assets is an asset that is separable or arises from contractual or other legal rights.
Fair value as defined by IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a
liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.

Highest and best use
Enterprise -- Highest and best use is usually to continue oPErating as a business
Intangible asset -- Highest and best use may not be that for which the subject intangible asset is currently
being used
Obsolescence
Enterprise -- Usually assumed the enterprise will adapt to changing business conditions or oPErating environments
Intangible asset -- In the valuation of a single intangible asset on a stand-alone basis, various elements of
obsolescence (functional, technological, or economic) should be considered
1.2 Primary AppROAches for Valuing Intangible Assets
Theoretically, individual intangible assets can be valued using one of the three primary appROAches used for
business or enterprise valuations:
* Income appROAch;
* Cost appROAch; or
* Market appROAch.
Practically sPEaking, the use of the market appROAch is extremely limited when valuing individual intangible
assets, because it is difficult, if not impossible, to identiFY reliable data on intangible assets that are sufficiently
comparable to the asset being valued, and because intangible assets are rarely bought and sold on a stand-alone
basis. In valuing intangible assets, the market appROAch is most commonly used in relation to rights to oPErate,
such as taxi medallions and bROAdcasting rights, but usually only when a sufficient volume of recent trading data is
available.
Accordingly, in the majority of cases, an income appROAch or cost appROAch is used to value individual intangible
assets on a stand-alone basis (with the income appROAch being the most common).
When using an income appROAch to value individual intangible assets, the following are commonly used valuation
methods:
* The with and without method;
* The multi-PEriod excess earnings method; and
* The relief from royalty method.
The following SECtions introduce the application of each of these three methods.
1.3 The With and Without Method
The with and without method is a form of the income appROAch. This method determines the value of a subject
intangible asset by comparing the value of a business with the subject intangible asset in place to the hypothetical
value of the same business without the subject intangible asset in place.
The with and without method is frequently used to value non-comPEtition agreements, franchises, and processes,
although it can be used for other tyPEs of intangible assets in certain circumstances.
To effectively use the with and without method, a valuator must be able to:
* IdentiFY and segregate incremental cash flows attributable to the subject asset; and
* Understand the risks, if any, associated with the ABSence of the subject intangible asset.

1.3.1 StEPS in Applying the With and Without Method
Exhibit 1.2: StEPS in the With and Without Method to Value an Individual Asset
1. Determine the value of the business with the subject asset in place.
2. Determine the hypothetical value of the business without the subject asset in place.
3. Subtract the value determined in Step 2 from the value determined in Step 1.
4. Determine the fair value of the subject asset by adding the related tax amortization benefit to the value
derived in Step 3.
1.3.2 Tax Amortization Benefit (TAB)
1.3.2.1 TAB When Valuing Intangible Assets Using the Income AppROAch
When valuing intangible assets on a stand-alone basis using an income appROAch, it is common to include a TAB
associated with the future tax savings resulting from the depreciation of the subject intangible asset.
Note: Take care not to confuse the TAB referred to in the context of financial reporting calculations with the
tangible asset backing referred to when PErforming notional business valuations.
The mechanics of calculating a tax amortization benefit in Canada should be familiar, as the following formula was
introduced and explored in both Level I and Level II:
TAB = (Tax cost x Inclusion rate x CCA rate x Tax rate) / (CCA rate + Discount rate)
Exhibit 1.3 shows the calculation of a tax amortization benefit for an intangible asset falling under CCA Class 14.1 in
Canada.
Exhibit 1.3: Tax Amortization Benefit
Value prior to tax amortization benefit
Tax amortization benefit
Value of intangible asset = {[A] / (1 - TAB factor)}
TAB factor =

TC x IR x CCA x T

=
CCA + D
5.0%
30.0%
12.0%

100%
In this example, the value of the intangible asset under an income-based appROAch (before the addition of the
TAB) is assumed to be $10.0.
* The total value of the intangible asset -- including the TAB -- is calculated to be [10 / (1 -8.8%)] = 11.0; and
* The TAB is imputed to be [11.0 - 10.0] = 1.0.

01 -- Valuation of SPEcific Assets -- Part 1 -- Intangible Assets and Tax Assets
In addition to examples such as the above, valuators are often required to value intangible assets that may be
subject to non-Canadian tax regimes. In such cases, valuators generally apply a TAB calculated in a manner
consistent with the tax benefits that would be exPEcted for a market participant owning the subject intangible
asset. For example, if a market participant acquired a brand relating to cash flows derived in the United States, it
would generally be appropriate to calculate a TAB in accordance with tax amortization rules for intangible assets
in the United States.
Note: A detailed exploration of tax amortization rules in different jurisdictions is beyond the scoPE of this course.
1.3.2.2 TAB When Valuing Intangible Assets Using the Cost or Market AppROAch
Some difference of opinion exists as to whether a TAB should be included when valuing intangible assets using the
cost appROAch. Note: For the purpose of this course, assume that no TAB is applicable for intangible assets valued
under the cost appROAch.
Under the market appROAch, it is generally assumed that comparable metrics for the subject intangible asset
already include all ownership features associated with the asset, including the ability to deduct CCA for tax
purposes, if applicable. Therefore, no TAB is added under the market appROAch to avoid double counting.

1.3.4 Advantages and Disadvantages of Using the With and Without Method
Advantages:
* Sound theoretical model that can be used when the incremental benefit of using the subject intangible asset
can be determined; and
* Widely accepted methodology.
Disadvantages:
* QuantiFYing the incremental benefit can be difficult and subjective; and
* Supporting an appropriate discount rate to reflect the impact of the ABSence of the subject intangible asset on
the enterprise can be difficult.
1.4 The Multi-PEriod Excess Earnings Method (MEEM)
The MEEM is a variation of the discounted cash flow method commonly used to value intangible assets that are
key drivers of a business's cash flows. Examples of intangible assets that often act as such primary drivers are
customer relationships, order backlogs, technology, and licences, among others. The MEEM is also used when it is
difficult to obtain a direct measure of the future economic benefits associated with a particular intangible asset.
The distinguishing characteristic of the MEEM is its use of contributory asset charges to isolate and quantiFY the
residual cash flow stream that the subject intangible asset is exPEcted to generate over the course of its economic
life. It is premised on the idea that the subject intangible asset requires contributory (complementary) assets to
support its income generation, such as working capital, capital assets, employee workforce, and in some cases
other intangible assets being used together. Contributory asset charges reflect a notional economic rent that
would be incurred to use these contributory assets.
The MEEM takes a residual appROAch to estimating the economic benefit that the subject intangible asset is
exPEcted to generate. It starts with the exPEcted after-tax cash flows directly attributable to the intangible asset
(which dePEnding on the use of the asset, may be the full business enterprise's cash flows or a portion thereof)
and deducts contributory asset charges for relevant contributory assets required to generate that cash flow
stream. Said differently, the MEEM attempts to isolate residual cash flows attributable to a single intangible asset,
in excess of the fair returns on all the contributory assets that contribute to that cash flow.
The residual -- or excess -- cash flow stream attributable to the individual intangible asset is then discounted using
a rate that reflects the risk associated with the subject intangible asset. Given that the MEEM is a variant of the
income appROAch, a TAB is added to arrive at the value of the subject asset.
1.4.1 Contributory Asset Charges
Contributory asset charges consist of: (1) a return of investment; and (2) a return on investment.
The return of investment reflects the economic depreciation of the contributory asset that a third party would
exPEct as reimbursement to recover its initial investment in the asset.
The return on investment is the charge a third party would exPEct as a profit in addition to the return of
investment. For example, if a company had to lease a widget making machine (that it owns) to generate income
from the technology it has develoPEd, the arm's length lease payment would include a charge related to the
depreciation of the machine (the return of) as well as an additional charge to reflect the required return on the
lessor's investment in the machine (the return on).

1.4.2 StEPS in Applying the MEEM
Exhibit 1.4: Application of the MEEM
1. Calculate the after-tax cash flows attributable to the subject intangible asset.
2. Estimate and subtract after-tax contributory asset charges.
3. Select and apply an appropriate discount rate to the after-tax discretionary cash flows.
4. Calculate the net present value of the after-tax discretionary cash flows.
5. Determine the fair value of the subject intangible asset by adding the related TAB to the value derived in
Step 4.
Example 1.2: Valuation of Intangible Asset Using the MEEM
The following example reflects the valuation mechanics when using the MEEM to value an intangible asset.
Considerations used by the valuator include the following:
* The subject intangible asset has an economic life of eight years;
* Revenues for the subject intangible asset account for approximately 35.0% of the total revenues of the
business enterprise. Note: This is a simplistic assumption for this illustrative example. In many cases, the
relative proportion of an enterprise's revenues relating to an intangible asset will vary, and often decrease, over
time as the intangible asset may exPErience various elements of obsolescence as described in Exhibit 1.1;
* EBITDA margins for the intangible asset are as shown below;
* Contributory asset charges -- for assets including working capital, fixed assets, and one other intangible
asset -- approximate 4.0% of total revenues. Note: This is a simplistic assumption for this illustrative example.
The mechanics of calculating contributory asset charges are covered in detail in the Valuation for Financial
Reporting course; and
* The TAB factor was calculated to be 8.3%.

01 -- Valuation of SPEcific Assets -- Part 1 -- Intangible Assets and Tax Assets
1.4.3 Advantages and Disadvantages of Using the MEEM
Advantages:
* Sound theoretical model based on risk associated with the subject intangible asset;
* Value is based on exPEcted cash flow sPEcifically attributable to the subject intangible asset; and
* Widely accepted methodology.
Disadvantages:
* The subject intangible asset may not have observable discrete cash flow;
* Estimating future exPEnses sPEcifically associated with the subject intangible asset may be difficult;
* It may be difficult to quantiFY contributory asset charges when contributory assets include other intangible
assets;
* Deriving an appropriate discount rate to apply to the subject intangible asset is subjective; and
* Since the MEEM takes a residual appROAch (by starting with a cash flow stream for an entire enterprise and
deducting contributory asset charges), the methodology can theoretically overvalue the subject intangible
asset by including a portion of the enterprise value (versus value relating solely to the subject intangible
asset) or undervalue the intangible asset if excessive exPEnses or contributory asset charges are allocated
against cash flows.
1.5 Relief from Royalty (RFR) Method
The RFR method is a common form of the income appROAch used to value intangible assets such as trade names/
trademarks, patents, licences, and technology.
Under this method, the value of the subject intangible asset is determined based on the royalty income that could
be earned by the owner of the asset if the asset was licensed or, conversely, the royalty the subject company is
"relieved" from having to pay a hypothetical licensor as a result of owning the subject intangible asset.
The key factors for consideration when using the RFR method include:
* The projected revenue (or other royalty base such as units) associated with the subject intangible asset over
its exPEcted economic life;
* The notional royalty rate applicable to the subject intangible asset; and
* An appropriate after-tax discount rate that reflects the risk associated with the cash flows to be generated
from the subject intangible asset.
One of the main challenges in using the RFR method is determining an appropriate royalty rate, particularly
when valuing an intangible asset using the RFR method for financial reporting purposes. (For financial reporting
purposes, the royalty rate assumption used in the RFR method is often subject to audit.)
The difficulty in determining an appropriate royalty rate (sPEcifically for sPEcialized technologies) stems from the
lack of publicly available information on royalty rates for comparable intangible assets.
In selecting a reasonable and supportable royalty rate assumption, valuators must assess the similarities and
differences between the intangible assets driving the observed royalty rates and the subject intangible asset,
which can be a subjective exercise in itself.
11
01 -- Valuation of SPEcific Assets -- Part 1 -- Intangible Assets and Tax Assets
1.5.1 Factors to Consider When Selecting Market Royalty Rates
When royalty rates are estimated from observable licensing transactions, the valuator should pay particular attention
to differences between the intangible asset(s) in the market transaction and the subject intangible asset, as most
licensing agreements include various terms and conditions that can have an impact on the resulting royalty rate.
Particular attention should be paid to the following factors:
1.5.1.1 Non-Arm's Length Parties
Many multinational businesses transfer intellectual proPErties or rights thereto to foreign subsidiaries. Such
transactions may not be relevant in determining a reasonable royalty rate as they may or may not reflect the
royalty rate that would otherwise be charged between two unrelated parties.
1.5.1.2 Date of Licensing Transaction vs. Valuation Date
Valuators should consider the date of an observable licensing transaction relative to the valuation date for the
subject intangible asset. All other things being equal, a royalty rate derived from a transaction concluded 10 years
ago may be less relevant in assessing the royalty rate of an equivalent licensing transaction occurring today.
1.5.1.3 Financial Condition of Parties to the Observed Licensing Agreement
When the parties to a licensing agreement are not in the same or equivalent financial condition, the rate agreed on
by the parties may be distorted.
1.5.1.4 Industry
Although a licensing transaction may involve a similar intellectual proPErty to the subject intangible asset, the
observed intellectual proPErty may be used in a different industry than that of the subject intangible asset. As
such, the observed royalty rate may be influenced by factors such as comPEtition, government subsidies, pricing
policies, or other such influences.
1.5.1.5 International Transactions
The ABSence of legal protection of intellectual proPErty in developing countries may have a significant impact on
the observed royalty rates associated with licensing in those countries. Care should be exercised when considering
the use of some international licensing agreements.
1.5.1.6 Economic Life of Intellectual ProPErty
Generally sPEaking, the longer the term of the licensing agreement, the higher the royalty rate.
As such, if using the RFR method to value an intangible asset with a useful life of three years, it may not be
appropriate to use an observed royalty rate associated with an intangible asset having a 10-year economic life.
1.5.1.7 Required Investments in Complementary Assets or ExPEnditures
The royalty rate associated with intellectual proPErty requiring a substantial capital investment to support the
given intellectual proPErty will likely be lower than the royalty rate associated with intellectual proPErty requiring
only a modest capital investment.
1.5.1.8 Other Forms of ComPEnsation
Valuators should consider the existence of other forms of comPEnsation (in addition to the stated royalty rate)
in observed licensing transactions. For example, if an observed licensing agreement requires the licensee to pay
12
01 -- Valuation of SPEcific Assets -- Part 1 -- Intangible Assets and Tax Assets
the licensor 5% of gross sales plus an upfront payment of $250,000, the equivalent effective royalty rate would
theoretically be greater than 5% of gross sales. Another common form of comPEnsation is an annual maintenance
or advertising payment in addition to the stated royalty rate.
1.5.1.9 Exclusivity
Generally, the more exclusive the licensing agreement is, the higher the observed rate is likely to be.
1.5.1.10 Collecting, Interpreting, and Documenting Royalty Rate Data
Given the challenges with selecting a reasonable and supportable royalty rate assumption when using the RFR
method, valuators often encounter situations where limited transaction data exists for the subject intangible asset.
In these instances, valuators may need to bROAden their transaction search and use professional judgement to
support a reasonable royalty rate assumption under the RFR method. In doing so, valuators should document: (1)
search parameters used to identiFY comparable licensing transactions; (2) reasons why observed transactions are
included or excluded; and (3) any qualitative considerations made.
1.5.2 StEPS in Applying the RFR Method
Exhibit 1.5: Application of the RFR Method
1.
IdentiFY the revenue stream (or other royalty base) associated with the subject asset over its exPEcted life
or term.
2. Select an appropriate supportable notional arm's length royalty rate.
3. Apply the selected royalty rate to the above-noted revenue (or royalty base).
4. Subtract the associated tax deduction from the royalty payments to derive the after-tax royalties saved as
a result of owning the subject intangible asset.
5. Select an appropriate discount rate to apply to the after-tax royalty savings.
6. Calculate the net present value of after-tax royalty savings and add a TAB.
Example 1.3: Valuation of Intangible Asset Using the RFR Method
This example illustrates the application of the RFR method for a subject intangible asset with:
* An economic life of four years;
* A supportable market royalty rate of 2.0% of revenues (based on research of comparable licensing
transactions);
* A tax rate of 25.0%;
* An appropriate discount rate of 12.0% on after-tax royalties saved; and
* A TAB factor of 8.3%.

1.5.3 Advantages and Disadvantages of Using the RFR Method
Advantages:
* Sound theoretical model for asset tyPEs that are commonly licensed; and
* Easy to use and widely accepted.
Disadvantages:
* Only applicable to intangible assets that are theoretically capable of being licensed;
* Forecasting future royalty base is subjective;
* Can be difficult to obtain comparable royalty rates from oPEn market licensing transactions; and
* Model can be extremely sensitive to changes in the royalty rate assumption.
1.6 Cost AppROAch
The cost appROAch derives the value of an intangible asset by determining the cost that would be required to
reproduce or replace the service capacity of the subject asset. It is based on the premise that a prudent thirdparty purchaser would pay no more for an asset than its replacement cost.
The cost appROAch may be appropriate in situations where highly substitutable assets can be develoPEd in-house or
purchased from a third party, and/or when future exPEcted cash flows from the subject asset have not been develoPEd.
Intangible assets that are commonly valued using the cost appROAch include licences and PErmits, certifications,
internally generated software, assembled workforces,3 and technology assets that demonstrate substance but are
not far enough along the development path for exPEcted future cash flow projections to exist.
In valuing intangible assets under the cost appROAch, an obsolescence adjustment must be considered. Assets are
subject to physical, functional, technological, and economic obsolescence:
* Physical obsolescence is generally not applicable to intangible assets;
3 An assembled workforce reflects the value associated with having a trained and productive workforce established within a business
in the form of costs saved. If a business had to replace an existing workforce, there would be costs associated with recruiting, hiring,
and training new employees or contractors. In most instances, the assembled workforce is not an identifiable intangible asset under
business combination standards under IFRS, U.S. GAAP, or ASPE but is treated as part of goodwill. The assembled workforce is also
commonly separately valued to be used as a contributory asset in a MEEM analysis.
14
01 -- Valuation of SPEcific Assets -- Part 1 -- Intangible Assets and Tax Assets
* Functional obsolescence occurs when there is a loss of utility from the subject asset compared to its replacement
asset, such as the design or technology being outdated, whereby the replacement asset has a lower capital cost
to construct or oPErational costs to maintain (resulting in a higher selling price) than the subject asset;
* Technological obsolescence occurs when there is loss of utility from technological improvements; and
* Economic obsolescence occurs when there are external factors impacting the asset, such as adverse changes
in consumer demand, changes in legislation or the oPErating environment, oversupply in the market, increased
comPEtition, disruption in the supply chain, and so on.
1.6.1 StEPS in Applying the Cost AppROAch (Depreciated Replacement Cost)
Exhibit 1.6: Application of the Cost AppROAch
1.
IdentiFY and estimate all cost components that are needed to reproduce or replace an asset of similar utility.
2. Estimate adjustments to reflect functional, economic, and technological obsolescence as appropriate to
derive depreciated replacement cost new.
3. Subtract the depreciation calculated in Step 2 from reproduction/ replacement cost determined in Step 1.
1.6.2 Advantages and Disadvantages of Using the Cost AppROAch
Advantages:
* Easy to understand;
* Historical costs to develop an intangible asset are often available;
* Costs to re-create/reproduce an intangible asset can often be estimated; and
* "Build versus buy" analyses are often used by companies when considering developing technology or other
intangible assets.
Disadvantages:
* For pre-revenue assets, may not adequately capture future revenue-generating potential, thereby potentially
undervaluing subject asset;
* Historical costs incurred to create a technology might differ from current costs to re-create or reproduce an
asset (using current technologies and information available in the public domain);
* QuantiFYing functional, technological, and economic obsolescence can be highly subjective;
* Re-creating an intangible asset may not be a viable alternative due to legal protection in place; and
* Determination of appropriate costs to be included (variable, fixed, overhead, etc.) can be challenging and
uncertainty regarding the tyPEs of costs to be considered can lead to an erroneous conclusion.
1.7 Tax Loss Carryforwards
When valuing a business on a going concern basis, valuators may need to consider the value of tax loss
carryforwards. Often, the present value of the tax benefits associated with loss carryforwards are not captured
on a company's balance sheet; moreover, if a future tax asset is recognized on a company's balance sheet, it may
differ from its fair market value at the valuation date.
Much of the discussion in this SECtion has been summarized from information in Canada Valuation Service 2018
Student Edition and Business Valuation. You are encouraged to refer to these texts to read the authors' full comments.
1.7.1 Overview
The existence of income tax loss carryforwards can be an important consideration in the determination of a
purchase price that can be offered by a purchaser of shares. For a comprehensive review of tax rules surrounding
losses in Canada, refer to Level II, Module 2.
15
01 -- Valuation of SPEcific Assets -- Part 1 -- Intangible Assets and Tax Assets
1.7.2 Net Capital Losses
A corporation that has incurred a net capital loss is entitled to carryforward and deduct that loss against taxable
capital gains realized in any subsequent taxation year and carry the loss back and deduct it against taxable capital
gains realized in the three preceding taxation years.
Net capital losses include allowable business investment losses (ABILs), which cannot be claimed by the taxpayer
because of the expiry of the 10-year carryforward PEriod for such losses. However, net capital losses realized in
previous taxation years, up to and including the taxation year deemed to end immediately before an acquisition
of control, are not deductible in computing taxable income of subsequent taxation years, and net capital losses
realized after the change of control cannot be carried back to taxation years before the change of control.
1.7.3 Non-Capital Losses4
Generally, non-capital losses or business losses incurred subsequent to 2005 (excluding ABILs) can be carried
forward and deducted in the computation of a corporation's taxable income for 20 taxation years immediately
following the year in which the loss is incurred and carried back and deducted in computing taxable income in
the three preceding taxation years. In the case of business losses resulting from allowable investment business
losses, the non-capital losses convert to capital losses after 10 years. There are, however, certain restrictions on the
deductibility of loss carryforwards where there has been an acquisition (change) in control of a corporation.
Acquisition of control rules exist to prevent profitable companies from acquiring a corporation with a history of
losses solely for the loss carryovers without intending to oPErate the acquiree on an ongoing basis. Acquisition
of control takes place when a PErson, group of PErsons, or corporation takes de jure (i.e., legal) control of the
company in which the tax losses exist.
For the acquired non-capital losses to be deductible, the Income Tax Act requires that the acquired business must
be carried on with a reasonable exPEctation of profit. In the ABSence of an exPEctation of profit, the subject losses
cease to be deductible.
Furthermore, for the subject losses to be deductible in future years, there are sPEcific rules in place requiring that
future taxable income be derived from similar businesses. There are also numerous provisions under the general
anti-avoidance rule that prevent or limit the use of loss carryforwards.
Assuming for the MoMent that a pool of non-capital losses can be used, the value of the pool is a function of:
* The size of the pool;
* The exPEcted tax rate of the taxable entity; and
* The exPEctation of future taxable income.
If LossCo amalgamated with AcquirorCo, the exPEcted tax rate and taxable income of the combined entity would
determine the value of the pool of tax losses. If, however, LossCo remained autonomous, its own exPEcted tax rate
and taxable income would determine the value of any tax losses.
As illustrated in Example 1.4, to quantiFY the value of a pool of non-capital losses, consideration is given to:
* The acquisition and expiry date of the non-capital losses;
* The exPEcted taxable income of the entity that will be using the losses; and
* The present value of the implied cash tax shield associated with the losses.

Conn, CMA, MBA, CPA, with the author's PErmission.

Example 1.4 illustrates the non-capital loss effects on taxable income in Canada. The valuator should be mindful
that different jurisdictions may have different tax legislations, which could result in different tax treatments
related to utilization of tax losses (i.e., in the United States, there may be an annual cap on the amount of noncapital losses that can be deducted each year). Such differences in tax legislation affect the tax saving/tax shield
associated with non-capital losses.
1.7.4 Other Methods of Valuing Non-Capital Losses
There is also some academic literature about the valuation of non-capital loss carryforwards. The appROAches
considered include a contingent claim model5 and a Monte Carlo simulation-based appROAch,6 which considers
the future tax savings from a tax loss carryforward to be similar in nature to a portfolio of options based on the
company's taxable base.
Although there may be some basis for these academic appROAches, their use in daily practice remains limited due
to the high cost and complexity associated with creating the models, and the inherent uncertainty associated with
models that incorporate multiple assumptions.
Tax losses may also be valued with reference to observed transactions involving the sale of a company containing
loss carryforwards. However, as with any market-based appROAch, it is often difficult to obtain sufficient
information to assess the extent to which the characteristics of the observed transaction mIRRor those of the
subject tax losses at hand.
1.8 Non-ComPEtition Agreements
Non-comPEtition agreements arise in a number of circumstances; however, they are most frequently found in the
purchase and sale of a business and in employment. This discussion focuses on the impact in a sale environment,
where these agreements are typically required when a selling shareholder (that is active in the business) is
believed to be in a position to negatively affect the business and its value after the transaction. These agreements
tend to sPEciFY the "tyPEs" of business in which the selling shareholder may not comPEte, directly or indirectly; the
geographic region in which the selling shareholder may not comPEte; and the length of time over which a selling
shareholder cannot comPEte.
It is important to understand the value of a non-comPEtition agreement in a notional market context as well as
in an oPEn market transaction. In a notional market, it is generally assumed that a non-comPEtition agreement
is required to consummate a transaction. Accordingly, its value is rarely separated from the value attributed to
the business; it generally represents a component of goodwill based on the price paid by a buyer. Historically
in Canada, the same appROAch has been taken in an oPEn market purchase, with no value attributed to the noncomPEtition agreement. This may not be the case in relation to allocating a purchase price for accounting and
income tax purposes, where a non-comPEtition agreement may be treated as a separately identifiable intangible
asset.

17
01 -- Valuation of SPEcific Assets -- Part 1 -- Intangible Assets and Tax Assets
The obvious difficulty for the valuator is attempting to determine what someone would be prepared to pay for a
business without the non-comPEtition agreement, when traditionally it has been included as a component of the
transaction. This is an extremely subjective process.
Some key elements in determining the allocation of value to a non-comPEtition agreement include:
* Whether an earnout exists, which would likely place a lesser value on the non-comPEtition agreement (in a
notional market context, as notional market valuations tend to be based on a cash or cash-equivalent offer);
* The vendor's ability to comPEte after the transaction, given factors such as financial means, age, health, and so
forth;
* The legal enforceability of the non-comPEtition agreement;
* The vendor's level of interest in continuing the business;
* The vendor's level of involvement with the business, pre-transaction;
* The capital intensity (indicating a barrier to entry) of the business;
* The nature of existing comPEtition;
* The size of the business and nature of its products; and
* Whether the shareholder is asked to remain for a PEriod under management contract.
If the vendor in a transaction is appROAching retirement and has demonstrated that they have been stePPIng back
from daily oPErational involvement in the subject business, the non-comPEtition agreement would arguably be less
valuable (or have a nil value) than in the case of a younger, hands-on vendor with a greater interest in remaining
involved in the industry. Similarly, a non-comPEtition agreement involving a vendor with significant financial means
-- in an industry with low financial barriers to entry -- would be more valuable than an agreement where the
vendor would not have the financial ability to establish a comPEting business.
1.9 Management Agreements
Management agreements can be discussed in two contexts:
* Those in place with current management when valuing a business; and
* Those entered into with the vendor on the purchase of a business.
1.9.1 Purchase of a Business
Like non-comPEtition agreements discussed in the previous SECtion, management contracts come into existence when
an oPEn market transaction closes. They are generally offered to selling shareholders during the transition to new
management in an effort to retain their services and transfer knowledge, relationships, and key oPErating fundamentals.
Often, management contracts can be used to close the gap on price between a vendor and a purchaser. As such,
the price paid may be inflated over normal market rates. From a vendor's PErsPEctive, however, these amounts are
not guarantees in the event of death or if termination occurs for just cause, in the course of their duties.
Management contracts are rarely considered in a notional market context as they are assumed to be a pre-condition
to the transaction occurring and because fair market value is defined in terms of cash and cash equivalents.
1.9.2 Existing Contracts on Valuation
Management contracts are also important from the PErsPEctive of the valuation of a business because they may:
* Provide SECurity that key employees will be retained post-closing; and
* Be put in place or exist as a form of protection for key employees in contemplation of a sale.
18
01 -- Valuation of SPEcific Assets -- Part 1 -- Intangible Assets and Tax Assets
The latter asPEct is important from a due diligence PErsPEctive because such agreements will often sPEciFY the
severance available to an employee and the triggering events that would enable the employee to exercise these
rights, such as a change in control of the business or a change in function. In either case, the impact of paying
severance on the financial assumptions may be significant.
1.10 Leases -- Favourable and Unfavourable
When a business is being valued at a sPEcific valuation date, it may have lease agreements in place for its
oPErating premises. Market rent rates for the facilities leased by the subject business may have increased or
decreased relative to the actual rate in the lease; this can be common when the business is oPErating under
a long-term lease that was signed years before the valuation date.
If market lease rates for the subject proPErty have increased relative to the actual lease rate being paid by the
business, a favourable lease asset can arise at the valuation date. This is because a market participant would enjoy
a lower rate of rent compared to what would be required if the lease was signed on the valuation date.
Similarly, if market lease rates for the subject proPErty have decreased relative to the actual lease rate being paid
by the business, an unfavourable lease liability can arise at the valuation date. This is because a market participant
would be locked into paying a higher rate of rent compared to what would be charged if the lease was signed on
the valuation date.
Favourable or unfavourable leases may be recognized as assets or liabilities in the context of a purchase
price allocation for a business combination. However, in a notional valuation context unrelated to a business
combination, a valuator can qualitatively consider whether a business is paying above- or below-market lease rates
when assessing the overall reasonability of the goodwill and intangible value implied by the valuation.
To obtain an accurate measure of a true market rate of rent, a CBV may need to retain a real estate appraiser.
The valuation of real estate is discussed in more detail in Module 2.
1.10.1 Leases Accounted for Under IFRS
Under IFRS 16, lease assets and liabilities may apPEar on a company's balance sheet for the duration of the lease
term. However, the duration of these lease assets and liabilities may be different than the duration of a company's
cash flow stream as a going concern. This issue, and leases in a financial reporting context, are covered in greater
detail in Level IV.
1.11 Undeducted Scientific Research and ExPErimental Development
(SR&ED) ExPEnditures
Certain provisions of the Income Tax Act effectively reduce a corporation's pool of undeducted SR&ED
exPEnditures to nil on a change of control.
The pre-change of control pool is deductible only in taxation years after the change of control, where the business
to which the exPEnditures related was carried on continuously since the change of control for profit, or with a
reasonable exPEctation of profit.
In addition, such exPEnditures are deductible only to the extent that the corporation's income for the year from
that business or from other businesses was from the sale or lease of similar products or the rendering of similar
services. The rule thus parallels the rule for deducting non-capital losses under the Income Tax Act.
1.12 Undeducted Investment Tax Credits
In general terms, undeducted investment tax credits of a corporation may only be carried forward after a change
of control.
19
01 -- Valuation of SPEcific Assets -- Part 1 -- Intangible Assets and Tax Assets
In computing such notional tax liability, taxable income is reduced by any investment tax credits deducted by the
corporation in the year in resPEct of the business, or the similar business, and is calculated without taking into
account capital gains from disposition of proPErty used in such businesses before the change of control.
This rule, therefore, parallels the restriction on the deduction of non-capital losses.
1.13 Equipment
When valuing business interests in a notional context, valuators frequently incorporate assumptions regarding
machinery and equipment values. These assumptions typically underlie calculations of tangible asset backing and
going concern asset value.
When tangible asset backing is being determined, "value in use" is generally the most applicable. Value in use
in the context of equipment valuation generally is defined as the value in place of equipment assets, installed in
the company's location, with consideration being given to age, condition, and obsolescence. This is the value the
equipment contributes to the going concern value of a business.
Where the modified tangible asset backing or the liquidation value of a business is being determined, the orderly
liquidation value and the forced liquidation value methods are generally most applicable. Liquidation value in the
context of equipment appraisal is generally defined as realizable prices other than in a going concern context.
Although in many cases valuators make, or are requested to make, the assumption that the carrying value of the
equipment approximates its fair market value, there are instances where the services of a qualified appraiser are
required, particularly in situations where:
* The valuator has cause to believe that the carrying value of a group of assets does not approximate its fair
market value; or
* Where liquidation or so called "scrap" values are required.
Valuations of machinery and equipment prepared by appraisers are:
* Typically notional, in that they are prepared in the ABSence of sPEcific, identified purchasers for either the
assets viewed separately or the business that owns the assets; and
* May result in the determination of a number of different measures of value such as replacement cost new,
depreciated replacement cost, and value in use.
Replacement cost new is generally the cost of an equivalent new asset of similar capacity, utility, and current
technology as available from manufacturers, suppliers, and distributors, on a lowest available price basis, plus
installation costs. Depreciated replacement cost is defined as replacement cost new, less an allowance for
accumulated depreciation. The depreciation allowance takes into account physical deterioration, functional
obsolescence, and economic obsolescence, based on a comparison of the asset with new units. As in the case of
real estate valuation, the estimate of depreciation is subjective.
An estimate of value in use is normally restricted to sPEcial-use equipment essential to the ongoing business
oPErations. Value in use is usually determined as the present value of discretionary cash flows exPEcted to accrue
from use of the equipment.
When liquidation value is being develoPEd, the equipment is valued based on its "value in exchange," based on the
estimated proceeds that could be exPEcted from the sale of the assets at auction, either on an individual basis or
as a group of related assets.
In developing liquidation value, it is assumed that:
* The assets are sold on an assembled "as is, where is" basis;
* The assets are removed for offsite use;
20
01 -- Valuation of SPEcific Assets -- Part 1 -- Intangible Assets and Tax Assets
* Sales are completed within a short time PEriod (normally 3 to 12 months) from the valuation date; and
* Market conditions will remain relatively constant during the liquidation PEriod.
Where the assets are not in working order, they may have to be sold at their salvage value (where certain parts can
be salvaged) and/or at scrap value, based on their material components.
Liquidation value can be further categorized as either an orderly liquidation or a forced liquidation. A forced
liquidation generally occurs pursuant to a court order (or some other order) issued on the insolvency of a business
and is overseen by a trustee. An orderly liquidation normally is presumed to take place under more favourable
circumstances, such as the voluntary windup and dissolution of a business.
The two premises of liquidation value -- gross orderly liquidation value and gross forced liquidation value -- are
distinguished by the amount of gross proceeds exPEcted from the sale of the equipment assets. Gross orderly
liquidation value assumes equipment assets are offered for sale in a way that will realize the greatest aggregate
gross sale proceeds. Typically, it is assumed that an orderly liquidation process occurs over a 6- to 18-month
PEriod, dePEnding on economic and industry conditions.
When reviewing an appraiser's liquidation value calculation for equipment, it is important to ensure that all costs
related to the liquidation and windup, and all applicable taxes, have been adequately accounted for. Typically, a
forced liquidation yields a lower value than an orderly liquidation, given the time constraint in completing the sale.

VALUATION OF
SPECIFIC ASSETS
-- PART 2 -- REAL
ESTATE
Module Overview
Welcome to Module 2. This module covers the valuation of real estate. Since real estate is not the primary focus
of a CBV's training and exPErience, CBVs are not qualified to issue real estate appraisals. Therefore, CBVs should
seek a qualified appraiser to determine real estate market values when they do not have the appropriate real
estate exPErience and knowledge or when real estate forms a substantial part of the valuation. However, regardless
of whether a separate exPErt is engaged, CBVs should have the foundational knowledge to interpret real estate
appraisals and use them appropriately in the context of a business valuation.
By the end of this module, you will be able to:
* Explain the basics of real estate appraisals; and
* IdentiFY when real estate appraisers should be engaged.
The acronyms used throughout this module are:
DCF Discounted cash flow
LEED Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design
NOI Net oPErating income
PGI Potential gross income
REIT Real estate investment trusts

2.1 Real Estate Appraisals
CBVs may need to rely on real estate appraisers when their business valuation engagements involve one or
more ownership interests in real proPErty. From a business valuation context, real estate is normally treated as a
redundant asset; however, in some cases, the real estate and business are intrinsically linked (e.g., hotels, seniors'
housing, self-storage facilities, carwashes, gas stations, etc.). Valuators should ensure that any proPErty valuations
relied on are appropriate given the purpose and intended use of their business valuation engagement.
CBVs retaining a real estate appraiser or reviewing a real estate appraisal report must be able to accurately
interpret the appraiser's analysis and conclusions. Accordingly, a valuator should have a basic understanding of
proPErty valuation theories and methodologies, including knowledge of any professional licensing requirements
applicable to the proPErty's jurisdiction. Further, the professional designation held by the appraiser should be
appropriate for the tyPE of proPErty, as separate designations exist for residential and commercial proPErties:
* Residential appraisers are qualified to value single-detached houses, semi-detached houses, townhouses of
four units or less, individual residential condominiums, residential acreages, and vacant residential lots capable
of development of four units or less; and
* Commercial appraisers are qualified to value any commercial or residential buildings, land, and agricultural
proPErties. Commercial appraisers generally sPEcialize by geographical markets and proPErty tyPEs,
suggesting that valuators should assess the appraiser's comPEtency based on the nature of the proPErty,
particularly in the case of unique or sPEcial-use proPErties.
Professional reporting standards for real estate appraisers can vary from country to country. Some of the
professional reporting standards applicable to real estate appraisal are the Canadian Uniform Standards of
Professional Appraisal Practice, Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice, International Valuation
Standards, and the Red Book Global Standards.
Valuators should ensure that the purpose and intended use of a real estate appraisal in a business valuation
engagement is appropriate and not taken from an appraisal prepared for a different purpose. For example, an
appraisal prepared for expropriation purposes must follow the relevant legislative framework for that jurisdiction,
but this may result in a valuation that would not be suitable in a valuation for financial reporting purposes. A
valuator should obtain written authorization from the appraiser in cases where the real estate appraisal was not
prepared sPEcifically for their business valuation.
2.2 Real Estate Ownership Interests
The terms real estate and real proPErty are often used interchangeably; however, their distinction is fundamental
to appraisal theory. While the term real estate refers to the dirt, concrete, wood, and other tangible components
of a proPErty, real proPErty encompasses the rights to a proPErty. Central to real estate appraisal theory is the
"bundle of rights" concept, which compares real proPErty ownership to a bundle of sticks. Each stick in the bundle
represents a distinct and separate right, including:
* The right to occupy;
* The right to sell;
* The right to lease;
* The right to mortgage;
* The right to gift; and
* The right to exercise all or none of these rights.
24
02 -- Valuation of SPEcific Assets -- Part 2 -- Real Estate
The owner of a proPErty's fee simple estate possesses the entire bundle of rights, subject only to limitations
imposed by the government, such as expropriation and escheat. The owner of a proPErty's fee simple estate may
choose to transfer one or more rights in the proPErty to another party, such as transferring the right of occupancy
to a tenant by executing a lease agreement. When this occurs, the landlord (lessor) retains a leased fee interest
while the tenant (lessee) holds a leasehold interest in the proPErty. The rights or claims in a proPErty can also
include non-possessory interests, such as easements, restrictive covenants, liens, and mortgages.
A business valuator relying on a real estate appraisal report should ensure the ownership interest sPEcified in the
appraisal aligns with the facts and circumstances sPEcific to the valuator's engagement. For example, the contract
rent sPEcified in a long-term land lease (also known as a ground lease) may vary significantly from prevailing
market rent. When this occurs, the valuation of the proPErty's fee simple estate may be materially different from its
leasehold interest. A proPErly prepared real estate appraisal will include commentary on these tyPEs of differences
and an analysis of their impact on market value.
2.3 Market Value
The definition of value in a real estate appraisal will, like in a business valuation, dePEnd on the intended use
and context for which the opinion of value is sought. Most real estate appraisals are prepared for the purpose of
estimating market value, which is generally similar to the term fair market value. That is, a value estimate based
on the most probable price expressed in cash, exchanged between willing and able arm's length parties, each
of whom acts prudently, in their own best interest, based on reasonable knowledge of relevant facts without
compulsion or duress.
Market value is defined in numerous sources, including textbooks published by professional bodies and industry
organizations and legislation drafted by various levels of government. Valuators must ensure that the definition
of value used in a real estate appraisal aligns with the purpose and intended use of their business valuation
engagement. For example, the definition of market value and the parameters surrounding how that estimate is
derived in a certain context (e.g., expropriation) may not be compatible with a market value opinion required in
another context (e.g., financial reporting).
2.4 Highest and Best Use
Researching and analyzing a proPErty's highest and best use represents a crucial step in the appraisal process
because the appraiser's determination of a proPErty's highest and best use:
* Influences the valuation methodologies selected by the appraiser; and
* Determines the appraiser's selection of comparable market transactions.
An appraiser's opinion on a proPErty's highest and best use can be considered similar to a valuator's assessment
of a business's ability to continue as a going concern. That is, errors at this point in the valuation process will likely
result in a false or misleading opinion of value.
While an in-depth review of highest and best use theory and its practical application in real estate appraisal is
beyond the scoPE of this course, valuators should note that:
* When the purpose of an appraisal is to provide an opinion of market value, the appraiser must consider:
* The highest and best use of the proPErty "as if vacant"; and
* The highest and best use of the proPErty "as improved" or "as proposed";
* A proPErty's highest and best use may be a continuation of its existing use or a change of use;
25
02 -- Valuation of SPEcific Assets -- Part 2 -- Real Estate
* Realizing a proPErty's highest and best use may require assemblage with adjacent parcels, although the
appraiser would need to consider the timing and likelihood of successfully executing an assemblage when
making this determination;
* Researching a proPErty's legally PErmissible uses requires the appraiser to consider the proPErty's land
use designation (i.e., zoning) within the context of the entire planning hierarchy (e.g., area structure or
redevelopment plans, municipal development plans, transportation plans). In other words, appraisers consider
a proPErty's current and anticipated land use controls when analyzing a proPErty's legally PErmissible uses;
* A legally nonconforming use may or may not represent a proPErty's highest and best use, dePEnding on the
facts and circumstances surrounding the valuation engagement; and
Increasing awareness of environmental, social, and governance considerations will influence highest and best use
analyses, particularly proPErty PErformance from an environmental and sustainability PErsPEctive. For example, a
building satisFYing the requirements for LEED certification may attract capital at a lower cost than an otherwise
similar proPErty without LEED certification.
2.5 SPEcial-Purpose ProPErties
SPEcial-purpose proPErties are generally described as proPErties with designs, construction materials, and layouts
sPEcific to the needs of a certain use or user (e.g., hotels, nursing homes, theatres, arenas, etc.). In some cases, the
functional utility of these proPErties in their continued use does not represent the proPErty's highest and best use,
with some proPErties so sPEcialized that their improvements cannot be readily adapted to any viable alternative use.
Further, sPEcial-purpose proPErties often include PErsonal proPErty, fixtures, and trade fixtures, sometimes
described more generally as furniture, fixtures, and equipment. A real estate appraiser may estimate the market
value of the going concern or the proPErty's value in use1 in these circumstances.
Valuators must understand whether or not any non-realty components of value are included in a real estate
appraiser's opinion of value, particularly when the subject proPErty is appraised on a value in use or going concern
basis. In other words, valuators should ensure that PErsonal proPErty or intangible assets have not been omitted or
double counted when their business valuation uses an opinion of value from a real estate appraisal.
2.6 Valuation AppROAches
A distinctive feature of real estate includes its physical immobility and heterogeneity, resulting in localized markets
that are often fragmented, illiquid, and characterized by high transaction costs. The imPErfect nature of real estate
markets and the diverse objectives of the many participants active in these markets can sometimes lead to widely
diverging PErsPEctives on the value of a particular proPErty or particular use.
Real estate appraisal, like business valuation, is premised on three primary appROAches to value:
* The direct comparison appROAch (market appROAch);
* The income appROAch (income appROAch); and
* The cost appROAch (asset appROAch).
The tyPE of proPErty and the availability of reliable market evidence will ultimately determine the valuation
appROAches used by a real estate appraiser. In some cases, an appraiser may use all three appROAches, while in
others, the appraiser may be limited to applying a single appROAch. When more than one appROAch is used, the
appraiser may select a final estimate of value based more heavily on one appROAch over another.
1 Note that the definition of "value in use" in the context of a real estate appraisal differs from the definition of "value in use" for
financial reporting purposes under IFRS, U.S. GAAP, or ASPE.
26
02 -- Valuation of SPEcific Assets -- Part 2 -- Real Estate
2.6.1 Direct Comparison AppROAch
Many market participants consider the direct comparison appROAch the most straightforward valuation appROAch,
making its use commonplace when valuing various proPErty tyPEs, particularly land, single-family dwellings, and
owner-occupied commercial proPErties. The relative simplicity of the direct comparison appROAch also makes
it useful as a SECondary valuation appROAch or as a test of reasonableness when used alongside the income
appROAch and/or cost appROAch.
PEr the economic principle of substitution, the direct comparison appROAch is predicated on the view that market
participants base their pricing decisions on their ability to acquire a substitute proPErty of similar quality, utility,
and desirability, without undue delay. In theory, comparable proPErties considered identical to the subject proPErty
require no adjustment as purchasers would be willing to pay the exact price to acquire these PErfectly substitute
proPErties. In practice, however, comparable proPErties share varying degrees of similarity to the subject proPErty.
Accordingly, the sale price or the unit price indicated by these comparable transactions often requires adjustments
to reflect inferior and suPErior characteristics relative to the subject proPErty, including adjustments for different
terms of sale, atypical motivations of either buyers or sellers, and changing market conditions.
Appraisers can use quantitative and/or qualitative techniques to estimate adjustments, with these adjustments
applied as either PErcentage or ABSolute dollar amounts, or, in the case of qualitative adjustments, by noting
that the comparable proPErty is suPErior or inferior to the subject in a particular attribute. In theory, paired sales
analyses (i.e., the sale and resale of the same proPErty) offer the best quantitative support for adjustments;
however, paired sales are difficult to find in practice and, when found, are limited in number. Accordingly,
adjustments are generally based on a combination of quantitative and qualitative analyses and professional
judgement. In the end, the appraiser attempts to adjust the unadjusted sale price PEr unit for each comparable so
that the adjusted sale price PEr unit provides a closer approximation of the probable value of the subject proPErty.
Indications from comparable proPErties considered suPErior to the subject proPErty have their sale prices adjusted
downward, whereas indications from comparables with inferior characteristics are adjusted upward.
Not all real estate transactions meet the conditions required for their sale price to be considered representative
of market value. For instance, a transaction may represent a forced sale or purchase where one of the parties is
comPElled or under duress to transact. Similarly, a sale price may reflect non-cash consideration, such as a vendor
take-back mortgage at an interest rate significantly below market. Appraisers generally disqualiFY comparable
transactions from further analysis when they occur between non-arm's length parties or where atypical or "nonmarket" terms and conditions influence the transaction price in an unknown or unobservable manner. In other
cases, sufficient market evidence combined with the appraiser's professional judgement may provide adequate
support to apply transactional adjustments aimed at recognizing the nature and terms of the transaction, including:
* ProPErty rights conveyed;
* Financing terms;
* Conditions of sale;
* ExPEnditures made immediately after purchase; and
* Market conditions (time).
After applying the preceding transactional adjustments sequentially, the appraiser considers the need to apply one
or more of the following proPErty adjustments, which are calculated on a cumulative basis:
* Location;
* Physical characteristics;
* Economic characteristics; and
* Non-realty items.
27
02 -- Valuation of SPEcific Assets -- Part 2 -- Real Estate
Every proPErty has a distinct location and other unique features, such as the size, topography, and configuration
of the land parcel and the size, age, orientation, and quality of its building improvements. A comparable proPErty
is considered one that the typical buyer could reasonably consider as an alternative to the subject proPErty;
however, the availability, quantity, and quality of comparable market transactions vary by proPErty tyPE and
market conditions. In practice, a lack of comparable market evidence may force the appraiser to extend their
search parameters to include transactions that may otherwise be considered dated or too dissimilar to the subject
proPErty, applying appropriate adjustments as necessary.
Valuators should keep the following considerations regarding the application of the direct comparison appROAch in
mind:
* Details concerning most real estate transactions (e.g., transfer date, transfer price, identification of the
vendor and purchaser) are publicly available through provincial/state land registry offices (except for share
transactions involving real proPErty interests, in which case the proPErty's title does not transfer);
* Even if physically similar, a comparable transaction should likely be avoided if its legal interest is different from
the legal interest appraised for the subject proPErty;
* Transactions involving vendor take-back loans or assumable debt at non-market rates should be adjusted
appropriately, or the weight applied to these indications of value should be limited or eliminated;
* Foreclosures and related forced-sale transactions should be used with caution;
* Whether a market transaction is too dated to use as a comparable is a function of changing market conditions
and not necessarily the mere passage of time;
* A proPErty's location may be more or less suitable for certain uses based on its linkages and proximity to:
* Employment;
* Employees;
* Customers;
* Suppliers;
* Public transportation;
* Transportation routes;
* Recreational amenities;
* Emergency and protective services;
* Professional services and retail amenities;
* Natural amenities;
* Potable water; and
* Utilities.
* Physical characteristics with the greatest significance on value vary by proPErty tyPE (e.g., retail vs. industrial),
thus the research and analysis undertaken to quantiFY dissimilar physical characteristics must be proPErtysPEcific;
* Economic characteristics (e.g., occupancy and lease details) for comparable transactions are seldom available
in the public domain, meaning appraisers generally rely on other methods (e.g., subscription resources,
professional networks, company files) to obtain relevant details; and
28
02 -- Valuation of SPEcific Assets -- Part 2 -- Real Estate
* The identification and analyses of any non-realty components of value must be noted within the appraisal
report and be consistent with the valuator's intended use to ensure no double counting or omission within the
context of the valuator's business valuation engagement. For example, machinery and equipment included in
a real estate appraiser's valuation may be double counted if the valuator's adjusted net book value calculation
fails to consider if the machinery and equipment is recorded on the company's balance sheet under the
building line item or as a separate line item under machinery and equipment.
2.6.2 Income AppROAch
The income appROAch represents the preferred appROAch for valuing income-producing proPErties, such as multifamily apartments, offices, shoPPIng malls, and industrial proPErties that are leased (rather than owner-occupied).
PEr the economic principle of anticipation, the income appROAch establishes that a proPErty's market value is
based on its anticipated income stream considering the inherent risks and opportunities therein.
The income appROAch involves two related yet distinct techniques:
* Direct capitalization, most frequently used to value income-producing assets that reflect stabilized occupancy
and stabilized income; and
* DCF analysis, most frequently used to value more complex income-producing assets or those income-producing
assets not PErforming at levels considered representative of their stabilized occupancy or stabilized income.
Valuators are well versed in converting anticipated economic benefits into a current value estimate; however, it is
important to note that:
* The economic benefits and return requirements in real estate appraisal are calculated on a pre-tax basis (i.e.,
using pre-tax income streams and pre-tax discount rates and capitalization rates). The market for real estate is
made up of purchasers subject to varying and often unknown income tax rates and/or tax structures. As such,
explicit income tax rate assumptions are not made when calculating income streams and rates of return in
real estate appraisals (although purchasers in the marketplace may calculate after-tax metrics based on their
individual tax circumstances); and
* Market value in real estate appraisal reflects a proPErty's unlevered value, akin to enterprise value in business
valuation. The market for real estate includes purchasers who use varying amounts of financial leverage
(debt capital), with the cost and repayment terms of this debt capital varying from borrower to borrower.
With this in mind, and similar to business valuation, the discount rate and capitalization rate estimates in real
estate appraisal reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on an "optimal" capital structure aimed at
minimizing the overall cost of capital.
Sale prices for most real estate transactions are available in the public domain through land title registries.
However, for investment transactions, confirming the in-place and prosPEctive income streams for comparable
transactions can be challenging because stakeholders involved in these transactions may not disclose this
confidential information. Real estate appraisers rely on various sources to research details concerning investment
transactions, including industry contacts, company files, interviews with market participants, publicly available
documentation, and real estate database subscriptions. This data is generally adjusted and supplemented by the
appraiser to ensure a consistent methodology is used when extracting information from comparable transactions
and applying it to the subject proPErty.
The legal interest (proPErty rights) appraised determines whether an appraiser uses a proPErty's contract rent or
an estimate of prevailing market rent when the purpose of an appraisal is to estimate market value. This distinction
is critical when contract rent differ materially from market rent, particularly when this variance is exPEcted over
a longer duration (i.e., a longer remaining lease term). In short, valuators should recognize that an appraiser
preparing an opinion of market value will:
* Use market rent when the purpose is estimating the value of a proPErty's fee simple estate;
29
02 -- Valuation of SPEcific Assets -- Part 2 -- Real Estate
* Use arm's length contract rent when the purpose is estimating the value of a proPErty's leased fee interest;
and
* When applicable, make appropriate calculations to account for the anticipated time and cost of a proPErty
achieving market rent where circumstances indicate that contract rent varies from market rent.
A leased fee interest represents a lessor's (landlord's) ownership interest, while a leasehold interest reflects a
lessee's (tenant's) beneficial interest. DePEnding on the relationship between contract rent and market rent
and other factors like a tenant's investments in leasehold improvements, a leasehold interest can be a positive
leasehold or negative leasehold. That is to say, the existence of excess rent or deficit rent may provide incremental
value to the owner of the leased fee interest or leasehold interest, resPEctively, dePEnding on the remaining
duration of the lease and other lease-sPEcific considerations. Real estate appraisers also analyze the effects of
rent concessions offered by proPErty owners, calculating the proPErty's imputed effective rent and comparing
this against its contract rent or "face rent." Similarly, the appraiser will research if exPEnse recoveries from tenants
allow the proPErty owner to pass along any or all of the oPErating cost increases to the tenant rather than
assuming this risk. All else being equal, a proPErty owner will prefer a net lease over a gross lease.
Although market conventions vary slightly by asset class, the following is a general overview of how to apply the
income appROAch, sPEcifically the direct capitalization technique:
1. Review the subject proPErty's historical oPErating PErformance, including the subject's leases and/or rent
rolls as at the valuation date, if applicable.
2. Conduct a market rent survey and estimate the subject proPErty's potential gross income (PGI) assuming
100% occupancy.
3. Prepare a stabilized oPErating statement (i.e., income and exPEnse estimate).
4. Select a market-derived overall capitalization rate.
5. Capitalize the subject proPErty's stabilized net oPErating income (NOI) estimate into an indication of
value.
6.
If necessary, apply post-capitalization adjustments to reflect one-time or lump-sum adjustments not
captured in the subject proPErty's estimated income stream and capitalization rate selection.

In this example, the stabilized replacement allowance reflects an above-the-line exPEnse, meaning the deduction
is calculated before "the line" (represented by the proPErty's stabilized NOI estimate). When applying the DCF
technique, capital costs such as tenant improvement allowances and leasing commissions are often considered
below-the-line exPEnses. In the end, real estate appraisers must ensure their income stream calculations are
completed in a manner consistent with their analysis of comparable transactions.
The interconnected relationship between estimated income streams and capitalization rates cannot be overstated.
When selecting the overall capitalization rate to apply in their analyses, real estate appraisers consider numerous
elements, including:
* The proPErty's asset class, location, size, age, quality, condition, and use;
* The size, age, and quality of improvements, including their estimated depreciated replacement cost compared
to their implied market value, and the cost and timing of anticipated capital repaIRS;
* The risks and opportunities underlying the proPErty's anticipated income stream (e.g., net vs. gross lease,
below-market or above-market contract rent, duration of remaining lease term, quality of tenant covenant,
renewal provisions, options, and other pre-emptive rights);
* Capitalization rates extracted from comparable arm's length transactions, preferably on a stabilized or
normalized basis to provide consistent calculations concerning stabilized vacancy allowances, stabilized
replacement allowances, and other market assumptions;
* Public restrictions (e.g., land use designation, utility rights-of-way) and private claims (e.g., restrictive
covenants, caveats, liens, options, rights of fIRSt offer or refusal) registered on the proPErty's title, including
enforceable off-title or unregistered claims;
* Risk-free rates and prosPEctive return metrics from alternative investments (e.g., publicly traded REITs, private
REITs or mortgage investment corporations, stocks, bonds, mortgages);
* The availability and cost of mortgage financing, while considering conventional underwriting metrics (e.g.,
loan-to-value, debt service coverage, capital reserve requirements) used by lenders when evaluating loan
opportunities; and
* The proPErty's underlying land value, including the timing and scoPE of the proPErty's redevelopment
potential, if any.
31
02 -- Valuation of SPEcific Assets -- Part 2 -- Real Estate
2.6.3 Cost AppROAch
The cost appROAch is typically applied in market value appraisals when the subject is a sPEcial-use proPErty
whose income-generating potential is not the primary value driver (e.g., place of worship, public recreation centre,
etc.) The cost appROAch is also helpful as a SECondary valuation appROAch or a test of reasonableness when
used alongside the income appROAch and/or direct comparison appROAch, particularly in cases involving newly
constructed proPErties.
In short, the cost appROAch arrives at an estimate of market value by taking the sum of a proPErty's vacant land
value and the depreciated value of its improvements. An appraiser estimates the value of improvements using
one of two techniques, replacement cost or reproduction cost, while also considering depreciation arising from
physical deterioration, functional obsolescence, and external obsolescence at the valuation date. Difficulties
obtaining reliable vacant land values and replacement costs, compounded by challenges in estimating all forms
of depreciation, make the cost appROAch difficult to apply in practice. Further, this appROAch rarely reflects the
thought process of market participants. Despite these challenges, the cost appROAch provides market evidence
that may help form market value opinions when the availability or reliability of other data sources is inadequate or
questionable.
Valuators should keep the following considerations regarding the application of the cost appROAch in mind:
* Comparable vacant land transactions rarely exist in fully built-out areas, which causes the appraiser to
estimate the market value of the subject's land (as vacant) using other techniques, such as market extraction
or allocation;
* Replacement cost or reproduction cost estimates and any amounts included for contractor's profit and
entrepreneurial profit must be market-based and applied consistently when estimating costs for the subject
proPErty and all comparable transactions; and
* An appraiser's opinion on a proPErty's curable depreciation, curable functional obsolescence, incurable
physical deterioration, and incurable functional obsolescence requires sufficient research and analyses and the
application of professional judgement.
2.7 Assessment vs. Appraisal
Valuators often receive municipal proPErty assessment notices instead of indePEndent proPErty appraisals
when a proPErty's market value is required as part of their business valuation engagement. Although the terms
assessment and appraisal are often used interchangeably, they are distinct opinions of value. Valuators considering
the suitability or appropriateness of relying on a proPErty assessment instead of a proPErty appraisal prepared
sPEcifically for their purpose and intended use should note that:
* ProPErty assessments are prepared on a mass appraisal basis, with cost and timing constraints, legislative
requirements (e.g., appraisal ratio studies), and assessment policies influencing the determination of market
value assessments. In some cases, a proPErty's market value assessment may be materially higher or lower
than what the proPErty's market value estimate would be if it were appraised;
* ProPErty assessments have valuation dates established by legislation, whereas appraisals can have one or
more valuation dates based on the purpose and intended use of the valuation;
* ProPErty assessments are prepared for the sole purpose of fairly and equitably distributing municipal proPErty
taxes among proPErty owners, whereas appraisals are prepared for various intended uses; and
* ProPErty assessments relate to fee simple proPErty rights, although legislation and assessment policies
typically exclude PErsonal proPErty (e.g., furniture, fixtures, and equipment) and intangible assets from
assessment. Conversely, proPErty appraisals can involve any ownership interest in the real proPErty, which may
include the value of PErsonal proPErty and intangible assets.

2.8 Additional Considerations
Valuators encounter various scenarios where the estimated value of real proPErty materially impacts their opinion
of value, whether this PErtains to an oPErating business or a holding company. Valuators should keep the following
additional considerations regarding proPErty valuations in mind:
* A partial interest discount may or may not apply in an appraisal dePEnding on its purpose and intended
use, which may or may not align with the requirements of a sPEcific business valuation engagement. Partial
interest discounts may or may not be apparent in the market. Accordingly, valuators should ensure there is no
omission or double counting regarding discounts for control or marketability whenever these circumstances
arise (i.e., minority ownership interests);
* Real estate agents and brokers often provide a comparative market analysis to solicit listings for sale on the
oPEn market; however, regulatory bodies generally limit the use of these comparative market analyses to
complete a sale transaction. In other words, regulators ordinarily prohibit real estate agents and brokers from
issuing comparative market analyses for any other use (e.g., dispute resolution, financial reporting, financing,
etc.). Conversely, real estate appraisers must be indePEndent and free of conflicts that may impair their
objectivity, in addition to satisFYing their professional obligations based on the professional reporting standard
selected for their valuation;
* Real estate appraisals may require the use of hypothetical conditions and extraordinary assumptions when the
purpose and intended use of the valuation reflect circumstances that do not exist on the valuation date (e.g.,
the proPErty is appraised "as-complete," meaning the improvements are valued as though complete as of the
date of valuation ). Valuators should ensure these critical assumptions align with the purpose and intended
use of their business valuation engagement;
* Real estate appraisers rarely segregate the contributory value of land and building improvements when
estimating a proPErty's market value. Rather, a proPErty's market value is ordinarily presented as a single value
without allocation among land and building/site improvements. If a valuator requires an opinion of market
value on only the land component of a proPErty, the valuator should sPEcifically instruct the appraiser to
provide this market value opinion at the outset of the engagement;
* A portfolio discount or portfolio premium may apply in circumstances where a business owns interests in a
portfolio of proPErties. ProPErties appraised on a portfolio basis may be valued after considering the impact,
if any, these tyPEs of premiums/discounts may have; however, valuators should ensure no omissions or double
counting occurs concerning any premiums/discounts in a real estate appraisal when these opinions are used in
their business valuation report;
* Valuators applying the liquidation appROAch to value should confirm that any opinion of value relied on reflects
the appropriate definition of value, including adequate consideration of the proposed terms of sale under the
forced or orderly liquidation process;
* Land registry systems allow real estate appraisers to research past transactions involving proPErties, with
professional reporting standards mandating appraisers disclose current or PEnding transactions and prior
transactions involving the subject proPErty three years preceding the valuation date. Valuators concerned
about the potential for fraud can review these appraisal reporting disclosures to uncover past transaction
activity that may warrant further research; and
* A proPErty's highest and best use determines whether a residential or commercial appraiser should appraise
it. For example, a residential appraiser may value an acreage or small farm if future development of the land
is unlikely; however, acreages and farms located along a municipality's outskirts and within the path of urban
development should be valued by a commercial appraiser when the highest and best use of these proPErties
is future urban development.

Appraisal Institute, The Dictionary of Real Estate Appraisal, 6th ed. Chicago: Appraisal Institute, 2015.
Above-the-line exPEnse An exPEnse that is recorded "above" the net oPErating income line in a reconstructed
oPErating statement typically develoPEd for valuation purposes and therefore is
considered part of the total oPErating exPEnses for the proPErty.
Appraisal ratio study
A comparison of the ratio of an assessor's market value estimates to actual sale prices;
used to investigate the extent to which the assessor's market value estimates conform
to statutory requirements and assessment policy.
Assemblage
The combining of two or more parcels, usually but not necessarily contiguous, into
one ownership or use; the process that may create plottage value.
Below-the-line exPEnse An exPEnse that is recorded "below" the net oPErating income line in a reconstructed
oPErating statement typically develoPEd for valuation purposes and therefore is not
considered part of the total oPErating exPEnses for the proPErty.
Contractor's profit
The amount by which the fee received by a contractor for work PErformed exceeds
the total direct costs of materials, labour, and overhead.
Contract rent
The actual rental income sPEcified in a lease.
Curable depreciation
Items of physical deterioration or functional obsolescence that are economically
feasible to cure. Curing an item of depreciation is economically feasible if the cost to
cure is equal to or less than the anticipated increase in the value of the proPErty that
would result after curing the depreciation.
Curable functional
An element of depreciation; a curable defect caused by a flaw in the structure,
obsolescence
materials, or design, which can be practically and economically corrected.
Deficit rent
The amount by which market rent exceeds contract rent at the time of the appraisal;
created by a lease favourable to the tenant, resulting in a positive leasehold, and
may reflect uninformed or unusually motivated parties, sPEcial relationships, inferior
management, a lease executed in a weaker rental market, or concessions agreed to by
the parties.
Effective rent
Total base rent, or minimum rent stipulated in a lease, over the sPEcified lease term
minus rent concessions; the rent that is effectively paid by a tenant net of financial
concessions provided by a landlord.
Entrepreneurial profit
A market-derived figure that represents the amount an entrepreneur receives for their
contribution to a project and risk; the difference between the total cost of proPErty
(cost of development) and its market value (proPErty value after completion), which
represents the entrepreneur's comPEnsation for the risk and exPErtise associated with
development. An entrepreneur is motivated by the prosPEct of future value enhancement
(i.e., the entrepreneurial incentive). An entrepreneur who successfully creates value
through new development, expansion, renovation, or an innovative change of use is
rewarded by entrepreneurial profit. Entrepreneurs may also fail and suffer losses.
Excess rent
The amount by which contract rent exceeds market rent at the time of the appraisal;
created by a lease favourable to the landlord (lessor) and may reflect unusual

that it would be willing to bid.
Incurable functional
An element of depreciation; a defect caused by a deficiency or suPEradequacy in the

reflect an equivalent, stable annual income.
Stabilized occupancy
The occupancy of a proPErty that would be exPEcted at a particular point in time,
considering its relative comPEtitive strength and supply and demand conditions at
the time, and presuming it is priced at market rent and has had reasonable market

3.1
Introduction to Blockchain Technology
In technical terms, a blockchain is a distributed digital ledger that uses cryptography to SECurely and PErmanently
record transactions without the involvement of trusted third-party facilitators or intermediaries. In lay terms, a
blockchain is simply a database. Each new block contains records or transactions along with a unique link to the
previous block. Once newly proposed records or transactions are verified by network participants, the block is
cryptographically "chained" to its predecessor, effectively creating an immutable ledger shared by the entire network.
Exhibit 3.1: Basic Components of a Blockchain
Blockchain is a database
Records are bundled together into blocks and added to the chain one after another.
Its basic parts include:
A Record
A Block
The Chain
Can be any information
(i.e., an individual transaction)

A bundle of records
All the blocks linked together
While blockchains can be public (analogous to the internet) or private (analogous to an intranet), the focus of this
SECtion is on public blockchains. Three principal technologies fuse together to facilitate blockchain technology.
Each of these is discussed in more detail below.
3.1.1 Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)
DLT is a public database of records simultaneously maintained by all network participants. Corporate and financial
record-keeping has traditionally been maintained by institutions and governments in centralized computer
databases, making it inherently susceptible to hacking and misuse. Blockchain uses DLT to decentralize recordkeeping by ensuring that every participant maintains an identical copy of the blockchain's complete ledger, which
is publicly accessible by anyone at any time. This ensures transparency while eliminating the need for a central
authority to process transactions and maintain records.
3.1.2 Cryptography
Cryptography, the science of SECure communication, is used to protect the identity of blockchain participants
while still allowing a public record of transactions on the blockchain. Most blockchains require that each
participant have two different keys, a public key and a private key, which are linked via mathematical algorithms.
A hypothetical example (illustrated in Exhibit 3.2) of the transmission process using public and private keys is as
follows:
1. Sender initiates a transfer of bitcoin to Recipient. The transfer is encrypted and transmitted using the
Recipient's public key (akin to sending an email to an email address).
40
03 -- Valuation of SPEcific Assets -- Part 3 -- Blockchain and Cryptoassets
2. Recipient decrypts the transmission using their private key (akin to entering the password to an email
inbox to access messages received). The private key used for decryption must correspond to the
Recipient's public key; otherwise, the transmission will fail.

3.1.3 Consensus Mechanisms
Consensus mechanisms provide a means for disPErsed network participants to agree on the transactions to be
included in the public ledger, without an administering body to oversee the process. The two common consensus
models used in the cryptoasset space today are proof of work and proof of stake.
3.1.3.1 Proof of Work (PoW)
Under a PoW model, computers PErform "work" by attempting to solve complex mathematical puzzles. The fIRSt
computer to solve the puzzle must provide the answer (or the "proof of work") to other network participants for
verification. Once verified, a new block can be added to the blockchain and the digital ledgers of all participants.
Bitcoin is an example of a blockchain governed by the PoW protocol.
3.1.3.2 Proof of Stake (PoS)
Under a PoS model, the validator of a transaction and creator of a new block is chosen deterministically dePEnding
on its investment or stake in the particular cryptoasset's network. For example, some blockchains choose a
validator randomly, whereas for others the choice is based on the quantity and age of the validator's investment in
the network. Under the latter method, "older" vintages are increasingly likely to forge upcoming blocks. Tezos is an
example of blockchain governed by the PoS protocol.
The foundational technologies underlying blockchain -- DLT, cryptography, and consensus mechanisms -- each
allow for the displacement of trusted third parties and the construction of a shared ledger that becomes selfaudited and nearly impossible to unwind.
3.2 Business Use Cases of Blockchain
According to a report by PwC, blockchain has the potential to add US$1.76 trillion to the global economy and
enhance 40 million jobs globally by 2030.1 The potential applications of blockchain's sequencing technology are
innumerable. Blockchain is exPEcted to impact many SECtors, including manufacturing, logistics, fashion, finance,
health care, technology, and government services.

03 -- Valuation of SPEcific Assets -- Part 3 -- Blockchain and Cryptoassets
The following SECtions discuss several of blockchain's use cases, illustrating how the technology has already
improved the offerings of many businesses simply by streamlining the creation, storage, and dissemination of
potentially sensitive information over a decentralized network.
3.2.1 Payments and Financial Institutions
The payments and finance industries have the potential to be fundamentally revolutionized by blockchain.
For example, in PErhaps the most familiar application of blockchain and cryptoassets, cryptocurrencies like
Bitcoin are essentially being used as a digital currency for payments (as an alternative to fiat currencies issued
by governments and central banks). However, despite their increased adoption in recent years,2 the use of
cryptocurrencies as a payment mechanism is still largely unregulated in many jurisdictions, and in others it is
illegal.
To provide some legitimacy to digital currencies, many central banks around the world have been exploring how
state-issued digital currencies can contemporize the national payments infrastructure. The Bank of Canada, for
example, is exploring whether and to what extent central bank digital currency can replace or supplement physical
cash while optimizing clearing oPErations between the central and commercial banking system and improving
sPEed and reliability to end users.3
The financial SECtor is also investigating how stable coins (i.e., cryptoassets backed by fiat currency or some other
real-world asset) can be used to modernize cross-border payment infrastructure, which has historically been
plagued by high remittance fees and long delays.
3.2.2 Supply Chain Management
Blockchain technology is currently being used by many businesses to improve supply chain management.
It has been used very effectively to prove the origin of goods such as fresh produce, pharmaceuticals, raw
manufacturing materials, and gemstones. As goods move through the supply chain, blockchain can be used as a
tracking mechanism by creating a unique and IRReversible identifier for each item or batch that includes details of
the batch's attributes (e.g., origin, insPEctions, environmental compliance, deliveries, etc.). The unique identifier
generated can then be used to identiFY counterfeit or non-compliant products or automatically generate and
disseminate warnings of product quality deficiencies, thereby potentially mitigating a company's risk of losses.

42
03 -- Valuation of SPEcific Assets -- Part 3 -- Blockchain and Cryptoassets
For example, Walmart has partnered with IBM to create a "food safety" blockchain in which each participant that
handles food on its journey from farm to table must digitally sign the blockchain. In the event of food recall, the
identification, tracing, and quarantine of affected batches is quick and precise.5
3.2.3 Smart Contracts
A smart contract is a computer protocol intended to facilitate, veriFY, or enforce a contract on the blockchain
without third-party intervention.6 Effectively, many of the terms and conditions typically included in a legally
enforceable contract can be programmed into a smart contract, making it possible to automatically trigger
payment if certain conditions are met or, alternatively, halt payment if conditions are not satisfied or a dispute
arises.
Some benefits of smart contracts include the streamlining of the contracting and dispute resolution processes,
which can save time and lower costs for transacting parties:
* It is not necessary to execute a smart contract in PErson (i.e., encrypted digital signatures required to
participate on most blockchains replace the need for in-PErson execution); and
* When a smart contract self-executes, an audit trail is automatically generated, removing the need for ongoing
third-party monitoring and reporting. This may potentially reduce additional costs, such as the cost of
litigation.
YellowHeart is a real-world example of the use of smart contracts in the entertainment industry. It is a blockchainbased ticketing and blockchain collectibles platform, which harnesses the power of smart contracts in an attempt
to reduce improprieties in the SECondary sale of concert and event tickets.7 The smart contract can sPEciFY the
exact number and location of seats available, the minimum age requirement for entry, the original ticket price of
each seat, the maximum price, and the number of times a ticket may be resold,8 thereby regulating the exorbitant
pricing and scalping activities that normally take place in this market.
Blockchain and smart contracts may also make it possible for artists and entertainers to be immediately
comPEnsated for use of their innovative works without having to navigate through a labyrinth of contracts and
reporting.
Valuators involved in contract disputes may increasingly see reference to smart contracts in their work.
3.3 Introduction to Cryptoassets
Cryptoassets are the native digital assets used or transacted on a blockchain, "which utilize cryptography, PEerto-PEer networking, and a public ledger to regulate the creation of new units, veriFY transactions, and SECure the
transactions without the intervention of any middleman."9
Cryptoassets can initially be classified based on their designation as either digital coins or digital tokens, based on
where they reside -- coins reside on their own, indePEndent blockchain, whereas tokens reside on top of another
blockchain. For example, a bitcoin is a "coin" that resides on the Bitcoin network.10 A filecoin is a "token" that
functions on the Ethereum blockchain11 along with hundreds of other tokens.

Coins and tokens have many different functions. They can be used as a means of digital payment (i.e., payment
coins/tokens), a digital ticket or "grant of access" to a particular product or service (i.e., utility tokens), or a digital
representation of a traditional asset (i.e., asset/SECurity token). An overview of the bROAd cryptoasset taxonomy is

platform for smart contract, dApps, etc.
Example: Ether (Blockchain: Ethereum)
Use Case: Access to product or service
Example: Filecoin (Blockchain: Ethereum)
Asset / SECurity Token
Use Case: Tokenized version of a traditional asset
Example: Documo (Blockchain: Ethereum)
Other Token
Use Case: New, modified, hybrid
Example: Neumark (Blockchain: Ethereum)
To recap, one of the fundamental differences between coins and tokens is that a coin resides on its own native
blockchain, whereas a token resides on another blockchain. The tyPE of cryptoasset may influence the applicable
valuation appROAch, as discussed in further detail in SECtion 3.6.
3.4 Taxation -- Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) PErsPEctive
In 2019, the CRA published the "Guide for Cryptocurrency Users and Tax Professionals," which consolidated the
CRA's views on the Canadian taxation of cryptocurrency. The CRA adopts the position that a cryptocurrency
(sometimes also referred to as a cryptoasset or altcoin) is a digital asset that "works as a medium of exchange for
goods and services between the parties who agree to use it."12

cryptocurrency-guide.html.

03 -- Valuation of SPEcific Assets -- Part 3 -- Blockchain and Cryptoassets
The guide explicitly states that despite its nomenclature, cryptocurrency is not considered legal tender in Canada
and therefore is not afforded the same protections as fiat currency. For example, cryptocurrency held in a digital
wallet is not protected in the same way as a bank account at a Canadian bank is. Similarly, Canadian businesses are
not required to accept cryptocurrency as a form of payment in the same way they are with legal tender.
In general, the CRA treats a cryptocurrency as a commodity in the hands of a Canadian taxpayer for purposes of
the Income Tax Act. This means that any income (or loss) from cryptocurrency transactions is treated as business
income or a capital gain (or a business loss/capital loss), dePEnding on the taxpayer's circumstances. (TyPEs of
income and their tax consequences were introduced in Level II, Module 2.)
If a cryptocurrency is used to pay for goods or services, the CRA treats this as a barter transaction (i.e., two
parties exchanging goods or services and carrying out that exchange without using legal currency). Example 3.4
illustrates the tax implications that typically arise in this situation.
3.4.1 Acquisitions of Cryptocurrency
The acquisition of cryptocurrency from a cryptoasset trading platform (also called CTP or cryptoasset exchange)
using fiat currency is generally not a taxable event until the cryptocurrency is exchanged or otherwise disposed
of by the taxpayer. However, the initial acquisition sets the cost base of the cryptocurrency, which is a factor in
determining the ultimate tax liability. If a taxpayer holds more than one tyPE of cryptocurrency in a digital wallet,
each tyPE of cryptocurrency is considered to be a separate digital asset and must be valued separately for tax
purposes (similar to individual stocks or bonds held in a brokerage account).
In the event that a cryptocurrency is acquired through mining activities, the tax treatment will dePEnd on whether
the taxpayer is mining as a business activity or as a PErsonal hobby (which is decided on a case-by-case basis by
the CRA). If the taxpayer is mining as a business activity, the CRA adopts the position that the miner is subject
to business income tax at the time the cryptocurrency is earned. The CRA considers mining to be a "service"
provided and views the mined cryptocurrency earned as the comPEnsation for the provision of services. In these
cases, the CRA applies its position regarding barter transactions in determining the amount that is required to be
included in income at the time the cryptocurrency is earned.
Similarly, the acquisition of a cryptocurrency as consideration for the provision of any other goods or services, or
as comPEnsation for some other right of payment, is governed by the CRA's position regarding barter transactions.
Example 3.1: Tax Implications of Bitcoin (BTC) Mining -- Business
Activity vs. Hobby
Josee is a computer science teacher who has mined one BTC as a hobby. On the day she mines her BTC, it is
trading at a price of $40,000. On the same day, Raul, who has hundreds of mining rigs set up in an oPEration
deemed to be a business, mines a BTC (which also trades at $40,000 at the time of mining). Both parties later sell
their BTC at $60,000. The following table illustrates the difference in tax treatment, assuming a marginal business
income tax rate of 35% for individuals and businesses:

Adjusted cost base of single BTC at
$nil
$40,000

45
03 -- Valuation of SPEcific Assets -- Part 3 -- Blockchain and Cryptoassets
3.4.2 Dispositions of Cryptocurrency
The guide states that any time a disposition occurs, the taxpayer will realize taxable income (or a loss). The CRA
considers the following events to give rise to tax consequences:
* Sale or gift of a cryptocurrency;
* Trading or exchanging cryptocurrency, including disposing of one cryptocurrency to get another
cryptocurrency;
* Conversion of cryptocurrency to government-issued currency, such as Canadian dollars; or
* Use of cryptocurrency to buy goods or services.
The buying and selling of cryptocurrencies can generally be regarded as being on capital account unless, as
mentioned above, it is carried out in the context of a business buying and selling such cryptocurrencies.
Example 3.2: Tax Implications of Sale of Bitcoin
From Example 3.1, assume that both Josee and Raul sell their single BTC at $60,000, earning a $20,000 pre-tax
profit relative to the price at which it was mined.
Josee
Raul
Taxable capital gain on sale of BTC $30,000 [($60,000 - $nil) x 50%]

n/a
$20,000
Tax owing on sale of BTC
$10,500 ($30,000 x 35%)
$7,000 ($20,000 x 35%)
Example 3.3: Trading One Cryptoasset for Another Cryptoasset
Abe holds 2.5 BTC (originally purchased for C$30,700, with a fair market value today of C$116,000) in his digital
wallet and converts it to 30.3 ether (fair market value of C$116,000).
Required:
How is this transaction treated for tax purposes?
Solution:
* The transaction is considered disposition and the CRA categorizes this as a barter transaction because no
legal currency is being used in the transaction.
* Proceeds: Value of cryptocurrency given up, converted into CAD (exchange rate at time of trade).
* Cost base: Cost of cryptocurrency given up converted into CAD (exchange rate at time of initial acquisition).
* Tax liability: Proceeds of $116,000 less cost base of $30,700 = $85,300 capital gain taxed at 50%.
3.4.3 Accepting Currency as a Form of Payment
If a business accepts cryptocurrency as a form of payment (i.e., cryptocurrency received by vendor is recognized
as business income), there is potential for any increase in the fair market value of the cryptocurrency held by
the business to be taxed as full business income rather than on account of capital when the business eventually
disposes of the cryptocurrency.
46
03 -- Valuation of SPEcific Assets -- Part 3 -- Blockchain and Cryptoassets
Example 3.4: Accepting Currency as a Form of Payment
Ballmark Games is a digital gaming company providing PEer-to-PEer combat games. On Monday, when BTC is
trading at $40,000, the company receives one BTC as a form of payment for game access. By Friday, the price of
BTC has increased to $50,000, and the company decides to sell the BTC for cash. The company is thus taxed for
the increase in the value of the BTC that it held from Monday to Friday ($10,000) at its ordinary business income
tax rate.
The onus is on the taxpayer to maintain all the necessary documents for reporting their tax liability related to
cryptocurrencies, including receipts of purchase or transfer of cryptocurrency, the value of the cryptocurrency in
Canadian dollars at the time of the transaction, the digital wallet records and cryptocurrency addresses, exchange
records, and records of accounting and legal costs. If the taxpayer is involved in business activities relating to
cryptoassets, there will likely be greater reporting requirements. For example, miners are required to maintain
receipts for their equipment and electricity costs for tax purposes.
3.5 Investment Purposes -- Canadian SECurities Administrators (CSA)
PErsPEctive
In Canada, cryptoassets are primarily regulated under SECurities law. Since 2017, the CSA and the Investment
Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada have released various publications providing guidance on topics such
as cryptoasset offerings (i.e., initial coin offerings and initial token offerings), trading platforms and exchanges as
related to SECurities legislation, and disclosure requirements applicable to reporting issuers dealing in cryptoassets.
In Canada, SECurities legislation requires reporting issuers to disclose the material risks affecting their business
and, where practicable, the financial impacts of such risks. For cryptoasset reporting issuers, the CSA highlighted
the ongoing risk of loss and/or theft related to these cryptoassets and the importance of custody controls adopted
by these issuers to safeguard against this risk. When valuing businesses that hold cryptoassets, valuators should
be aware of these risks and their potential impact on a conclusion of value. Other risks that valuators should be
aware of in a valuation setting include the availability and/or cost of electricity, potential declines in the price of
cryptoassets, and decreased rewards for mining a particular cryptoasset.
3.6 Valuation
3.6.1 Valuation Framework
Parallels have been drawn between some of the cryptoasset valuation theory that has emerged and existing
valuation theory, particularly in relation to the valuation of intellectual proPErty:13
* There is a pronounced similarity between certain characteristics of cryptoassets and intellectual proPErty --
both are non-monetary assets that lack physical substance but grant rights and economic benefits to their
owners; and14
* Certain cryptoasset valuation appROAches are analogous to the three appROAches commonly used in traditional
valuation -- the cost, income, and market appROAches.15 See Exhibit 3.5 below.
Given the advanced status of intellectual proPErty valuation appROAches, these identified parallels may help
alleviate some apprehension when embarking on cryptoasset valuation.

3.6.2 Cost of Production AppROAch
The cost of production appROAch suggests that the cost of producing or mining a cryptoasset may provide an
indicator of its value. It postulates that those responsible for the generation of digital assets are incented by the
exPEctation of profits and will continue to produce (or mine) only as long as the variable cost of production is less
than or equal to the market price of the mined coin.16
This appROAch aligns with the cost appROAch from intellectual proPErty valuation, under which a valuator estimates
the cost to reconstruct the subject asset assuming that "no prudent buyer would pay more for intellectual
proPErty rights than the cost to construct a substitute of equal desirability and utility."17
While the cost of production appROAch is, PErhaps, one of the most straightforward cryptoasset valuation
methodologies, valuators should be aware of certain limitations:
* Not all cryptoassets are "produced" or "mined" and, therefore, measuring the costs of production is not always
possible;18
* The proposed model focuses on the costs of electricity (the primary cost incurred in digital asset mining) but
does not consider transaction fees, another important component of miners' total comPEnsation;19 and
* The proposed model does not consider the non-monetary incentives of miners. For example, some miners
may be willing to oPErate at a loss to develop and maintain the network because of their philosophical belief
in an unregulated, transparent financial system.20

SPEcifically, there is limited applicability of the cost of production appROAch to tokens and coins that adopt the proof of stake
consensus mechanism.
19 This model considers the marginal cost of production and does not include consideration for fixed cost for start-up, such as hardware.

03 -- Valuation of SPEcific Assets -- Part 3 -- Blockchain and Cryptoassets
3.6.3 Equation of Exchange AppROAch
The equation of exchange appROAch,21 frequently applied in valuing utility tokens,22 resembles the classic
discounted cash flow method. Under this appROAch, a utility token is considered to be the currency of the micROEconomy it supports and its value is estimated using an identity from monetary economics (i.e., Money x Velocity =
Price x Quantity).
The appROAch requires the valuator to estimate, among other things, the total size of the market and the subject
cryptoasset's share of the market, prices for the provisioned good or service, and a discount rate to convert future
value to present value.
The equation of exchange appROAch shares many characteristics with traditional cash flow valuation appROAches,
which may help ease the transition to cryptoassets. However, valuators should be aware of certain critical nuances
in its application:
* Under this appROAch, there is a fundamental shift away from an analysis of future exPEcted cash flows and
toward an analysis of future exPEcted network value;23 and
* Selection of valuation model inputs such as the discount rate may be esPEcially difficult because of the limited
empirical evidence available. The risk, of course, is that a valuation model built on a multitude of unverified
assumptions may result in "garbage" output.24
3.7 Network Value to Transactions (NVT) Ratio
In the context of cryptoassets, a relative or market-based valuation appROAch requires the valuator to "identiFY a
value metric from one [asset], and then use it to value another [asset]."25
The NVT ratio, a market-based appROAch, relies on a new cryptoasset-sPEcific metric, daily transaction volume.
The intention of this appROAch is to use the daily transaction volume of one cryptoasset to impute the network
value of another "comparable" cryptoasset. This method relies on the publicly available market pricing and volume
information derived from cryptoasset trading platforms and other data aggregators.
The components of the NVT ratio are as follows:
* The numerator, the cryptoasset's network value, is akin to a public company's market capitalization (i.e., the
total market value of all coins or tokens in circulation for the sPEcific cryptoasset); and
* The denominator, daily transaction volume, measures the cryptoasset's on-chain transaction volumes.26
The NVT ratio, a popular cryptoasset market-based valuation appROAch, may provide a methodology to evaluate
or test the fundamental value of cryptoassets. However, at present, there are a number of limitations of which
valuators should be mindful:
21 Burniske, Chris. "Cryptoasset Valuations." Medium, September 2017.
22 Dowlat, Sherwin, and Michael Hodapp. Cryptoasset Market Coverage Initiation: Valuation. Satis Group, 2018.
23
If a utility token is "a scarce asset that serves as a gateway for cash flows that come in and out of a network," it follows that "as long
as the network requires all or some internal transactions to be conducted in its native token, the token can be designed in such a
way as to tie its value to the growth of the network." Anisimov, Andrei. "Utility Token: a new value-capture mechanism." Medium,
April 2018.
24 The application of the equation of exchange appROAch is beyond the scoPE of this course. If you are interested in learning more about
this appROAch can, see SECtion 6.3 and ApPEndix D of "Decrypting Crypto: An Introduction to Cryptoassets and a Study of Select
Valuation AppROAches" by Tara K. Singh and Tylar St. John.

Ige, Lanre. "Cryptoasset Valuation Techniques." Medium, March 2018, https://medium.com/mosaic-network-blog/cryptoassetvaluation-techniques-part-1-23f3188c7d96.
26 In contrast to the price/earnings ratio where the denominator represents a company's earnings, many cryptoassets do not generate
cash flows. Therefore, the daily transaction volume is used as a proxy for earnings and represents the value flowing through the
network on a given day. Ige, Lanre. "Cryptoasset Valuation Techniques." Medium, March 2018, https://medium.com/mosaic-networkblog/cryptoasset-valuation-techniques-part-1-23f3188c7d96.
49
03 -- Valuation of SPEcific Assets -- Part 3 -- Blockchain and Cryptoassets
* The usefulness of market-based cryptoasset valuation analysis may be limited since drawing meaningful
inferences hinges on having access to reliable empirical data, which, given the relative immaturity of the
cryptoasset industry, may not yet be available; and
* When using traditional market-based valuation appROAches to value a business, it is often challenging to
identiFY companies, transactions, or assets that are reasonably comparable to the subject. The same challenge
exists with cryptoassets. There are many dimensions of comparability between different cryptoassets, which
may render one cryptoasset difficult to compare to another. Examples of differences between cryptoassets
include differences in the maturity of a cryptoasset, the intended use of the asset (i.e., whether it is bROAdly
accepted as a method of exchange), liquidity of the asset, and other technical nuances among assets. Such
differences may render a relative valuation metric unsuitable for application to the subject cryptoasset being
valued. This challenge is similar to a traditional business valuation where guideline public companies are used
and where a relatively illiquid public company may imply a valuation metric (i.e., enterprise value/revenue) that
is much less meaningful when compared against more actively traded comparables.
3.8 Applicability to CBVs Now and in the Future
The three valuation appROAches examined in this module are still in development and, given the various
noted limitations, are likely to continue to undergo significant refinement as the cryptoasset market matures.
Nevertheless, their resPEctive contributions to the cryptoasset valuation discourse has been significant.
SPEcifically, they highlight a set of new and important factors that valuators should consider:
* As with traditional valuation, there is no universal cryptoasset valuation methodology; and
* The applicability of a valuation methodology will dePEnd on the features of a particular cryptoasset and other
case-sPEcific factors.

04 -- Valuation of Financial Instruments-- Part 1 -- Debt Instruments
4.1 Overview of Financial Instruments
A financial instrument is a contract involving any kind of monetary value between two parties. Typically, it gives rise
to a financial asset of one party and a financial liability or equity instrument of another party. Generally, a financial
instrument can be traded, and there are established markets to facilitate trades (such as the bond market).
Financial instruments can be loosely divided into two bROAd categories:
* Debt instruments, whereby the value of the instrument is defined in terms of cash. An example is a promissory
note, in which the contract defines the monetary value one party owes to the other. A debt instrument is also
known as a fixed-income SECurity, terminology commonly used in the capital market.
* Derivative instruments, whereby the value of the instrument is derived from and dePEndent on the value of an
underlying asset. The underlying asset can be a stock, a commodity, an interest rate, or an index. A derivative
instrument can be structured as a right but not the obligation to execute the contract. Derivative instruments
will be discussed in more detail in Module 5.
Debt and derivative instruments are common categories of traded financial instruments, in which the terms of
each contract are somewhat standardized to facilitate trades. Financial instruments can also be highly customized
to suit the needs of the transacting parties, such as contingent consideration. This category of customized
financial instruments will be explored in Module 6.
4.1.1 Common Situations Giving Rise to a Valuation of Financial Instruments
Valuation of financial instruments may be required for financial reporting, tax planning or structuring, litigation
support, and transaction purposes. Below are some of the common situations that give rise to a valuation of
financial instruments:
* In estimating the equity value of a business under the income appROAch or market appROAch,1 where the
stated interest rate of a debt instrument does not reflect the prevailing market rates, either due to a change
in the company's creditworthiness or a change in market conditions, and as such the face value of the debt
instrument is not an acceptable approximation of its fair market value.
* In adopting the adjusted net book value method, where an adjustment to fair market value is necessary for all
assets and liabilities (including financial instruments such as debt and derivative instruments).
* In business combinations for accounting purposes, where the purchase price consists of contingent consideration.
* In a purchase price allocation for accounting purposes, where individual assets and liabilities (including
financial instruments such as debt and derivative instruments) are measured at the estimated fair value at the
date of acquisition.
* For financial reporting purposes, where the company owns financial instruments (such as debt and derivative
instruments) that are required to be measured at fair value on each reporting date, in accordance with
the accounting standards. Some examples of financial instruments that are commonly valued for financial
reporting purposes are as follows:
* Debt instruments that are required or elected to be measured at fair value;
* Debt instruments with optionality whereby the option(s) is classified as equity and is required to be valued
and reported separately (also known as the debt-equity-split); and
* Stock option or equity comPEnsation for employees and non-employees.
1
For clarity, this refers to estimating an enterprise value using the income appROAch or market appROAch, then deducting the value of
net debt to arrive at the equity value of a business.
53
04 -- Valuation of Financial Instruments-- Part 1 -- Debt Instruments
4.2 Characteristics of Debt Instruments
A debt instrument allows companies to borrow money from lenders and investors under defined terms.
For companies, debt instruments differ from common shares in a few ways:
* Debt instruments do not have ownership rights; and
* Payments of debt instruments, commonly in the form of interest and principal, are priority claims on the
company's earnings and assets, rather than the claim on residual cash flows of common shareholders.
Various other entities, such as government and infrastructure projects, may issue debt instruments to fund their
oPEration or development plans.
This SECtion discusses the characteristics of debt instruments. The fIRSt part follows the journey of issuing a debt
instrument, which covers the difference between a primary and SECondary market, as well as the difference between
a public and private debt. Next, the common characteristics of debt instruments are discussed: seniority, credit
rating, interest and principal payment structure, yield, optionality, and other salient terms. At last, SECuritized debt
instruments -- which are a pool of debt instruments instead of a single instrument -- are then briefly discussed.
4.2.1 Primary vs. SECondary Market
Similar to equity, there is a primary and SECondary market for debt instruments for both public and private debts.
The primary market is where debt instruments are fIRSt issued or sold to debtholders, and the issuer receives
the net proceeds. The SECondary market is where debt instruments are traded among the debtholders, and the
instrument's issuer doesn't take any part and doesn't share in the proceeds.
Typically, when a corporate entity (or "corporate") issues a public debt instrument, it's called a bond. To issue a bond,
the corporate appROAches an underwriting bank to indicate its interest in raising capital. It then typically engages a
credit rating agency to PErform an issuer credit rating and an issue-sPEcific credit rating for the contemplated bond
(refer to SECtion 4.2.5 for details on credit ratings). In the meantime, the underwriting bank prepares the required
legal documentation (along with the audited financial statements) for registration. The corporate then goes on a
"ROAdshow" and presents to potential investors. The purpose of the ROAdshow is twofold: fIRSt to market the bond,
and SECond to gauge interest and determine the price and maturity. Once sufficient interests are gathered, the
underwriting bank announces the issuance on the market and oPEns a "book" to record orders from the investors.
During the announcement day, the issuer may adjust the interest rate on the bond dePEnding on the orders
received from the investors. By the end of the announcement day, the book is closed and an allocation to each
investor is determined. The underwriting bank then informs the market of the closing of the bond issuance with
the instrument's finalized interest rate and maturity. Concurrently, the bond is listed on the SECondary market,
where details of the transactions and quotes are tracked by data vendors such as Bloomberg.
Typically, when a corporate borrows in private, most commonly from a bank, the instrument is called a loan.
To obtain a loan, the corporate appROAches a lending bank with a business plan to indicate the uses of the
borrowing and historical financial statements to demonstrate its ability to repay the loan. The lending bank
assesses the creditworthiness of the corporate and provides an indicative term sheet detailing the terms of the
loan, including the interest rate and principal amount. Once the corporate accepts the term sheet, the lending bank
PErforms due diligence on the borrower and engages attorneys to draft the credit agreement. Sometimes, when
the loan exceeds a certain size, the lending bank seeks a consortium to fund the loan and share the risk.
4.2.2 Public Debt vs. Private Debt
Public debt refers to a debt instrument that is issued or sold to a large number of institutional and retail investors
in a public auction or a dealer market. Common issuers of public debts are governments and their agencies (in the
form of treasury bills and bonds), provinces and municipalities (in the form of bonds), large corporates (in the form
of bonds), and financial institutions (in the form of bonds and SECuritized debts (refer to SECtion 4.2.10 for details
on SECuritization). For simplicity, this module refers to public debts as bonds.
54
04 -- Valuation of Financial Instruments-- Part 1 -- Debt Instruments
Prevailing market rates for bonds can be observed in the primary and SECondary markets. Since issuances in the
primary market can be sporadic, and the issuance date may not align with the intended valuation date, SECondary
market data are more commonly used as a benchmark. Generally, there are two tyPEs of SECondary market data:
(1) traded prices of individual bonds, and (2) a bond index that is an aggregate of selected bonds with certain
characteristics (for example, the Canadian Investment-Grade Bond Index).
Given the limited size of the Canadian bond market, analysts often look to the U.S. bond market for market data.
Exhibit 4.1 illustrates the composition of the Canadian and the U.S. bond markets, resPEctively, as well as the
market size and market share for each of the major issuers.

Private debt refers to a debt instrument issued or sold to a limited number of pre-qualified investors in private,
typically banks or non-bank institutional investors. Common issuers of private debts are mid-size companies and
corporates (in the form of loans) as well as individuals (in the form of consumer loans). For simplicity, this module
refers to private debts as loans.
Similar to bonds, prevailing market rates for loans can be observed in the primary and SECondary markets, mainly
in the United States, although they are not as liquid and transparent as bonds.
The selection of applicable market benchmarks are discussed further in SECtion 4.3.1.3.
4.2.3 Seniority
A company's capital structure refers to the composition of its debt and equity financing. In terms of the priority
of payment, debt ranks ahead of equity. Within the debt component, there can be varying levels of seniority,
dePEnding on the terms of the debt instrument.
Exhibit 4.2 presents an illustrative capital structure showing the ranking of various debt and equity instruments in
order of the priority of payment.

A SECured debt has a direct claim on certain assets pledged by the issuer. Within SECured debt, there is fIRSt-lien
debt, which is the highest-ranking debt. There could be a SECond-lien debt on the same assets, which ranks behind
the fIRSt-lien debt in the event of bankruptcy or liquidation.
On the other hand, unSECured debt only has a general (residual) claim on the issuer's assets. Within unSECured debt,
senior debt ranks ahead of subordinated debt. Subordinated debt refers to a class of obligations that are contractually
subordinated in ranking to all of the senior debts of the company, whether they are SECured or unSECured.
Generally, an inter-creditor agreement will be put in place between multiple classes of debtholders to govern the
sPEcific liquidation preferences and procedures for each class of holders in the event of bankruptcy or liquidation.
4.2.4 Other Salient Terms
A default occurs when a defined event of default occurs, typically giving the debtholders the right to demand
immediate repayment prior to the maturity date. Common events of default include:
* Non-payment of interest or principal;
* Breach of any covenants;
* Liquidation or bankruptcy of the issuer; or
* Change of control of the issuer.
Covenants are legally enforceable rules that the issuer and the debtholders agree on when issuing a debt
instrument. Affirmative covenants enumerate what the issuer is required to do. Generally, affirmative covenants
relate to the financial PErformance of the issuer. For example, an issuer may be required to maintain a minimum
debt servicing ratio as measured in the EBIT to interest ratio and a maximum leverage ratio as measured in the
debt to EBITDA ratio. Negative covenants, on the other hand, enumerate what the issuer is prohibited from doing.
For example, an issuer may be prohibited from pledging its assets as SECurity for additional borrowing.
56
04 -- Valuation of Financial Instruments-- Part 1 -- Debt Instruments
Representations and warranties are statements made by the issuer as formal confirmation that certain
assumptions or facts are accurate. For example, the issuer may make a representation that the projections
provided have been prepared in accordance with the accounting principles it uses in preparing its audited financial
statements.
A sinking fund provision is a requirement for the issuer to set aside cash in a custodial account each year to fund
the repayment of the debt by maturity. The sinking fund provision is a credit enhancement as it lowers the default
risk of the debt instrument. Sometimes, the issuer may use the sinking fund to repay parts of the debt prior to
maturity, called an accelerated sinking fund provision, as stipulated in the credit agreement with a prescribed
repayment schedule. The accelerated sinking fund provision is an embedded call option as it allows the issuer to
repay the debt earlier than the scheduled maturity.
4.2.5 Credit Rating
4.2.5.1 Credit Risk
Credit risk refers to the risk of an issuer failing to make full and timely interest and principal payments. Credit risk
can be further bifurcated into two components: (1) the probability of default, and (2) the loss given default, which
measures the severity of loss in the event of default. The product of the two is exPEcted loss, which in theory
equals credit risk.
ExPEcted loss = Probability of default x Loss given default
Loss given default = 1 - Recovery rate
Recovery rates can vary significantly by issuer and industry. They are influenced by the composition of an issuer's
capital structure, the economic and credit cycle when the default occurred, and the market's view of the prosPEcts
for the issuer and its industry.
4.2.5.2 TyPEs of Credit Rating
Credit rating is an opinion on credit risk at a point in time. Generally, there are two tyPEs of credit rating:
* An issuer credit rating is a rating assigned to an issuer, which expresses an opinion about the ability and
willingness of the issuer to meet its financial obligations in full and on time; and
* An issue-sPEcific credit rating is a rating assigned to a debt instrument, which expresses an opinion on the
likelihood of a default on the contractual payments and the loss severity in the event of default. An issue-sPEcific
credit rating is derived from the issuer credit rating, a process known as notching. It considers the ranking of the
debt instrument in the overall capital structure along with other factors that may impact loss severity.
4.2.5.3 Credit Rating Agencies
Credit ratings are typically PErformed by an indePEndent agency, such as S&P Global Ratings, Moody's, Fitch
Ratings, or DBRS Morningstar. Each agency develops and applies its methodology in measuring creditworthiness
and uses a sPEcific rating scale to publish its ratings opinions. Exhibit 4.3 shows the S&P rating scale and the
definition for each letter grade.

Credit rating is an efficient, widely recognized, and long-standing measure of credit risk, which facilitates the
process of issuing the transacting debt instruments. Credit rating is prevalent among public debts and optional
among private debts -- this partially explains the liquidity difference between the bond and the loan markets.
Typically, investors in private debts PErform credit ratings in-house using their own methodology.
4.2.5.4 Issuer Credit Rating Methodology
With resPEct to an issuer's rating methodology, there are different frameworks to account for the vast differences
in the nature of the issuers. Examples of frameworks include corporate, financial institution, sovereign, public
finance, infrastructure, project finance, and so on. This discussion focuses on the corporate framework, which is
most relevant for a business valuator.
Within the corporate framework, there are SECtor- and industry-sPEcific methodologies, either as a supplemental
methodology to a general corporate framework (as in S&P) or as a stand-alone methodology (as in Moody's).
Industry-sPEcific considerations capture the credit risk differences resulting from industry growth trends,
cyclicality, market structure, and comPEtition.
Exhibit 4.4 demonstrates each component of the S&P corporate rating methodology and outlines the stEPS to
PErform an issuer credit rating.

Overall, the methodology consists of a qualitative assessment of the business risk profile and a quantitative
assessment of the financial risk profile of the issuer.
Three factors are considered in assessing the business risk profile of an issuer: (1) country risk, (2) industry risk, and
(3) comPEtitive position. Country risk refers to the economic risk, institutional and governance effectiveness risk,
financial system risk, and payment culture risk in the countries in which a company oPErates. Industry risk refers to the
relative health and stability of the markets in which a company oPErates. Country risk and industry risk are considered
collectively in PErforming the issuer's corporate industry and country risk assessment. ComPEtitive position refers to
the issuer's readiness to take advantage of key industry drivers or mitigate associated risks compared to its PEer group.
Cash flow and leverage analysis are PErformed to assess the financial risk profile of an issuer. Examples of ratios
considered are funds from oPErations2 to debt and debt to EBITDA. Other supplementary ratios are considered to
address the differences in financial results due to industry and SECtor. For example, an issuer oPErating in a capitalintensive industry will have a higher EBITDA and FFO measure in comparison to other industry groups. Therefore,
a measure such as free oPErating cash flow3 may be more reflective of its cash flow.
The combined assessment of an issuer's business risk profile and financial risk profile leads to an anchor credit
rating. Various modifiers, such as capital structure, financial policy, management, and governance, may strengthen
or weaken the anchor credit rating. Once the stand-alone credit profile of the issuer is established, its relationship
with other entities such as a corporate group and government needs to be assessed.
If the issuer is a corporate group member, an assessment is PErformed on the likelihood of receiving extraordinary
group support, either positive or negative, that may strengthen or weaken the issuer's creditworthiness.
Suppose the issuer could, if under stress, benefit from extraordinary government support. In this case, an
assessment is made to determine the likelihood of receiving extraordinary government support that may
strengthen the issuer's creditworthiness.
A comparison to other issuers in the same industry group may also be PErformed before finalizing the issuer credit
rating.

59
04 -- Valuation of Financial Instruments-- Part 1 -- Debt Instruments
Generally, most rating agencies' methodologies share similar considerations of risks. The details as to how each
component is factored into the overall issuer credit rating differ. The mechanics of how a credit rating is PErformed
also differ.
Refer to Example 4.2 for an illustrative analysis of the issuer credit rating using the S&P corporate rating methodology.
4.2.5.5 Issue-SPEcific Credit Rating Methodology -- Notching
Based on the issuer credit rating, an issue-sPEcific credit rating can be assigned to each debt instrument based on
its priority of claim in the overall capital structure, which results in varying degrees of loss severity in the event of
default. The process of going from an issuer credit rating to an issue-sPEcific credit rating is known as notching.
At each level of the capital structure, all the debt instruments will receive the same issue-sPEcific credit rating
since they share the same priority of claims.
Exhibit 4.5 uses S&P's notching methodology for sPEculative-grade issuers as an example to explain the notching
process and how to go from an issuer credit rating to an issue-sPEcific credit rating for each debt instrument.
It demonstrates each component of the S&P notching methodology and outlines the stEPS to PErform an issuesPEcific credit rating.
Overall, the methodology assumes a hypothetical default by the issuer at some point in time. It estimates the loss
severity for each level of the capital structure owing by the issuer.

Particularly, an enterprise value is estimated at the point of hypothetical default, either as a going concern or
liquidated, known as the EV at emergence. The EV at emergence is then distributed to each level of the capital
structure in the order of priority of claim, a process known as the waterfall analysis. EV at emergence is the EV
available for distribution at the beginning of the waterfall analysis.
60
04 -- Valuation of Financial Instruments-- Part 1 -- Debt Instruments
At each level of the capital structure, four metrics are calculated:
* The exposure at default,4 which is the sum of debt claims outstanding at the point of hypothetical default;
* The recovered amount, which is the lesser of EAD or EV available for distribution;
* The recovery PErcentage, which is the PErcentage of recovered amount over exposure at default (Recovery
PErcentage = Recovered amount / EAD); and
* The residual EV, which is the beginning EV available for distribution minus the EAD.
The process rePEats for the next level of the capital structure, starting with residual EV as the EV available for
distribution.
Once the waterfall analysis is completed, the recovery PErcentage for each level of the capital structure is then
translated into a recovery rating that corresponds to a number of upward or downward "notches" relative to
the issuer credit rating, also known as the notching adjustment. Based on the issuer credit rating, the notching
adjustment is applied to arrive at the issue-sPEcific credit rating for each level of the capital structure.
A high recovery PErcentage implies a low loss severity, and this typically leads to an upward adjustment for the
issue-sPEcific credit rating relative to the issuer credit rating. Conversely, a low recovery PErcentage implies a high
loss severity, and this typically leads to a downward adjustment for the issue-sPEcific credit rating relative to the
issuer credit rating.
In general, S&P's notching methodology indicates a maximum upward adjustment of three notches for an issuesPEcific credit rating relative to the issuer credit rating and a maximum downward adjustment of two notches. For
example, an issuer with a credit rating of BB issues a subordinated debt instrument, and a downward adjustment
of two notches is appropriate. Two notches goes from BB to B+ (BB - BB- - B+). Therefore, the issue-sPEcific
credit rating for the subordinated debt instrument is B+.
In addition, caps are placed on upward adjustments for unSECured debt instruments, debts issued in certain
jurisdictions, and issuers rated BB+ or BB.

Refer to Example 4.2 for an illustrative analysis of an issue-sPEcific credit rating using the S&P notching methodology.
Other rating agencies' notching methodologies share similar attributes in assessing the loss severity of a debt
instrument in the event of default. The range of upward and downward adjustments relative to the issuer credit
rating is also comparable. While similar, Moody's methodology offers streamlined guidance that prescribes a
notching recommendation for each class of debt instrument, dePEnding on its seniority in the overall capital
structure, without the requirement to PErform a thorough waterfall analysis.
4.2.6 Interest Payment Structure
The interest rate of a debt instrument can be structured in various ways, such as fixed rate, floating rate, step up,
payment in kind, and zero coupon.
A fixed-rate instrument is a debt in which the interest payment is static or fixed for the term of the instrument.
A floating-rate instrument is a debt in which the interest payment is set based on some reference rate plus a
spread. A floating-rate note can be floored, capPEd, or collared6 to limit the variability in interest payments. Since
the reference rate changes PEriodically, the interest payment varies over the term of the instrument. The spread
that is quoted on top of the reference rate typically stays unchanged over the term of the instrument, unless there
is a change in risk for the business, in which case it would be renegotiated. The commonly used reference rate is
LIBOR, a benchmark interest rate intended to represent the level at which major banks estimate to borrow from and
lend to one another in the international interbank market for short-term loans on an unSECured basis. In Canada, the
LIBOR equivalent is CDOR. Refer to Module 5, ApPEndix 5B for current developments relating to LIBOR.
A step-up instrument is a debt in which the interest payment increases to prescribed rates at the sPEcified times
or when defined metrics (usually a leverage ratio) are triggered during the term of the instrument.
A payment-in-kind (PIK) instrument is a debt that accrues interest in additional principal rather than cash for a
partial PEriod or the full term. Where debt is owed in the form of a PIK, the balance owing by the debtor increases
over time as interest is accrued rather than paid. Financially distressed companies usually issue PIK instruments to
reduce the cash flow pressure on the issuer.
The stated interest rate is also called the coupon -- this term is commonly used in describing bonds. A zero-coupon
bond is a debt instrument that does not accrue or pay interest but instead issues and trades at a discount to the
principal value. Zero-coupon bonds are most prevalent for treasury bonds and uncommon for corporate bonds.
The frequency of interest payments can be monthly (common for loans), quarterly (common for bonds), or semiannually (common for treasury bills, which are bonds issued by a government agency).
4.2.7 Interest Rate vs. Yield
The interest rate of a debt instrument is stated on the credit agreement, and it's a contractual rate. The yield of a debt
instrument is calculated as the discount rate that equates the future cash flows until maturity to its price. There is an
inverse relationship between price and yield. The higher the price of a bond, the lower the yield, and vice versa. Yield
is a measure of return on a debt instrument, whereas price is the unit for quotes and trades. The risk exposure on the
changing yield of a debt instrument that results in changes in the value of the debt is known as the interest rate risk.
Typically, the yield equals the interest rate on the issuance date, when the issuance price equals the principal value,
also known as issued at par. As the debt instrument trades on the SECondary market, the transacted price varies,
and the yield changes.
An original issue discount is the discount in price from the debt instrument's principal value at the time of issuance.
The original issue discount results from supply and demand for similar loans offered in the market around the same
time. A debt instrument issued with an original issue discount, also known as issued below par, will have a yield
higher than the interest rate on the issuance date.
6
"Collared" is defined as a floating-rate note that is floored and capPEd.
62
04 -- Valuation of Financial Instruments-- Part 1 -- Debt Instruments
4.2.8 Principal Repayment Structure
A debt instrument's principal is the amount the issuer agrees to pay the debtholders when the instrument matures.
Principal repayment can be structured as a bullet payment at maturity or can be amortized over the life of the
instrument. Amortization can be structured as a fully amortized debt instrument such that the outstanding
principal amount is reduced to zero by the maturity date or as a partially amortized debt whereby a balloon
payment is required at maturity to pay down the remaining principal outstanding.
Debt instruments with maturity of less than three years are generally referred to as short-term debts. Debt maturing in
3 to 10 years is usually considered medium term. Debt maturing in 10 or more years is generally regarded as long term.
4.2.9 Optionality
Debt instruments can be structured with optionality, which gives either the issuer or the holders the right, but not
the obligation, to act. Common features of optionality include call, put, and conversion to equity. These options are
embedded in the sense that they are not separable from the debt instrument and cannot be traded separately.
A callable debt gives the issuer the right to call or buy back the debt prior to maturity. The issuer generally calls a
debt instrument at a time of falling interest, when it is beneficial to cancel the existing debt instrument and replace
it with one with a lower interest rate. A callable debt has more than one possible maturity date. The range of
possible dates includes all the call dates (or any date during a continuous call PEriod) and the final maturity date.
Therefore, the cash flows associated with the instrument are not explicit.
A puttable debt gives the holders the right to put or sell back the debt to the issuer prior to maturity. The effect
of the put option is the opposite of that of a callable debt. That is, the holders generally put a debt instrument
back to the issuer at a time of rising interest. As such, it's beneficial to recoup and reinvest at a higher interest
rate. Similarly, a puttable debt has more than one possible maturity date. The range of possible dates includes all
the put dates (or any date during a continuous put PEriod) and the final maturity date. Therefore, the cash flows
associated with the instrument are not explicit.
A convertible debt gives the holders the right to convert the debt into common shares of the issuer. A conversion
ratio, that is, how many shares can the debt instrument be converted into, is agreed on in the credit agreement at
the time of issuance. The holders generally convert the debt into shares when the conversion value7 exceeds that
of the convertible debt. Similarly, convertible debt has more than one possible maturity date. The range of possible
dates includes all the conversion dates (or any date during a continuous put PEriod) and the final maturity date.
Therefore, the cash flows associated with the instrument are not explicit.
Sometimes, a debt instrument is issued concurrently with warrants. A warrant is a SECurity giving the holders the
right to purchase common shares of the issuer at a prescribed price within a sPEcified time frame. A warrant is
separate from the debt instrument and can be traded separately.
Optionality, either embedded or separate, impacts the yield of the debt instrument, both at issuance and at
subsequent valuation dates. The valuation of debt instruments with optionality is discussed in SECtion 4.3.2.
4.2.10 SECuritization
SECuritization is a process that involves issuing debt instruments that are backed by a pool of assets, commonly
mortgages and consumer loans. The assets are typically held by a sPEcial-purpose vehicle, which collects income
from the underlying assets and makes payments to the holders of the debt instruments. Often, the sPEcial-purpose
vehicle issues various classes of debt instruments, and each class differs in seniority and yield. A higher seniority
usually implies lower loss severity and as such offers a lower yield, and vice versa. Most commonly, banks issue
SECuritized debt instruments as a way of funding, such as mortgage-backed SECurities and asset-backed SECurities.
7 Conversion value = Prevailing market price of share x Conversion ratio
63
04 -- Valuation of Financial Instruments-- Part 1 -- Debt Instruments
A mortgage-backed SECurity is a marketable SECurity that is created through SECuritizing pools of mortgage loans.
The underlying pools of mortgage loans provide the collateral and the cash flows used to service a mortgagebacked SECurity. The cash flow streams associated with a mortgage-backed SECurity include net interest from the
mortgage loans, scheduled principal payments of mortgage loans, and prepayments of mortgage loans.
Similar to a mortgage-backed SECurity, an asset-backed SECurity is the product of a SECuritization process.
Various debt-linked assets such as auto loans and credit card balance receivables are pooled together to form the
underlying assets that provide the collateral and cash flows to service the asset-backed SECurity.
Valuation of a SECuritized debt instrument is a quantitative intensive process beyond the scoPE of this module.
4.3 Valuation of Debt Instruments
A debt instrument can be valued using an asset-based, market-based, or income-based appROAch, similar to a
business valuation discussed in Level I.
The fIRSt step in selecting an appropriate appROAch is determining whether the debt instrument is a going concern.
The focus of this module is on the valuation of a going concern debt instrument.
A debt instrument is considered a going concern if it's exPEcted that the interest and principal owing on the
instrument will be paid in full and on time, and there is no indication of default. If a debt instrument is a going concern,
a market-based or income-based appROAch is appropriate to estimate its fair market value, with an income-based
appROAch being most appropriate. SPEcifically, a discounted cash flow method is commonly used. The application of
a discounted cash flow method in valuing a straight debt instrument, that is, a debt instrument without optionality, is
described in detail in SECtion 4.3.1. Valuation of a debt instrument with optionality is discussed in SECtion 4.3.2.
If a debt instrument is not a going concern, that is, either there is an indication of default (such as the issuer losing
a substantial revenue source) or an occurrence of an event of default (such as missing an interest or principal
payment and/or breaching certain covenants), an asset-based appROAch (sPEcifically the liquidation value) is most
appropriate to estimate its fair market value.
4.3.1 The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Method
In this SECtion, the term debt instrument is used interchangeably with straight debt instrument.
Put simply, the valuation of a debt instrument consists of estimating the cash flows associated with the debt
instrument and discounting all the cash flows at a discount rate reflective of the underlying risk of the debt instrument.
The application of the DCF method in valuing a debt instrument follows these six stEPS, described in more detail in
the SECtions below:
1. Estimate the cash flows associated with the debt instrument.
2. Calibrate the issuance yield to the issuance price.
3. Bifurcate the issuance yield into components.
4. Determine the appropriate discount rate as at the subsequent valuation date.
5. Consider adjustments to the discount rate.
6. Discount all the cash flows to present value as at the subsequent valuation date.
4.3.1.1 Estimate the Cash Flows Associated with the Debt Instrument
There are generally two tyPEs of cash flows associated with a debt instrument: (1) cash flows relating to the
PEriodic interest payment over the term of the debt instrument, and (2) cash flows relating to the principal
repayment on maturity.
64
04 -- Valuation of Financial Instruments-- Part 1 -- Debt Instruments
For debt instruments with fixed-rate interest and bullet principal repayment, the cash flows are straightforward to
estimate as there is certainty on the timing and amount of the cash flows associated with the instrument.
Complicating factors may arise dePEnding on the interest payment structures of a debt instrument, for example:
* For a debt instrument with floating-rate interest, the amount of future interest payments is uncertain, as the
reference rate is subject to changes over the term of the instrument. In this case, a valuator will need to estimate
the cash flows associated with the interest payment based on an assumption of the forward reference rates, that
is, what the reference rate will be at each future payment date. Forward reference rates are calculated by data
providers such as Bloomberg for all major reference rates in each major currency. Note: For the Level III course
assignments and exam, you will be provided with the appropriate forward reference rates in questions.
* For a debt instrument with step-up interest, the amount of future interest payments is also uncertain. The
applicable interest rate may change dePEnding on the company's future PErformance on the prescribed metrics.
In this case, a valuator will need to consider the plausible future metrics based on management's forecast for
the applicable PEriod and whether the results will impact the cash flows associated with the instrument.
A debt instrument's principal repayment structure, either bullet or amortizing, is usually certain and contractual.
There may be complications with the amortization calculation, typically depicted in a cash flow schedule as part of
the credit agreement.
4.3.1.2 Calibrate the Issuance Yield to the Issuance Price
Once the cash flows associated with the debt instrument have been determined, the issuance yield can be calibrated to
the issuance price of the instrument, similar to a goal-seek calculation. The known factors or inputs are the cash flows
and the issuance price, and the issuance yield needs to be solved for using numerical iteration. The issuance yield serves
as an anchor in determining the discount rates used in the subsequent valuations, as discussed in SECtion 4.3.1.4.
If the debt instrument was issued at par, the issuance yield equals the stated interest rate on the issuance date. If
the debt instrument was issued at a discount, the issuance yield is greater than the interest rate. Conversely, if the
debt instrument was issued at a premium, the issuance yield is less than the interest rate.
The one difference in applying the DCF method in valuing a debt instrument, contrary to valuing a business, is that
the initial issuance yield can typically be used as an anchor for determining the discount rate used in subsequent
valuations, for the following two reasons:
* Initial issuance of a debt instrument represents a fair market transaction whereby the parties transacted at the
highest price and acted at arm's length in an oPEn and unrestricted market. Neither was under compulsion to
transact; and
* The term of a debt instrument is typically short or medium term (i.e., less than 10 years). As such, the issuance
price is still relevant for future date valuations.
The assumption of a fair market transaction is not valid for intercompany loans and distressed debt issuances. As
such, the issuance yield cannot be used as an anchor for determining the discount rate for subsequent valuations.
4.3.1.3 Bifurcate the Issuance Yield into Components
Once the issuance yield of the debt instrument has been determined, the issuance yield can be bifurcated into
three components: (1) the risk-free rate, (2) the credit benchmark, and (3) the company-sPEcific risk.
The Risk-Free Rate Component
The risk-free rate component captures macROEconomic factors that affect all debt instruments, such as inflation,
economic growth, and monetary and fiscal policy.
For the risk-free rate component, the treasury bond yield corresponding to the term to maturity of the debt
instrument is typically used as a proxy.
65
04 -- Valuation of Financial Instruments-- Part 1 -- Debt Instruments
The Credit Benchmark Component
The credit benchmark component is meant to capture the prevailing market rates for debt instruments with similar
creditworthiness. In theory, this component consists of the credit risk premium and liquidity premium.
The credit risk premium can vary significantly dePEnding on the issuer and the industry it oPErates in, the issuer's
financial health, the seniority of the debt instrument relative to the overall capital structure, the market the debt
instrument trades in, and so on. The credit risk can typically be captured by a credit benchmark.
The liquidity premium, on the other hand, is generally difficult to measure. The general consensus is that the bond
market is more liquid than the loan market. Therefore, a bond requires a lower liquidity premium in comparison to a loan.
Generally, there are two appROAches to selecting a credit benchmark: customize a benchmark by identiFYing
comparable debt instruments with similar creditworthiness, or use an index published by a data provider.
Under the customized appROAch, a valuator needs to consider the nature of the business for each issuer and the
credit rating of each debt instrument. This appROAch is most suitable for a pure-play issuer oPErating in an established
industry where its comPEtitors have issued similarly rated bonds8 actively trading in the market. The customized
benchmark is most comparable to the subject debt instrument and most reflective of the prevailing market rates.
The index appROAch is commonly used for convenience. Bond indexes and loan indexes are published by data
providers and are expressed in terms of spread over the risk-free rate and prices. There is a long list of indexes, and
each is intended to reflect various characteristics, for example:
* Currency, such as USD, CAD, or EUR;
* Credit rating, either expressed in terms of letter grade credit rating (such as BBB+, BB+) or bROAd categories
(such as investment grade vs. high yield); and
* Industry, such as utility, industrial, financial, and so on.
Each data provider develops its own methodology that details the selection criteria, the computation method, and
the publication frequency for each index.
Generally, the bond indexes capture instruments with an investment-grade credit rating (from AAA to BBB). The
loan indexes capture instruments with a sPEculative-grade credit rating (from BB+ to B-).
Commonly used bond indexes at the time of writing include the ICE Bank of America Merrill Lynch bond indexes
and the Bloomberg bond indexes. Commonly used loan indexes include the S&P Leveraged Commentary & Data
(LCD) loan index.
The Company-SPEcific Risk Component
The company-sPEcific risk component is intended to capture additional risk associated with a subject debt
instrument that has not been quantified in the credit benchmark. This component reflects the additional risk
sPEcific to the issuer and the subject debt instrument. It also captures any differences between the subject debt
instrument and the selected credit benchmark. The company-sPEcific risk component is meant to be a catch-all
and is calculated as the residual by deducting the risk-free rate and credit benchmark from the issuance yield.
Formula 1 below shows the mathematical calculation:
Formula 1:
Company-sPEcific risk = Issuance yield - Risk-free rate - Credit benchmark
It's important to understand and document what the company-sPEcific risk component captures as of the issuance
date. This understanding serves as the baseline to track subsequent changes in the company-sPEcific risk at each
of the subsequent valuation dates.

4.3.1.4 Determine the Appropriate Discount Rate as at the Subsequent Valuation Date
Fast forward to a subsequent valuation date, and the build-up method would be used in determining the appropriate
discount rate. That is, the discount rate is built up by fIRSt rolling forward the risk-free rate and credit benchmark to
the subsequent valuation date, then adding the company-sPEcific risk premium as depicted in Formula 2:
Formula 2:
Discount rate = Risk-free rate + Credit benchmark + Company-sPEcific risk
The roll-forward process is intended to capture the prevailing market rates reflective of the macROEconomic
factors and debt market conditions at the subsequent valuation date. Adjustments to the company-sPEcific risk
component should also be considered by assessing the change of creditworthiness of the underlying issuer as well
as any change in instrument-sPEcific risk as at the valuation date.
4.3.1.5 Consider Adjustments to the Discount Rate as at the Subsequent Valuation Date
A valuator must consider whether there are changes to the creditworthiness of the subject debt instrument since the
issuance date. The most common change is a credit migration, a change in the credit rating of the debt instrument.
In this case, the discount rate must be adjusted to reflect the difference in the credit rating of the debt instrument as
at the subsequent valuation date. Often, the credit rating of a debt instrument is not updated. Therefore, a valuator
would need to consider applying metrics that can monitor the creditworthiness of the issuer and the subject debt
instrument between the issuance date and the valuation date. The risk exposure associated with the rating assigned
to a bond being downgraded is known as the downgrade risk. Various factors can impact a debt instrument's
downgrade risk, such as changing market conditions, the ability of the issuer to make good on its promise, and so on.
A valuator should also consider whether there are changes to the company-sPEcific risk component compared to
what was understood at the time of issuance.
4.3.1.6 Discount All the Cash Flows to Present Value as at the Subsequent Valuation Date
The last step in valuing a debt instrument is to discount all the cash flows to present value using Formula 3:

4.3.2 Valuation of Debt Instruments with Optionality
4.3.2.1 Valuation of Debt Instruments with Embedded Options
A debt instrument with embedded options is subject to various uncertainties that would change the exPEcted cash
flows associated with the instrument. For example, a callable debt or a puttable debt is subject to uncertainties
about future interest rates. A convertible debt is subject to uncertainties about the future share prices of the issuer.
The valuation of a debt instrument with optionality is often mathematically advanced. It also involves making
assumptions about the uncertainties that would change the value of the optionality. The application of valuation
methods is beyond the scoPE of this module. Instead, this SECtion focuses on the concepts behind the valuation
and the directions of value changes.
Callable Debt
A callable debt is used as an example. A callable debt can be thought of as two parts: (1) a straight debt that makes
interest payments and principal repayments, and (2) a call option that allows the issuer to call or buy back the debt.
Focusing on the call option, at each eligible call date, the issuer has two choices: call the debt or do nothing. The issuer's
decision is dePEndent on the prevailing market rate. If the prevailing market rate is lower than the stated interest rate,
the issuer will call the debt and issue new debt at a lower rate. If the prevailing market rate is higher than the stated
interest rate, the issuer will do nothing and keep the existing debt. As such, the call option is advantageous to the issuer
but disadvantageous to the debtholders. Therefore, the value of a callable debt can be depicted by Formula 4:
Formula 4:
Value of callable debtt = Value of straight debtt - Value of call optiont
Holders of callable debt are subject to reinvestment risk, a situation whereby the callable debt is repaid in a
low interest rate environment, and the holders will have to reinvest the cash proceeds at a lower rate than the
promised yield on the original instrument.
Puttable Debt
Similarly, a puttable debt can be thought of as two parts: (1) a straight debt that makes interest payments and
principal repayments, and (2) a put option that allows the debtholders to put or sell the debt. Focusing on the
put option, the debtholders have two options at each eligible put date: put the debt or do nothing. Again, the
debtholders' decision is dePEndent on the prevailing market rate. If the prevailing market rate is lower than the
stated interest rate on the debt, the debtholders will do nothing and keep the existing debt. If the prevailing market
rate is higher than the stated interest rate, the debtholders will put the debt and reinvest in higher yield instruments.
The effect of the put option is the opposite of that of a call option. That is, the put option is disadvantageous to the
issuer but advantageous to the debtholders. Therefore, the value of a puttable debt can be depicted by Formula 5:
68
04 -- Valuation of Financial Instruments-- Part 1 -- Debt Instruments
Formula 5:
Value of puttable debtt = Value of straight debtt + Value of put optiont
In combination, the value of a debt instrument with embedded options can be depicted by Formula 6:
Formula 6:
Value of debt with embedded optionst = Value of straight debtt
- Value of options granted to the issuert
+ Value of options granted to debtholderst
Convertible Debt
Similarly, a convertible debt can be thought of as two parts: (1) a straight debt that makes interest payments and
principal repayments, and (2) a conversion option that allows the debtholders to convert the debt instrument into
the issuer's shares. Since a conversion option is not a typical option traded on the market, it will be translated into
a market convention. That is, a conversion option can be thought of as a call option on the issuer's shares.
For the call option, the debtholders have two options at each eligible exercise date: exercise the call and convert the
debt into shares, or do nothing. The debtholders' decision is dePEndent on the prevailing share prices of the issuer.
If the conversion value is greater than the straight debt value, the debtholders will exercise the call. If the conversion
value is less than the straight debt value, the debtholders will do nothing. As such, the call option is advantageous to
the debtholders. Applying Formula 6, the value of a convertible debt can be depicted by Formula 7 and Formula 8:
Formula 7:
Value of convertible debtt = Value of straight debtt + Value of option granted to debtholdert
Formula 8:
Value of convertible debtt = Value of straight debtt + Value of call option on the issuer's sharest
In summary, valuation of a debt instrument with embedded options can be thought of as two parts: (1) valuation of
the straight debt portion using the DCF method discussed in SECtion 4.3.1, and (2) valuation of the options using
the methods discussed in Module 5, SECtion 5.5.3.
4.3.2.2 Valuation of Debt Instruments Issued with Warrants
Recall that sometimes a debt instrument is issued concurrently with warrants. At the time of issuance, the transaction
can be thought of as two parts: (1) a straight debt that makes interest payments and principal repayments, and (2)
warrants that can be exercised to buy the issuer's shares. The value of the issuance can be depicted by Formula 9:
Formula 9:
Value of issuance (debt instrument issued with warrants)(t=0)
= Value of straight debt(t=0) + Value of warrants(t=0)
Where:
(t=0) = the time of issuance
Note that the warrants are separated from the debt instrument. As such, the value of the warrants does not impact
the value of the debt instrument in subsequent valuations.
Therefore, the valuation of the debt instrument follows the same stEPS as discussed in SECtion 4.3.1, except for the
calibration of issuance yield to the issuance price shown in SECtion 4.3.1.2. SPEcifically, the issuance price needs to
be adjusted for the value of the warrants as of the issuance date, as the debtholders "paid" for two components:
the straight debt and the warrants. Deducting the value of the warrants from the issuance price gets to the true
"price" the debtholders paid for the straight debt.

Example 4.2: Issuer and Issue-SPEcific Credit Rating Analysis
Background
Founded in 2010, EarthMama is an online grocer that delivers local organic produce and meat right to customers'
doors. It offers a subscription-based service where the customers can either choose from a curated selection of
grocery baskets or customize their order.
With overwhelming success on the East Coast, EarthMama decided to expand to the West Coast in 2015. To fund
its expansion, EarthMama issued a private debt to WhitePoint Capital, a private debt fund sPEcializing in lending to
the Canadian mid-market. Table 1 summarizes the salient terms of the debt instrument.

Issuer Credit Rating Analysis
The S&P corporate rating methodology is used as a reference to PErform a credit rating on EarthMama.
Step 1 -- PErform country risk assessment:
EarthMama oPErates solely in Canada, a jurisdiction rated by S&P as very low risk considering its robust economy,
the effectiveness of institutions and governance, the health of the financial system, and the rule of law that governs
the payment culture in the country.
Step 2 -- PErform industry risk assessment:
EarthMama oPErates in the retail and restaurant industry that is rated by S&P as intermediate risk in the global
industry risk assessment.
Step 3 -- PErform corporate industry and country risk assessment (CICRA):
Based on the country risk and industry risk assessment, EarthMama's CICRA is a score of 3. Refer to Table 3 for the
S&P rating scale on CICRA.

Step 4 -- PErform comPEtitive position assessment:
ComPEtitive position is assessed based on four components: (1) comPEtitive advantage, (2) scale, scoPE, and
diversity, (3) oPErating efficiency, and (4) profitability.
FIRSt, separately assess comPEtitive advantage; scale, scoPE, and diversity; and oPErating efficiency. SECond,
apply weighting factors to these three components to derive a weighted average assessment that translates
into a preliminary comPEtitive position assessment. Third, assess profitability. Finally, combine the preliminary
comPEtitive position assessment and the profitability assessment to determine the final comPEtitive position
assessment. Profitability can confirm or influence, positively or negatively, the comPEtitive position assessment.
71
04 -- Valuation of Financial Instruments-- Part 1 -- Debt Instruments
Based on your analysis, you have determined that:
* ComPEtitive advantage is adequate. EarthMama's online and delivery model is well adapted to market
conditions as customer behaviours are trending toward online shoPPIng. However, given its size and regional
focus, it's not necessarily a leader in setting industry trends. EarthMama's products are suPErior since they
are locally sourced and organic. However, the stability of supply and quality of products are uncertain as it
doesn't own or oPErate any part of the supply chain. Its products are priced at a premium for the quality and
services provided. While the subscription-based model enhances customer stickiness, the subscription can
be cancelled any time at no charge; this option to cancel increases the risk of customer attrition. There are
some barriers to entry, as the supply of genuinely local and organic produce and meat is limited, and it has
established relationships with a few key suppliers.
* Scale, scoPE, and diversity are adequate/weak as it offers a limited selection of seasonal produce and meat.
EarthMama is a niche player offering premium products and services. However, its market share accounts
for less than 5% of the local market. EarthMama's oPErating model has proven successful in a metropolitan
setting where customers are clustered and within certain serviceable boundaries. However, the trend of
PErmanent remote work triggered more families to move away from a metropolitan centre, and this trend
adds uncertainty to EarthMama's oPErating model.
* OPErating efficiency is adequate/weak. EarthMama has demonstrated the ability to manage most fixed costs
as it has no brick-and-mortar presence. However, managing variable costs has proven challenging as fresh
produce and meat have a limited shelf life. Its cost structure is in line with its PEers -- cost savings on
a physical presence is offset by higher oPErating costs on packaging and delivery.
* Based on the above, you determined a score of 3.6 for the preliminary comPEtitive assessment. Refer to
Table 4 for a summary of the assessment.

* Profitability is measured by return on capital and EBITDA margin. To assess the level of profitability measured
by return on capital, you calculated a five-year average, consisting of the two-year historical figures and threeyear forecast. EarthMama's return on capital was calculated to be 10%, which is considered average based on
S&P's methodology.9 In assessing volatility of profitability measured by the EBITDA margin, you looked at the
historical EBITDA margin since inception. You concluded that the volatility of the EBITDA margin is somewhat
higher than the industry average based on S&P's guidance. There were significant dips in the margin at times
of modest swing in customer demand and downturns in the economic cycle. As such, you determined a score

Step 8 -- Consider the modifier adjustments and PErform comparable ratings analysis:
Five modifiers are considered in adjusting the anchor credit rating: (1) diversification/portfolio effect, (2) capital
structure, (3) financial policy, (4) liquidity, and (5) management and governance. Based on your analysis, you
determined a neutral rating for each modifier; therefore, there was no impact on the anchor rating.
You then PErformed a comparable ratings analysis and determined a neutral assessment based on a holistic review
of EarthMama's stand-alone credit risk profile; therefore, there was no impact on the anchor rating.
Step 9 -- Consider group or government influence:
Based on your assessment, you determined that EarthMama is not subject to any group or government influence.
Step 10 -- Conclude on the issuer credit rating:
Based on the credit rating analysis outlined in stEPS 1 to 9, you concluded an issuer credit rating of BB for
EarthMama.

Issue-SPEcific Credit Rating Analysis
Step 1 -- Estimate enterprise value at the time of hypothetical default:
Assuming a hypothetical default, you determined that EarthMama is likely to be restructured as a going concern.
As such, you estimated the EV at emergence to be $30 million.
Step 2 -- Estimate EAD at the time of hypothetical default:
You determined that the private debt issued to WhitePoint Capital is the only debt instrument outstanding. EAD is
estimated to be $103 million, which equates to the accrued and unpaid interest for the recent quarter plus principal
outstanding.
Step 3 -- PErform the waterfall analysis:
According to a waterfall reflective of the relative seniority within EarthMama's capital structure, you allocated the
EV to the outstanding debt claim. Refer to Table 10 for the waterfall analysis and recovery PErcentage calculation.

Based on the S&P notching scale as presented in Exhibit 4.6, the recovery PErcentage of 100% implies a recovery
rating of 5, which translates into a downward adjustment of one notch relative to the issuer credit rating.
Step 4 -- Conclude on the issue-sPEcific credit rating:
Based on your analysis outlined in stEPS 1 to 3, you concluded an issue-sPEcific credit rating of BB- for the private
debt issued to WhitePoint Capital.
Credit Rating Conclusions
Based on your analysis, you conclude the following as of the valuation date:
* A hypothetical issuer-sPEcific credit rating of BB for EarthMama; and
* A hypothetical issue-sPEcific credit rating of BB- for the private debt issued to WhitePoint Capital.
Example 4.3: Valuation of a Straight Debt -- Detailed Analysis
Background
This continues from Example 4.2 on the EarthMama engagement. To recap, you have determined the issue-sPEcific
credit rating for EarthMama's private debt to be BB- as of the valuation date. The salient terms of the private debt
are summarized in Table 11.

04 -- Valuation of Financial Instruments-- Part 1 -- Debt Instruments
Required:
The SECond part of the engagement is to determine the fair market value of the private debt as at the valuation date.
Solution:
You reviewed EarthMama's forecasted financial metrics (refer to Example 4.2, Table 2). You noted a healthy cash
flow forecast of FFO10/cash interest ratios above 3.0x and leverage ratio of debt/EBITDA ratios less than 3.5x for
the remaining term to maturity. As such, you conclude that EarthMama's private debt is a going concern as the
company is exPEcted to have the financial strength to make full and timely payments on the private debt. PEr
discussion with management, EarthMama is also up to date on all payments associated with the private debt.
There is no indication of default as of the valuation date. As such, you determined that the income appROAch is
appropriate in valuing the private debt. SPEcifically, you will apply the DCF method. The analysis is detailed in each
of the stEPS below.
Step 1 -- Estimate the cash flows associated with the private debt:
The private debt bears a fixed interest rate of 10% payable semi-annually and matures in a bullet payment. As
such, the exPEcted cash flows associated with the private debt can be estimated with certainty and as detailed in
Table 12.
10 Refer to Example 4.2, Table 2 footnote for detailed calculation.

04 -- Valuation of Financial Instruments-- Part 1 -- Debt Instruments
Step 3 -- Bifurcate the issuance yield into components:
You bifurcate the issuance yield into three components. Consideration for each is as follows:
* Risk-free rate:
* You used the five-year Bank of Canada Treasury bond yield of 0.73% (given) as a proxy.
* Credit benchmark:
* You determined the search criteria for similar debt instruments as follows:
Credit rating: BB-;
Industry: retail and restaurant;
Geography: Canada or North America; and
Currency: CAD or USD.
* FIRSt, you searched the Canadian bond market for issuers oPErating in the retail and restaurant industry and
identified one issuer, Weston. Weston is a national grocer with mega-size brick-and-mortar suPErmarkets
across Canada. Weston owns the majority of its oPErating locations and is the market leader in the retail
grocery space. However, it has no e-commerce channels. Given the difference in oPErating models and
asset mixes, you concluded that Weston is not comparable to EarthMama.
* You then searched for a Canadian BB- bond index. This was unsuccessful since most of the bonds traded
in the Canadian market are rated as investment grade (contrary to the private debt, which is rated as
sPEculative grade).
* You then looked to the U.S. bond market for issuers oPErating in the retail and restaurant industry, focusing
on e-commerce. You identified one issuer, WholesomeFood. Similar to EarthMama, WholesomeFood
focuses solely on e-commerce and has no brick-and-mortar locations. It offers online grocery delivery
services across the United States. In 2014, WholesomeFood issued a $250 million bond at 6% maturing in
March 2019. The WholesomeFood bond was rated as BBB as of the issuance date. Given the difference in
credit rating, you concluded that WholesomeFood's bond is comparable from an industry standpoint but
not from a credit rating PErsPEctive, which you view as more critical.
* You then searched for a U.S. BB- bond index and identified one bROAd industry index. You then looked
at the industry composition of the index. You noted that 50% of the bonds were issued by companies
oPErating in the oil and gas industry and 30% in the technology SECtor. You believe that both industries are
subject to considerably higher risk compared to the retail and restaurant industry. As such, the debtholders
would typically require a higher yield for bonds with similar credit ratings. In short, the U.S. BB- BROAd
Industry Bond Index is comparable from a credit rating standpoint but is not reflective of the industry risk
of the subject instrument.
* You continued your search in the U.S. loan market and identified a retail and restaurant BB- loan index.
You concluded that this is the most appropriate credit benchmark as it reflects both the credit rating and
industry group of the subject instrument. The U.S. BB- retail and restaurant loan index was observed to be
6.95% (given) as of the issuance date.
* Company-sPEcific risk:
* This component is calculated as the residual from the bifurcation process.
Table 14 summarizes the bifurcation analysis. Note that the common unit of measure for spread, the interest rate
over the risk-free rate, is in basis points (bps). One basis point is equal to 1/100th of 1%, or 0.01%, or 0.0001.

Step 4 -- Determine the appropriate discount rate as at the valuation date:
To determine the appropriate discount rate at the valuation date, fIRSt roll forward the risk-free rate and the credit
benchmark to the valuation date and then add the company-sPEcific risk premium. The risk-free rate was observed
to be 1.86% (given) as of the valuation date. The U.S. BB- retail and restaurant loan index was observed to be 7.90%
(given) as of the valuation date. Table 15 summarizes the calculation.

Overall, while keeping the company-sPEcific risk unchanged from the issuance date, the discount rate is 208 bps
higher than the issuance yield, mainly driven by an increase in both the risk-free rate and the credit benchmark as
a result of rate increases in the debt market.
Note that the risk-free rate used at the valuation date corresponds to the remaining term to maturity of two years.
Therefore, the increase in the risk-free rate is attributable to an overall increase in the treasury yield curve.
Step 5 -- Consider adjustments to the discount rate:
You then assessed any adjustments required to reflect changes in the creditworthiness of the private debt. Since
the private debt was not rated as at the issuance date, you applied the key financial metrics used in the issuer
credit rating analysis (refer to Example 4.2, Table 2) as a framework to monitor any indications of credit migration.
You calculated the same metrics as of the issuance date then compared them to the valuation date. Table 16
summarizes the calculation of each key financial metric (given) as of the issuance date.

(1) EarthMama's fiscal year-end is December 31 for each year
(2) Calculated as Net income / (Book value of debt + Book value of equity)
(3) Funds from oPErations (FFO) to debt ratio, which is calculated as (EBITDA - Cash interest - Cash tax) / Total debt
(4) Cash flow from oPEration (CFO) to debt ratio, which is calculated as Cash flow from oPEration / Total debt
(5) Free oPErating cash flow (FOCF) to debt ratio, which is calculated as (CFO - Capital exPEnditures) / Total debt
(6) Discretionary cash flow to debt ratio, which is calculated as (FOCF - Cash dividend - Share buybacks) / Total debt
Although the metrics changed slightly between the two dates, you determined that they point to the same level
of financial risk profile (refer to Example 4.2, Table 2). Therefore, you concluded that the creditworthiness of the
private debt remained the same between the issuance date and the valuation date. Hence no adjustment to the
discount rate is required.
Step 6 -- Calculate the present value of the estimated cash flows:
The last step is to calculate the present value of the estimated cash flow determined in Step 1 using the discount
rate determined in Step 5. Table 17 summarizes the calculation.
