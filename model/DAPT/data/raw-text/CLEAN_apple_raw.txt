Investment Thesis
We recommend a HOLD rating as Apple is positioned as one
of the largest companies in the technology industry and their
stock is trading at a value that is relatively where it should
be.
Drivers of thesis:
* Artificial Intelligence: Apple plans to join the AI race
by introducing 'on-device' AI features to iPhones
and overhauling its entire Mac line with AI-focused
M4 chips.
* Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality: The release
of Apple Vision Pro rekindles public's interest in
virtual and mixed reality gadgets, spurring a bROAder
demand for wearables.
* Services growth: Apple has seen strong growth in its
services segment and will continue to see strong
growth
Risks to thesis:
* Economic Conditions: With interest rates continuing
to remain high, this could lead to a decline in
consumer sPEnding which could negatively impact
Apple's revenue.
* Lawsuits: Apple is currently facing numerous
lawsuits for anticomPEtitive practices in the U.S. and
abROAd that could have negative financial and
business model impacts
* ComPEtition: Apple has seen China sales decline due
to new emerging players such as Huawei
smartphones

Economic Analysis
Economic Outlook
Consumer Confidence Index
The Consumer Confidence Index reflects the
level of optimism or PEssimism that consumers
feel about the overall state of the economy.
The Conference board measures the index
having 5,000 households take a survey about
the state of the economy. A higher Consumer
Confidence Index typically leads to increased
consumer sPEnding and increased stock
PErformance. The index was 104.7 in March,
essentially unchanged from a downwardly
revised 104.8 in February.
Compared to historical levels, the Consumer
Confidence Index is high. However, consumer
confidence has still not reached its pre
pandemic levels. We believe that Consumer
Confidence Index will remain relatively
unchanged in the Q2 of 2024. However, in
2025 we believe rate cuts will help bolster
consumer confidence back to pre-pandemic
levels. For Apple, we forecast this will have a
neural impact on Apple revenue in 2025.
Demand for consumer technology will increase
as technology continues to innovate, allowing
Apple to make it easier to sell their products at
higher prices.
10-year Treasury Yield (Interest rates)
Federal Funds rate determines the rate in which
banks overnight lend to one another. The Fed
made rate hikes to fight inflation and has since
held them at a target range of 5.25-5.50
PErcent. A high federal funds rate increases has
increased treasury borrowing costs.

increased
The 10-year
because of the high Federal Funds Rate. This
will increase the cost of capital as high treasury
yields result in higher corporate bond yields for
businesses. The higher cost of capital will likely
decrease consumer sPEnding and corporate
financing strategies. For Apple, this could
negatively impact industries such as consumer
electronics which is where Apple oPErates in.
However, Apple has strong financials to be able
to withstand these high borrowing costs.
We forecast that treasury yields will likely see a
decrease when the federal funds rate decreases.
In the coming months we exPEct the economy
to slow down. We estimate that the federal
reserve will begin cutting rates in September of
2024 with a target range of 5.00% - 5.25%. By
the end of 2025 we exPEct the target rate to

decrease to 4.00-4.25%. While these rate cuts
will help decrease the cost of capital, the
treasury yield will remain high for Apple and
will have a harder time financing their capital

acquiring strong artificial intelligence to create
a new voice assistant, Apple will be more
focused on created a strategic alliance or
acquisition of an existing company in the AI
field as opposed to looking to invest more in
research and development for that innovation.
Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
The Real GDP is the market value of all goods
and services within in a country, adjusted for
inflation. Real GDP is crucial for the technology
SECtor as it reflects economic health, influencing
investment, consumer sPEnding, and business
expansion. A growing real GDP boosts demand

encourages innovation, and enhances global
comPEtitiveness in the tech industry. In the past,
technology companies tend to do very well in

high interest rates, Real GDP in the U.S. had
moderate real GDP growth increasing 2.5%.

and
In 2024, we believe Real GDP will remain at
moderate growth increasing 1.5-2.0%. This is
due to a slowdown in consumer sPEnding and
the economy beginning to cool after high
interest rates.
For our long term forecast we believe impacted
by the Feds rate cuts. Lowering interest rates
will lower the borrowing cost which in turn will

Considering
The Technology industry has already seen
significant
the advent of
generative AI, adding value equivalent to as
much as 9 PErcent of global industry revenue.
Knowledge-based industries such as banking
(up to 5 PErcent), pharmaceuticals and medical
products (also up to 5 PErcent), and education
(up to 4 PErcent) could exPErience significant
effects as well. Although there is credible
promise of a positive impact on GDP by AI,
some industry professionals are predicting that
the generative AI bubble could burst within the
4
next 12 months. New York University professor
Gary Marcus who testified alongside OPEnAI
CEO Sam ALTMan at a Senate hearing stated that
the industry is sPEnding more money than it is
raking in. For instance, venture-capital firm
Sequoia claimed that $50 billion had been sPEnt
by the industry in 2023 on Nvidia chips which
provided vital computing power for AI but only
$3 billion was made in revenue. Seeing the huge
discrepancy between the promise and the actual
delivery of AI, we believe that AI-led growth
might not live up to the hyPE that the industry
initially grew off.
Companies like OPEn AI may have had the fIRStmover advantage to establish significant market
dominance, but it is not disadvantageous to
adopt a fast follower appROAch. By accustoming
the company to AI applications via fIRSt-movers,
fast followers can learn from the misstEPS of the
pioneers at a lower cost, with better technology
and are often closer to a more receptive market
which has accustomed itself to AI applications

The generative AI bloom has prompted
investors pumPEd a total of $29.1 billion
combined into nearly 700 generative AI deals,
an increase of more than 260% in value from the
prior year. Currently, Microsoft, Alphabet and
Meta are the tech heavyweights that represent
the largest market cap in the AI space. On the
surface, it seems like Apple is lagging its tech
giant PEers. However, Apple suggests in a new
research paPEr that it is developing a new
generative AI model called MM1 which could
possibly be a breakthrough technique that could
help in running AI on iPhones. Furthermore,
Apple's recent plans to overhaul its entire Mac
line with AI-focused M4 chips have sent its
stock up 4.3% and added $112 billion in value
in its best PErformance in nearly a year.
Therefore, AI will continue to be an opportunity
for growth not only for tech giants like Apple,
but also other companies within the tech SECtor
looking to adopt AI in their products and
oPErations.

ComPEtition and PEer Comparisons
Major Players:
Porter's 5 Forces:
ComPEtitive Rivalry: High
Due to its presence in the smartphone, tablet,
laptop and desktop markets, Apple is in direct
comPEtition with a wide range of comPEtitors
that offer similar products. In the fIRSt quarter of
2024, Apple's smartphone shipments fell by
around 10% after being hurt by intensiFYing
comPEtition from Samsung who clinched the
top phone maker spot from Apple at 20.8%
market share. Microsoft and Google also
comPEte with Apple in the oPErating system,
hardware, and service markets, with Microsoft's
Windows and Surface products and Google's
AndROId OS and hardware offerings like Pixel
smartphones. Tech companies across various
SECtors such as Amazon in voice assistants and
streaming, Lenovo in PErsonal computers (PCs),
SpotiFY in music streaming, and other players in
wearables and PErsonal computers, present
further challenges for Apple. Due to the strong
comPEtition that Apple is up against, we believe
that comPEtition rivalry should be of great
consideration
to
Apple.

Threats of New Entrants: Low
Apple's share of the US smartphone market
exceeds 70%, and its share of the bROAder
smartphone market exceeds 65%, according to
DOJ. Apple has been able to leverage its large
market power to stay ahead of the comPEtition.
third-party payment
semiconductor companies favor big tech players
like Apple for its massive buying power, huge
demand for its products, and the company's
ability to place custom orders for components
used its products. This means that aside from
having almost complete control on the cost of
its components, the company is also able to
procure components a lot faster than its rivals.
its
Almost 95% of Apple products used to be
manufactured solely in China. Since 2018,
Apple's suppliers have sPEnt around $16 billion
to diversiFY its production assets away from
China to India, Mexico, the U.S. and Vietnam.
By being less reliant on one country to
manufacture its products, geopolitical tensions
like the US-China trade war will less likely
threaten Apple's supply chain and give
suppliers less of an upPEr hand in determining
prices for its parts.
Bargaining Power of Buyers: Moderate
Apple has had the highest brand loyalty of more
than 90% for the past three years, with
customers willing to pay a premium for the
brand and product exPErience. However, in
recent years, Apple has been facing increasing
comPEtition from Chinese rivals like Huawei
Technologies and Xiaomi, causing sales in
China to drop by 13% in the quarter in
December
to $20.8 billion and missing
estimates of $23.5 billion. To fend off
comPEtition from Chinese domestic rivals,
Apple has started offering Chinese consumers
discounts of up to 800 yuan (US$113) on
products ranging from iPhones to Macbooks.
Therefore, foreign buyers, esPEcially those in
China, may be able to apply pressure on Apple
vendor to lower product prices to maintain the
attractiveness of Apple products abROAd.
Threats of Substitute Products: Moderate
Apple has invested heavily in the Apple
ecosystem which
integrated Apple

environment
that offers a seamless user
exPErience across all Apple products and
services. Many companies like Google have
tried to replicate Apple's ecosystem with its
own Pixel ecosystem. Google's Pixel latest line
includes Google Pixel 8 phone, Google Pixel
Watch for health tracking, Pixel Buds for
seamless listening exPErience and Nest-branded
the Pixel
smart home devices. However,
ecosystem is far from being as exclusive and
restrictive as the Apple ecosystem. Although the
devices can work seamlessly together, their
software still lacks the vital services and
applications to support it. Although products
from other tech companies like Google are not
direct substitutes of Apple products, they still
act as strong alternatives which could present a
moderate level of threat to Apple products and
services.

Catalysts for Growth or Change
Augmented Reality & Virtual Reality (AR/VR)
2023 marked a slow year for AR/VR headsets
as global shipments declined by 23.5%.
However, a sales rebound is predicted for 2024
with shipments forecasted to rise by 44.2% to
9.7 million units. Despite initial lukewarm
public response to AR/VR in its early years with
the launch of Meta's Metaverse, the release of
Apple Vision Pro has seemed to change the tide
against the metaverse and related technologies.
The public's interest in virtual and mixed reality
gadgets has also been rekindled by the largely
positive reviews received by Meta's Quest 3

rate
(CAGR) of 29.2% as the consumer base slowly
grows beyond core gaming use cases and as
businesses adopt more headsets for training,
design, and more. On the other hand, AR
headsets are exPEcted to grow from a smaller
base of less than a million units in 2024 to 10.9
million in 2028, representing an 87.1% CAGR
over the same PEriod.
However, we are still far from mainstream
adoption of AR/VR headsets due to two
reasons: hefty price tags attached to them and
the hardware limitations of these AR/VR
headsets that might hinder a seamless consumer
exPErience.
Compact Wearable Devices
There is a shift of consumer preference towards
technology, esPEcially discrete,
hands-free
screenless devices that integrate seamlessly into
our daily lives. Wearables have also made huge
advances in sensor technology over the past few
years, providing consumer with large amounts
of data and insights about their health and
wellness. From potentially detecting chronic
diseases like AFib to measuring stress levels
tracking sleep, wearables have way
and
surpassed its initial function as a stEPS tracker.
Because of how wearables allow consumers to
make their data more actionable, we anticipate
that such a feature will attract more consumers.
In 2022, the global wearable technology market
was valued at $61.3 billion and is exPEcted to
grow at a CAGR of 14.6% from 2023 to 2030.

Strengths
Apple's greatest strength is its strong brand
recognition supported by consistent marketing
excellence. The company continues to be one of
the world's most valuable brands, with a brand
value of about $880.5 billion in 2023. It has also
constantly won the CMO Survey Award for
Marketing Excellence for ten conSECutive years,
making Apple one of the greatest marketers for
all time. Apple has PErfected the art of
minimalism by striPPIng its products down to its
fundamentals. Products have simple, clean
lines, with even simpler, self-explanatory
names. The core purpose of this simplicity is to
make the products easy to use so they can be
understood and easily adopted by non-exPErts.
Furthermore, Apple has always empowered
customers who "think differently", seeking to
inspire customers to do things in a unique and
creative ways. As its products become a lot
more widely used, Apple has had to work harder
to maintain that focus. For artists, businesses,
and students alike, Apple has worked to foster a
sense of community and attract new members.
Currently, Apple aims to spark the interest of
potential customers by providing youth
initiatives like free coding workshops.

11
Apple is overly dePEndent on its iPhone sales
which accounted for over 58% of the company's
overall revenue in the fIRSt quarter of the fiscal
year 20. Relying heavily on just a single product
line increases the possibility of exposing Apple
to significant risks, more prominently economic
fluctuations. Shifts in consumer preferences and
industry disruptions could also adversely impact
revenue streams and profitability. Therefore,
further diversiFYing Apple's product portfolio
and its revenue streams would help to mitigate
these risks a lot more significantly by spreading
exposure across multiple market segments and
offerings. This will ensure that even in times of
market volatility, Apple will still be wellpositioned to weather challenges and sustain
long-term success.
Opportunities
The ongoing AI race will present a large
opportunity for growth for Apple. Apple has not
included any additional AI-powered features in
their flagship smartphones and therefore, has yet
to fully reap benefits from AI. Currently, Apple
is exPEcted to introduce new 'on-device' AI
features, meaning that Apple's Large Language
Model would not need to use cloud processing.
According to Counterpoint Research, 1 billion
GenAI smartphones will be shipPEd between
2024 and 2027, with the GenAI smartphone
share of overall smartphone shipments reaching
11% by 2024 and 43% by 2027. In anticipation
for Apple's entry into the AI segment, the
company is forecasted to lead in the GenAI
smartphone original equipment manufacturer
(OEM) rankings in 2025.
Threats
Apple's greatest threat is the high degree of
litigation it is being subjected to. Over the past
few years, Apple has been accused of antitrust
violations and anti-comPEtitive practices in
lawsuits filed by Epic Games in 2020 and more
recently in 2024, the Department of Justice
(DoJ). As a result, Apple has had to give up
several features that once gave the company a
comPEtitive edge. In response to the legal battle
with Epic Games, Apple changed the rules of
the U.S. App Store. Instead of having Apple
develoPErs to use Apple's billing systems for
digital goods like game money, Apple now
allows app makers whose target customers from
the U.S. to include links and buttons within their
apps to direct users to external sites to input
their credit card information. With Apple's
current lawsuit with DoJ, Apple may also risk
losing control over restricting suPErapps, cloud
streaming gaming apps, smartwatches, digital
wallet, and iMessage.
Valuation Methodology
DCF and Economic Profit analysis
With our DCF and EP model we calculated an
intrinsic value share price of $178.48. We
believe this share price most accurately affects
the value of a current Apple share today. In our
models we projected all financial statements,
NOPLAT, and invested capital for our firm.
Revenue Assumptions
For our revenue growth projections, we closely
aligned our revenue projections with FactSet
consensus. We forecasted growth to align with
consensus for the fIRSt three years. We
Forecasted 2024 growth at 1%, 2025 at 6.4%,
and 2026 at 5.60%. We then increased our
revenue projection to 9.6% in 2027 due to
growth in demand for Apples products and the
integration of AI. After that, we stepPEd down
revenue to 7.33% in 2033.
Cost of Goods Sold
Apple's COGS as a PErcentage of sales ranged
from 50%-55% from 2019-2022. In 2023 it
was 52.86%. We projected COGS by taking
the average past 5 years COGS as a PErcentage
of sales and multiplied it by our revenue
forecasts.
R&D ExPEnse
Apple typically has a R&D exPEnse that has
steadily increased as a % of sales although
2023 and was at 7.80%. Since R&D can vary
based on technological advancements, we
12
decided to directly tie it to sales. We projected
R&D by taking the average past 5 years R&D
as a PErcentage of sales and multiplied it by
our revenue forecasts.
Cost of Equity
We	applied	the	CAPM	model	to	estimate
Apple's	cost	of	equity,	selecting	the	yield	of
the	US	10-year	Treasury	bond	as	our	riskfree	rate.	We	incorporated	Aswath
Damodaran's	implied	market	risk	premium
for	April	2024.	Additionally,	we	used	the	5year	monthly	raw	beta	for	Apple	from
Bloomberg	as	our	beta	value.	Using	these
inputs,	we	determined	that	Apple's	cost	of
equity	is	10.11%
WACC
For our WACC we calculated the cost of
equity to be 10.11% and the after-tax cost of
debt to be 4.25% for Apple. Apple has a capital
structure of 95.53% equity and 4.47% debt.
With these inputs we were able to calculate
WACC for Apple. We used the WACC to
discount all our projected cash flows back to
today to compute the present value. This
ultimately gave us an intrinsic value of
$177.27 PEr share.
Relative Valuation Analysis
Our relative valuation we computed a share
price of 143.57 for 2024 and 137.00 for 2025.
The companies we included were all
companies that comPEte with apple and are
relatively similar size. The companies were
Microsoft, Alphabet Inc., HP Inc., Amazon,
Samsung, and Dell Technologies. Apple
currently has a forward 2024 P/E of 28. This is
a little higher compared to other players in the
average which averaged 23.92. We exPEct
Apple to continue to be a dominate company in
the consumer electronics and the higher P/E is
justified with their growth prosPEcts.
Dividend Discount Model
Our dividend discount model calculated the
intrinsic value share price of $125.60. We
projected Apple to increase its dividend by 5
cents PEr year. We projected 3% share
repurchase.
The reason we tested these variables
against each other is because they are both
crucial for determining the gross margins on
products and services for the company. We
tested both variables against the discounted cash
flow valuation model to see the effects of the
different cost structures on the intrinsic share
prices. From our analysis, as the cost of product
sales to 60.50%, the intrinsic share price rises to
$189 and as it rose to 66.50% the price falls to
$166. With the cost-of-service sales; as it
increases to 32.17% the price is at $172 and as
it falls to 26.17%, the price rises to $183. The
fluctuation in the two cost structures show the
risk associated with each. By adjusting the costof-service sales there is far less risk and
deviation than with adjusting the cost of product
sales. By adjusting the two costs of sales, we
estimate that the stock price to fall between
$160-$194.
Risk Free Rate and CV NOPLAT Growth
We used the risk-free rate and the CV of
NOPLAT growth because we wanted
to
evaluate the sensitivity that a higher or lower
risk-free rate would have on a large company
with steady profit growth like Apple. From our
analysis, we noticed that as the risk-free rate
increases, the intrinsic share price decreases
significantly and as the risk-free rate decreases,
the intrinsic share price rises significantly. We
believe this to remain constant with the whole
market. As the risk-free rate increases, investors
are going to be looking for safer investments
because they exPEct higher returns and there are
safer options such as government bonds.
However, for a company that is the size of
Apple which has a proven track record of profit
growth, they will be far less affected than
smaller, riskier businesses. Apple's NOPLAT
growth is somewhat predictable, and investors
14
know what to exPEct which can mitigate some
of the risks. This is relevant currently because
risk free rates are high (4.63% as of 4/15/24),
and we wanted to measure the effects. In terms
of the CV of NOPLAT growth; as NOPLAT
growth rises, so does the intrinsic share price
and as it falls, the intrinsic share price also falls.
With our analysis for the sensitivity of the two
variables, we estimate the stock price to fall
between $168-$208.
CV NOPLAT Growth and WACC
We chose to analyze the CV of NOPLAT
growth and the WACC because they are the two
main variables in the discounted cash flow
valuation. The continuing value of NOPLAT
accounts for most of the discounted cash flow
valuation and we wanted to test the sensitivity
of these variables and their effects on our
valuation model. Our estimation for the CV of
NOPLAT growth is at 5%, due to Apple's
strong track record and plethora of resources.
Apple's projection PEriod cash flows and the
CV of NOPLAT is discounted by the WACC,
and from our analysis we found that our
valuational model had a very high sensitivity to
these two factors.
We tested the WACC from the range of 9.32%
to 9.92% and the CV of NOPLAT growth from
4.70% to 5.30%. From this analysis, we also
found that the as the CV NOPLAT growth
increased, the intrinsic stock price increased and
as the WACC increased the intrinsic stock price
decreased. The final share price from our
valuation has a high sensitivity to these
variables and we found
these
variables, the intrinsic stock price falls between
$168 and $210.
that from
discounted cash flow valuation, we found
insights into the stock's intrinsic value. From
our analysis, we found that a downward
adjustment of the cost of equity to 9.59%
doesn't affect the intrinsic price by much and
only lowers the intrinsic price by less than a
dollar. An increase in the cost of equity to
10.19% doesn't affect the intrinsic value much
at all either, raising the value by less than a
dollar. Interestingly, manipulating the pre-tax
cost of debt, following Apple's corporate bond
fluctuations, also yields marginal effects on the
intrinsic share price. There are no significant
changes in the intrinsic value with this variable
as well. This shows the resilience of Apple's
debt-related
valuation
parameters and provides evidence of Apple's
strong financial position.

Beta and Equity Risk Premium
In the discounted cash flow analysis and the
dividend discount model, we found that the beta
and the equity risk premium were crucial
metrics
for valuation. We conducted a
sensitivity test on these variables to understand
the volatility of Apple's intrinsic share value in
response to changing these assumptions in
terms of the cost of equity. From our analysis,
we found that lowering the Beta to 0.99
increases Apple's intrinsic value to $238,
indicating lower risk. Raising it to 1.59 leads to
a downside risk, with Apple's intrinsic share
value droPPIng to $141. Decreasing the equity
risk premium to 4.03% signals lower risk to
Apple's cash flows, pushing the intrinsic share
value to $191. Conversely, an increase to 4.63%
leads to a price decline to $164. Both variables
significantly impact the discounted cash flow
model and based on our assumptions, the
intrinsic value is subject to a significant amount
of volatility if these metrics are altered.
Cost of Equity and Pre-Tax Cost of Debt
In assessing Apple's stock, it is crucial to look at
the dynamics of its cost of equity and pre-tax
cost of debt, as these factors significantly
influence our cash flow discount rate. This also
