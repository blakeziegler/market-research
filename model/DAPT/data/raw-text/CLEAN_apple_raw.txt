Five Year Stock Performance
Economic Analysis
Economic Outlook
Consumer Confidence Index
Measures optimism or pessimism consumers feel about the economy. March reading was 104.7, nearly unchanged from February’s 104.8. While confidence is historically high, it has not reached pre-pandemic levels. We expect flat trends through Q2 2024, with rate cuts in 2025 helping confidence return to pre-pandemic norms. For Apple, this has a neutral impact for 2025. As innovation continues, Apple can price products higher and retain demand.
10-Year Treasury Yield (Interest Rates)
The Fed has kept rates at 5.25%-5.50% to fight inflation, raising Treasury borrowing costs and increasing the cost of capital. This environment may decrease consumer spending and reduce corporate investment. Apple’s strong balance sheet allows it to handle elevated borrowing costs. We expect rate cuts to begin in September 2024 (targeting 5.00%-5.25%) and reach 4.00%-4.25% by the end of 2025. While this will ease capital costs, Treasury yields will stay relatively high, impacting Apple’s capital expenditures strategy. Apple is more likely to acquire or partner in AI than rely solely on internal R&D.
Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
Real GDP reflects inflation-adjusted economic output. It is vital to tech as it influences investment, spending, and innovation. Historically, tech thrives when GDP grows. In 2023, GDP rose 2.5% despite high interest rates. We forecast 1.5%-2.0% GDP growth in 2024 due to softening consumer spending. We expect GDP to grow 3.0% in 2025, stabilizing thereafter. As tech is cyclical, this GDP growth will support investment and demand for innovation.
Generative AI Impact
Generative AI could add 9% to global industry revenue. It has potential impacts on banking (5%), pharma (5%), and education (4%). Yet some experts predict the AI bubble may burst. NYU professor Gary Marcus notes the sector spent $50B on Nvidia chips in 2023 but generated only $3B in revenue. The gap between promise and delivery may limit short-term growth.
Still, fast followers like Apple may benefit by avoiding first-mover pitfalls. Learning from pioneers enables better execution and timing.
PC Market Trends
Due to macro headwinds and weak catalysts, PC shipments fell 14.1% in 2023 but are expected to rebound 6.4% in 2024 and 6.6% in 2025. The 2021 PC boom won’t be replicated soon, but education adoption leaves the market stronger than pre-pandemic. A new refresh cycle is expected by 2024. Current inventory overhang should clear by end-2023.
AI Investment Trends
Investors funneled $29.1B into 700 generative AI deals in 2023, a 260% YoY increase. Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta lead the market cap in AI. Though Apple appears behind, it is developing MM1, a generative AI model optimized for on-device use. News of AI-focused M4 Macs boosted Apple stock by 4.3% and added $112B in value. AI remains a key growth vector for Apple and others integrating AI into products and operations.
Inflation and Interest Rates
A recent BLS report showed a surprise 0.4% CPI increase, dampening hopes for rate cuts. High rates typically hurt growth stock valuations. Still, the S&P 500 rose 0.7% driven by Big Tech gains. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) rose 2%, led by Apple and Nvidia gains of over 4%.
In China, foreign consumers may influence pricing pressure to maintain product appeal.
Threat of Substitutes: Moderate
Apple’s deeply integrated ecosystem ensures seamless experiences across devices and services. Google attempts to replicate this with its Pixel line: Pixel 8 phone, Pixel Watch, Pixel Buds, and Nest smart home devices. However, Google’s offerings remain less exclusive and lack full service integration. While not exact substitutes, rival ecosystems like Google’s represent credible alternatives and moderate threats.
Industry Leaders and Followers
Industry Positioning
Catalysts for Growth or Change
Augmented Reality & Virtual Reality (AR/VR)
2023 was weak for AR/VR with global headset shipments falling 23.5%. A rebound is forecasted in 2024, with expected shipment growth of 44.2% to 9.7M units. Early skepticism around Meta’s Metaverse hindered adoption, but Apple Vision Pro reignited interest in immersive tech. Meta’s Quest 3 and Ray-Ban smart glasses also received positive reviews, pushing momentum forward.
IDC projects global VR headset shipments to hit 24.7M by 2028, implying a strong five-year CAGR. Apple is well-positioned to lead in the AR/VR resurgence due to ecosystem integration, high-end brand positioning, and growing public interest in wearable mixed-reality devices.
The AR/VR segment, previously sluggish, is gaining traction again through premium innovation, stronger content pipelines, and improved hardware experiences. As Apple refines its Vision Pro offering and expands software and service compatibility, it may emerge as a key growth driver across its broader device and content portfolio.
As consumer preferences shift toward immersive, portable, and connected experiences, Apple’s continued innovation in AR/VR aligns with longer-term tech adoption trends and could generate incremental revenues beyond iPhones and MacBooks.
Apple’s tight ecosystem, high brand equity, and strategic investments in AI and AR/VR make it a resilient player even in the face of intensifying global tech competition.
(CAGR) of 29.2% as the consumer base slowly grows beyond core gaming use cases and as businesses adopt more headsets for training, design, and more. On the other hand, AR headsets are expected to grow from a smaller base of less than a million units in 2024 to 10.9 million in 2028, representing an 87.1% CAGR over the same period. However, we are still far from mainstream adoption of AR/VR headsets due to two reasons: hefty price tags attached to them and the hardware limitations of these AR/VR headsets that might hinder a seamless consumer experience.
Compact Wearable Devices
There is a shift of consumer preference towards discrete, hands-free screenless technology that integrates seamlessly into daily life. Wearables have made huge advances in sensor technology, providing consumers with large amounts of data and insights about their health and wellness. From potentially detecting chronic diseases like AFib to measuring stress levels and tracking sleep, wearables have far surpassed their original role as basic step trackers. Because of their ability to help consumers make data more actionable, adoption is expected to rise. In 2022, the global wearable technology market was valued at $61.3 billion and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 14.6% from 2023 to 2030.

Strengths
Apple’s greatest strength is its strong brand recognition supported by consistent marketing excellence. The company continues to be one of the world’s most valuable brands, with a brand value of about $880.5 billion in 2023. It has also consistently won the CMO Survey Award for Marketing Excellence for ten consecutive years, making Apple one of the greatest marketers of all time. Apple has perfected the art of minimalism by stripping its products down to their fundamentals. Products have simple, clean lines, with even simpler, self-explanatory names. This simplicity makes products easy to use and accessible to non-experts. Furthermore, Apple has empowered customers who “think differently,” inspiring users to act creatively and independently. As Apple’s user base expands, the company has worked to maintain this focus by fostering a sense of community across artists, businesses, and students. To spark interest among future customers, Apple offers youth initiatives such as free coding workshops.
Weaknesses
Apple is overly dependent on its iPhone sales, which accounted for over 58% of the company’s total revenue in the first quarter of FY2020. Relying heavily on a single product line increases the risk exposure to economic fluctuations, shifts in consumer preferences, and industry disruption. This reliance threatens both revenue and profitability. Diversifying Apple’s product portfolio and revenue streams is critical to mitigating risk, stabilizing cash flows, and ensuring resilience against market volatility.
Opportunities
The ongoing AI race presents significant opportunities for Apple. Apple has not yet integrated AI-powered features into its flagship smartphones, thus has untapped potential in this space. Apple plans to introduce “on-device” AI capabilities, meaning its large language models would operate without cloud processing. According to Counterpoint Research, 1 billion GenAI smartphones are projected to be shipped between 2024 and 2027, with GenAI devices expected to comprise 11% of all shipments in 2024 and 43% by 2027. Apple is forecasted to lead OEM rankings for GenAI smartphones by 2025.
Threats
Apple faces escalating legal threats, particularly from antitrust and anti-competitive lawsuits. It was sued by Epic Games in 2020 and more recently by the Department of Justice in 2024. These cases forced Apple to give up features that once provided competitive advantages. In response to the Epic Games suit, Apple revised App Store rules, allowing developers targeting U.S. users to direct customers to external sites for payments. With the DOJ case, Apple may lose control over restrictions related to superapps, cloud gaming, smartwatches, digital wallets, and iMessage.
Valuation Methodology
We used a DCF and Economic Profit (EP) model to derive an intrinsic share price of $178.48. This valuation reflects the estimated present value of Apple shares. The models included full projections of financial statements, NOPLAT, and invested capital.
Revenue Assumptions
We aligned revenue projections with FactSet consensus estimates: 2024 growth at 1%, 2025 at 6.4%, and 2026 at 5.6%. Growth was then increased to 9.6% in 2027 to reflect strong demand and AI integration, and tapered to 7.33% by 2033.
Cost of Goods Sold
Apple’s historical COGS ranged from 50% to 55% of sales between 2019 and 2022. In 2023, it was 52.86%. We projected COGS as a percentage of revenue based on the five-year historical average.
R&D Expense
Apple’s R&D has steadily grown as a share of revenue, reaching 7.80% in 2023. Since R&D intensity varies with innovation cycles, we projected R&D as a percentage of revenue using the five-year average.
Cost of Equity
We applied the CAPM model to estimate Apple’s cost of equity. The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield was used as the risk-free rate, and Aswath Damodaran’s April 2024 implied market risk premium was incorporated. Apple’s five-year monthly raw beta from Bloomberg served as the beta value. These inputs resulted in an estimated cost of equity of 10.11%.

WACC
For our WACC, we calculated Apple’s cost of equity to be 10.11% and the after-tax cost of debt to be 4.25%. With a capital structure composed of 95.53% equity and 4.47% debt, we used these inputs to compute Apple’s WACC. This WACC was then used to discount all projected cash flows back to their present value, resulting in an intrinsic share value of $177.27.
Relative Valuation Analysis
In our relative valuation, we estimated a share price of $143.57 for 2024 and $137.00 for 2025. The peer group included companies similar in size and in direct competition with Apple: Microsoft, Alphabet Inc., HP Inc., Amazon, Samsung, and Dell Technologies. Apple’s forward 2024 P/E is 28, which is slightly higher than the peer average of 23.92. We believe this higher P/E is justified by Apple’s strong growth prospects and dominance in consumer electronics.
Dividend Discount Model
Our dividend discount model yielded an intrinsic share price of $125.60. We projected Apple would increase its dividend by 5 cents per year and continue share repurchases at a 3% annual rate.
Cost Structure Sensitivity Analysis
We tested the impact of varying cost structures on the DCF valuation model. As the cost of product sales rose to 66.50%, the intrinsic share price declined to $166, whereas a drop to 60.50% raised the price to $189. Similarly, with the cost of service sales, an increase to 32.17% resulted in a price of $172, while a decrease to 26.17% lifted the price to $183. Our findings suggest the intrinsic share price is more sensitive to changes in product sales costs than service sales, with the total valuation likely ranging between $160 and $194.
Risk-Free Rate and CV NOPLAT Growth
We analyzed how variations in the risk-free rate and the coefficient of variation (CV) of NOPLAT growth impact Apple’s intrinsic value. As the risk-free rate increases, intrinsic value decreases, and vice versa. This relationship aligns with general market behavior as investors prefer safer assets with higher returns, like government bonds, when risk-free rates are elevated. However, Apple’s consistent profit growth makes it less vulnerable to these shifts compared to smaller firms. With current rates at 4.63% (as of 4/15/24), this sensitivity is especially relevant. Likewise, as CV NOPLAT growth rises, so does intrinsic value, and it falls when growth declines. Our model suggests the stock price fluctuates between $168 and $208 based on these variables.
CV NOPLAT Growth and WACC Interaction
Given that continuing value accounts for a significant portion of a DCF model, we assessed the sensitivity of both CV NOPLAT growth and WACC. Apple’s CV NOPLAT growth was projected at 5%, justified by its track record and substantial resources. We tested WACC in the range of 9.32% to 9.92% and CV NOPLAT growth from 4.70% to 5.30%. An increase in CV NOPLAT growth leads to a higher intrinsic share price, while an increase in WACC results in a lower price. From this, the expected share price ranges between $168 and $210.
Discount Rate Component Analysis
In further sensitivity analysis, we found that adjusting Apple’s cost of equity from 10.11% down to 9.59% or up to 10.19% results in less than a $1 change in intrinsic value, indicating low sensitivity. Similarly, changes to the pre-tax cost of debt—linked to corporate bond rates—had marginal effects on the valuation, demonstrating the strength and stability of Apple’s financial structure.
Beta and Equity Risk Premium Impact
We found beta and equity risk premium to be critical to the DCF and DDM models. Lowering beta to 0.99 raised intrinsic value to $238 due to reduced risk, while raising beta to 1.59 dropped it to $141. Decreasing the equity risk premium to 4.03% raised the value to $191, while increasing it to 4.63% decreased the value to $164. These variables significantly influence the discount rate and reflect substantial valuation volatility when altered.
Cost of Equity and Pre-Tax Cost of Debt
To fully understand Apple’s valuation, we analyzed the effect of its cost of equity and pre-tax cost of debt on the DCF and DDM models. These variables drive the discount rate used for valuing future cash flows. Sensitivity testing confirmed that the impact of changes to either is limited, providing further evidence of Apple’s financial resilience and stability in valuation models.
