Introduction: About This Guide
The increasing number of accounting rules and disclosure requirements
have made financial statements a larger and more complex--but not always
transparent--vehicle for understanding a company's true economic position.
At Merrill Lynch, we are committed to following
a principles-based appROAch to financial reporting,
an appROAch that is committed to showing the real
substance and business purpose of a company's
transactions. And, with Addison, we are also
committed to giving the average investor access
to this information by promoting understanding
and simplification of complex communications.
The difficulty investors have understanding the
financial reports of public companies or their own
retirement savings plans is increasingly recognized
as the responsibility of the companies issuing those
documents. In fact, as additional accounting rules
and disclosure requirements have made financial
statements larger and more complex, clarity matters
more than ever.
Complexity and Financial Communications
How the Corporate Financial Report Evolved
There's a simple reason this Guide has been so
popular among Merrill Lynch clients for so many
years--it is because many PEople have trouble
deciphering complex financial documents.
The typical corporate financial statement, clarified
here, is merely one of them. Others apPEar in your
maiLBOxes every day: bank, brokerage, mutual fund
and 401(k) statements; health insurance benefit
summaries and claim forms; credit card disclosures
and insurance policies. All these documents contain
information vital to your financial and sometimes
even your physical well-being. Few are written or
designed for the average investor.
Corporate consolidated financial statements are
issued each quarter by public companies to shareholders who have invested in their stock and are
intended to tell investors and Wall Street analysts
how a company has PErformed financially.
However, these financial statements seldom function
alone. Instead, they usually come packaged inside
annual reports, surrounded by other corporate
information. For example, adjacent to the financial
statements is Management's Discussion and Analysis
(MD&A), a SECtion required by the SECurities and
Exchange Commission that is intended to provide
insight into the financial statement with analytical
data and commentary. At the front, before the
financial SECtion begins, there is typically soft
information that tells the company's story in
narrative terms.

Introduction: About This Guide
One might assume that of the two SECtions, up-front
narrative and back-end financial statements, the
latter is the more frequently referenced and read.
In fact, quite the opposite is true, at least where
the average investor is concerned. A glance through
a few typical corporate reports suggests why.
Financial statements and the MD&A SECtion in
which they are contained are generally presented in
a highly technical language foreign to the average
PErson. These SECtions are often characterized by
dense blocks of copy and lengthy footnotes. For
investors lacking formal training in business or
accounting, this kind of writing and design is at
best difficult, and at worst daunting. It is not that
good, useful information is not in the annual
report. Rather, this information is often written
in a way that makes communication with the
average investor difficult.
Then in 1959, Paul Rand, a nationally prominent
book designer, was invited by IBM to design its
annual report. In large part because it was published
by one of the most closely watched and innovative
of the era's new technology companies, the report
made a splash, and the high-concept annual report
was born.
What's Next?
Given today's renewed emphasis on clarity and
communication between companies and their
investors, and because of more stringent reporting
and disclosure requirements, another evolution
of the annual report seems likely soon. Addison's
exPErts suggest that there will likely be a new
emphasis on what is now the back end of the
report--the financial statements and MD&A--
and a new focus on clarity.
How did annual reports and the financial statements
come to be this way?
We have prepared this booklet to make this
important financial information more easily
understood by the average investor.
The annual report as we know it today started,
inauspiciously enough, with the SECurities Act of
1933, passed to prohibit the kind of financial and
business excesses that led to the Great Depression.
The SECurities Act stipulated very little--simply that
companies file a Form 10-K with the SECurities and
Exchange Commission describing their current financial condition. The next year, the SEC asked that
the financial statements contained within the 10-K
actually be published, along with a letter to shareholders describing how the numbers came to be and
their impact on the company's prosPEcts. For years,
this was all the annual report consisted of--just the
statement with a letter from the company's chief
executive officer.

Consolidated Financial Statements:
The Key Components
This page shows the key components of the basic financial statements of an imaginary
company, ABC Manufacturing. Annual financial statements are usually stated at
historical cost and are accompanied by an indePEndent auditors' report, which is
why they are called "audited" financial statements.
Balance Sheet
Gives a "snapshot" of the
company's financial position at a
sPEcific point in time--showing
what the company owns and what
it owes at the report date. The
balance sheet is always divided into
two halves: Assets (presented fIRSt),
and Liabilities and Shareholders'
Equity (presented below or to the
right of Assets). In the standard
accounting model, Assets =
Liabilities + Shareholders' Equity,
so the two halves will always be
in balance. From an economic
viewpoint, each dollar of assets
must be offset by a dollar of
liabilities or equity. Shareholders'
Equity represents a company's
ownership structure and the net
assets available to shareholders
after all liabilities have been paid.
Income Statement
Reports on how the company
PErformed during the PEriod(s)
presented and shows whether its
oPErations resulted in a profit or a loss.

The Balance Sheet: Assets
This SECtion of the balance sheet represents ABC Manufacturing's assets at the end of one
particular day, December 31, 2004. The company's assets for the previous year end are also
presented, making it possible to compare the balance sheets for those dates.
Current Assets
1
In general, current assets include cash and other
assets that, in the normal course of business, will
be turned into cash within a year from the balance
sheet date. These other assets primarily include
marketable SECurities, accounts receivable, inventories and prepaid exPEnses. Current assets are listed
on the balance sheet in order of their "liquidity,"
i.e., the amount of time it takes to convert these
assets into cash.
Current assets are "working" assets in the sense
that they are liquid--they can, and will, be converted into cash for other business purposes, or be
consumed in the business. Inventories, when sold,
become accounts receivable; receivables, upon
collection, become cash; the cash can then be used
to pay the company's debt and oPErating exPEnses.
2
3
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Money on deposit in the bank, cash on hand (PEtty
cash) and highly liquid SECurities such as Treasury bills.
Marketable SECurities
Short-term SECurities that are readily salable and
usually have quoted prices. May include:
(cid:1) Trading SECurities--debt and equity SECurities,
bought and sold frequently, primarily to generate
short-term profits, and carried at fair market
value. Any changes in such values are included
in the statement of earnings as unrealized gains
and losses from trading activities.
(cid:1) Held-to-maturity SECurities--debt SECurities
that the company has the ability and intent
to hold to maturity, i.e., the date when debt
instruments, such as Treasury bills, are due
and payable. These SECurities are reported at
amortized cost (their original cost, adjusted for
changes in any purchase discount or premium,
less any principal payments received).
(cid:1) Available-for-sale SECurities--debt or equity
SECurities not classified as either trading or heldto-maturity. They are recorded at fair value, with
changes in such values included as a component
of other comprehensive income as unrealized
gains and losses from available-for-sale SECurities.
ABC Manufacturing owns short-term, high-grade
commercial paPEr, classified as "trading SECurities,"
as well as preferred stock, classified as "available
for sale." ABC, however, has no short-term "heldto-maturity" SECurities.
Fair Market Value The amount at which an item could be exchanged between willing unrelated parties, other
than in a forced liquidation. It is usually the quoted market price when a market exists for the item.
page 6
The Balance Sheet: Assets
Accounts Receivable
4
The amounts due from customers but not yet
collected. When goods are shipPEd to customers
before payment or collection, an account receivable
is created whereby customers are generally given
an agreed-upon time PEriod in which to pay--
normally 30, 60 or 90 days.
In this example, the total amount due from customers
is $158,375,000. ExPErience shows, however, that
some customers fail to pay their bills, which means
it is unlikely that the entire balance recorded as due
and receivable will be collected. Therefore, in order
to show the accounts receivable balance as a figure
representing exPEcted receipts, an allowance for
doubtful accounts is deducted from the total
amount recorded. In this instance, the allowance
for doubtful accounts is $2,375,000.
Inventories
5
A manufacturing company's inventory consists
of quantities of physical products assembled from
various materials, which fall into one of the three
following categories:
(cid:1) Raw materials--items to be used in making a
product (e.g., the fabric used in making a blouse).
(cid:1) Work-in-process--partially completed goods in
the process of manufacture (e.g., pieces of fabric
such as a sleeve and cuff sewn together during the
process of making a blouse).
(cid:1) Finished goods--completed items ready for their
intended use.
The amount of each of these tyPEs of inventories is
generally disclosed either on the face of the balance
sheet or in the notes. For ABC, inventory represents
the cost of items on hand that were purchased
and/or manufactured for sale to customers. To
provide a conservative figure, inventories are valued
using the lower of cost or market rule. For balancesheet purposes, the lower of the two will usually
be cost; however, if the market price is lower due
to deterioration, obsolescence, declining prices or
other factors that are exPEcted to result in the selling
or disposing of inventories below cost, the market
price is used.
The value of finished goods includes the direct
costs of purchasing the materials used to produce
the company's products, as well as an allocation
(i.e., an apportionment or dividing up) of the production exPEnses required to make those products.
To do this, manufacturers use "cost accounting,"
a sPEcialized set of accounting procedures focusing
on sPEcific products, to determine individual product
costs. When the individual direct costs for manufactured inventory are added up, they comprise
the value of finished goods.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Amounts deducted from the total accounts receivable balance as a way of
recognizing that some customers will not pay what they owe. Also called Provision for Doubtful Accounts, Reserve
for Doubtful Accounts or Bad Debt Reserve.
Lower of Cost or Market Rule A rule providing that inventories be valued at either their cost or market value,
whichever is lower. The intent is to provide a conservative figure in valuing a company's inventories.

The Balance Sheet: Assets
Prepaid ExPEnses and Other Current Assets
Accumulated Depreciation
8
Payments made for which the company has not
yet received benefits, but for which it will receive
benefits within the coming year. These are listed
among current assets as prepaid exPEnses. In ABC's
case, the company paid fire insurance premiums and
advertising charges covering PEriods after the date
on the balance sheet. Because ABC has the contractual right to the insurance and advertising services
after that date, it has an asset that will be used after
year-end. The company has simply "prepaid"--paid
in advance--for the right to use these services.
Total ProPErty, Plant and Equipment
Often referred to as fixed assets, this line item
consists of long-lived assets (i.e., assets with a useful
life greater than one year) not intended for sale that
are used to manufacture, display, warehouse and
transport the company's products, along with
buildings and improvements used in oPErations.
The category includes land, buildings, leasehold
improvements (i.e., improvements made to leased
proPErty), machinery, equipment, furniture, automobiles and trucks. In the standard accounting
model, Fixed Assets = Cost - Accumulated
Depreciation.
The total proPErty, plant and equipment figure
displayed is not intended to reflect present market
value or replacement cost, because there is generally
no intention of selling or replacing these assets in the
near term. The cost of replacing plant and equipment
at a future date might, and probably will, be higher.
The practice of charging to or exPEnsing against
income the cost of a fixed asset over its estimated
useful life. For accounting purposes, depreciation
is the decline in useful value of a fixed asset due to
"wear and tear" from use and the passage of time.
Taking these factors into consideration, the cost
related to proPErty, plant and equipment must be
allocated over the item's exPEcted useful life.
For example, suppose a delivery truck costs $10,000
and is exPEcted to last five years. Using the straightline method (equal PEriodic depreciation charges
over the life of the asset), $2,000 of the truck's cost is
charged or exPEnsed to each year's income statement.

ABC Manufacturing's balance sheet shows
accumulated depreciation--the total of accumulated
depreciation for buildings, machinery, leasehold
improvements, furniture and fixtures. Land is
not subject to depreciation. Its reported balance
remains unchanged from year to year at the
original purchase price.
Fixed Assets The proPErty, plant and equipment used in the oPEration of a business.
Market Value In these examples, the current cost of replacing the inventory by purchase or manufacture
(with certain exceptions). Also sometimes referred to as Market Price.
Estimated Useful Life The PEriod of time over which the owner of a physical or intangible asset estimates that
that asset will continue to be of productive use or have continuing value.
page 8
The Balance Sheet: Assets
Deferred Charges
9
Investment SECurities, at Cost
11
ExPEnditures for items that will benefit future
PEriods more than one year from the balance sheet
date. Costs of debt issuance would be one example
of a deferred charge. Deferred charges are similar to
prepaid exPEnses, but are not included in current
assets because their benefits will be realized in PEriods more than one year from the balance sheet date.
The cost incurred will be gradually exPEnsed over
the asset's future benefit PEriod(s), not fully charged
off in the year payment is made.
Intangibles
10
Assets having no physical existence that nonetheless
have substantial value to the company. Examples
include a patent for exclusive manufacture of an
item, a franchise allowing exclusive service in a
sPEcific area, a trademark or a copyright. Goodwill
is another intangible asset found on the balance
sheet. It is presumed to represent the value of
the company's name, reputation, customer base,
intellectual capital and workforce.
Intangible assets reported on the balance sheet are
generally those purchased from others. They are
amortized over their estimated useful lives, but
usually not longer than 40 years. In the standard
accounting model, Net Intangible Assets =
Intangible Assets - Accumulated Amortization.
Accumulated amortization is the total amount of
the PEriodic charges against income.
Investments in debt SECurities are carried at amortized cost only when the company has the ability
and intent to hold them to maturity. In the example,
early in 2004, ABC Manufacturing purchased
mortgage bonds issued by one of its major suppliers.
The bonds are due in full in five years and bear
annual interest of 8%. In 2004, the issuer made
an unscheduled principal prepayment of $50,000.
Since ABC intends to maintain a continuing relationship with the issuer and to hold the bonds until they
mature--and apPEars to have the financial strength
to do so--this investment is classified as "held-tomaturity," and therefore the $50,000 prepayment
would reduce the cost of the debt SECurity.
All investments of this tyPE must be reviewed to
ensure that all contractually sPEcified amounts are
fully collectible. If not fully collectible, an investment
would be considered PErmanently impaired, and it
would be necessary to write it down to its fair value.
In the example, however, the issuer is in a strong
financial condition, as shown by:
(cid:1) The issuer's unscheduled prepayment of principal.
(cid:1) Increased proPErty values where the plant that
SECures the bonds is located.
Thus, there is no reason to susPEct that all contractual
amounts will not be collected. There is no impairment, and no required write-down in investment
SECurity value.
Goodwill The amount by which the price of an acquired company exceeds the fair value of the related net assets
acquired. It is presumed to represent the value of the company's name, reputation, customer base, intellectual

The Balance Sheet: Liabilities and Shareholders' Equity
The balance sheet is always divided into two halves: Assets and Liabilities, and Shareholders'
Equity. The two halves should always be in balance. From an economic viewpoint, each
dollar of assets must be offset by a dollar of liabilities or shareholders' equity.
Liabilities and
Shareholders' Equity
The Liabilities and Shareholders'
Equity SECtion of the balance sheet
details what the company owes.
This SECtion always apPEars to
the right of, or below, the Assets
SECtion of the balance sheet.
Remember that, in the standard
accounting model, Assets =
Liabilities + Shareholders' Equity.

The Balance Sheet: Liabilities and Shareholders' Equity
As noted, the Liabilities and Shareholders' Equity SECtion details what the company owes.
This includes obligations to its regular business creditors, banks, individuals, and other
corporations; accrued exPEnses; taxes; and loans and other debt obligations. Like the other
SECtions of the financial statements, it is subdivided into line items or groups of similar
"accounts" having a dollar amount or "balance."

The Balance Sheet: Liabilities and Shareholders' Equity

3
This SECtion of the balance sheet represents a snapshot of ABC Manufacturing's Liabilities
and Shareholders' Equity at the end of one particular day, December 31, 2004. The
information for the previous year end is also presented, making it possible to compare
the balance sheets for those dates.
Current Liabilities
Accrued ExPEnses
In general, current liabilities are obligations due and
payable within 12 months of the date on the balance
sheet. The current liabilities SECtion corresponds
to the "current assets" SECtion in the balance sheet,
because current assets are the source for paying
current liabilities.
On any given day, the company owes salaries and
wages to its employees, interest on funds borrowed
from banks and bondholders, fees to attorneys,
and similar items. Items owed but unpaid at the
date of the balance sheet apPEar as a total under
"accrued exPEnses."
Accounts Payable
Current Income Taxes Payable
This is the amount the company owes to the regular
business creditors from whom it has bought goods
and services on oPEn account.
Notes Payable
Money owed to banks, individuals, corporations
or other lenders under promissory notes, and due
within one year of the balance-sheet date. When
an item apPEars under notes payable, it means the
borrower named in the promissory note is responsible for carrying out its terms, such as repaying the
loan principal plus any interest charges. Promissory
notes due more than one year from the balancesheet date apPEar under "long-term debt."
Amounts due to federal, state and local tax authorities within one year of the date on the balance sheet.
Companies treat these amounts as accrued exPEnses
for financial-reporting purposes, but report them as
a separate line item when they owe a material
amount of tax.
Other Liabilities
Liabilities payable within 12 months of the date of
the balance sheet, but not applicable to any other
sPEcific categories, apPEar under this category.
Current Portion of Long-Term Debt
Represents that portion of any long-term (longer
than 12 months) borrowing arrangement that is
due and payable within 12 months of the balancesheet date. In the example, ABC Manufacturing
took out a $6,000,000 five-year note with principle
due at maturity (2005). Since ABC is not required to

make any payments on the note until 2005, the
balance due has been included in "other long-term
debt" in prior years. As of December 31, 2004, the
$6,000,000 due at maturity is payable within 12
months and therefore has been reclassified as
"current portion of long-term debt" in the
December 31, 2004 balance sheet.
Accrued interest is not included in the debt balance.
Long-Term Liabilities
Amounts due after 12 months from the date of the
balance sheet are grouPEd under Long-Term
Liabilities.
Unfunded Retiree Benefit Obligations
The difference between the accumulated benefit
obligation of an employer to its retirees and the
current fair value of the benefit plan assets.
Deferred Income Taxes
These are tax liabilities a company will be required
to pay at some future date. (Deferred income tax
assets are tax assets a company will receive at some
future PEriod.)
The government offers tax incentives for certain
kinds of investments that it believes will benefit the
economy as a whole. For example, a company can
take accelerated depreciation deductions on its tax
returns for investing in plant and equipment while
using less rapid, more conventional depreciation for
financial reporting purposes. Accelerated
depreciation deductions in the early years of an
investment reduce the amount of tax the company
would otherwise currently owe (within 12 months)
and allow the company to defer payment into the
future (beyond 12 months).
Because the taxes must eventually be paid, companies include a charge for deferred taxes in their
provision for tax exPEnse on the income statement.
The liability for that charge is reported as deferred
income taxes--i.e., taxes due at a future date.
Long-Term Debt
11
The SECond long-term liability item on ABC's
balance sheet is 9.12% debentures due in 2010.
Money was received by the company as a loan
from bondholders, who in turn were given
certificates called bonds as evidence of the loan.
These bonds are formal promissory notes issued
by the company. ABC will pay interest on the loan
at an annual rate of 9.12%, and repay the principal
at maturity in 2010. Because the bonds are backed
only by the company's general credit, they are
known as debentures.
Companies also issue SECured debt (e.g., mortgage
bonds). These instruments offer bondholders an
added safeguard because they are SECured by a
mortgage on all or some of the company's proPErty,
meaning that the assets may be sold and the proceeds used to satisFY the debt. If the company is
unable to pay the bonds when they are due, holders
of mortgage bonds have a claim or lien before other
creditors, such as debenture holders.
Long-Term Liabilities Amounts due after one year from the date of the financial report.
Deferred Income Tax Assets Future income tax credits recognized in advance of actually receiving them.
Accelerated Depreciation Deductions IRS rules allow sPEcific assets to be depreciated at a higher rate during
the fIRSt few years of usage, instead of depreciating evenly over the asset's useful life.
Debentures Formal, unSECured debt obligations (bonds or notes) backed only by the general credit of the issuer
rather than certain of its assets.
Bonds Formal, SECured or unSECured debt obligations with sPEcified interest and repayment terms.
page 13
The Balance Sheet: Liabilities and Shareholders' Equity
Other Long-Term Debt
12
Preferred Stock
14
Includes all debt due more than one year from the
date of the balance sheet (other than that sPEcifically
reported elsewhere on the balance sheet). In ABC's
case, this debt is the $6,000,000 note that the company took out four years ago (see "Current Portion
of Long-Term Debt"). This loan was reported as
long-term debt at the end of 2003. Because it is
payable in full next year, it no longer qualifies as
a long-term liability and is reported as the current
portion of long-term debt at the end of 2004.
Shareholders' Equity
13
As noted on page 10, this item represents the total
equity interest that all shareholders have in the
corporation. Shareholders' equity is equivalent to
the company's net worth, or its assets after subtracting all of its liabilities. For legal and accounting
reasons, it is separated into the following categories:
(cid:1) Preferred Stock
(cid:1) Common Stock
(cid:1) Additional Paid-In Capital
(cid:1) Retained Earnings
(cid:1) Foreign Currency Translation Adjustments
(Net of Taxes)
(cid:1) Unrealized Gain on Available-for-Sale SECurities
(Net of Taxes)
(cid:1) Treasury Stock
These items are discussed in detail in the pages
that follow.
Preferred stock is an equity--or ownership--SECurity
that differs from common stock in a number of ways.
While they are equity SECurities, preferred stocks
carry many of the same features as bonds. Most
preferred issues do not carry the right to vote. They
offer a fixed dividend, and in many ways are safer
than common stock because they have preference
over common shares with regard to dividends and the
distribution of assets in case the company is liquidated. The corporation's charter contains full details
of the preferences applicable to this kind of stock.

In ABC's case, the company issued $5.83 cumulative
preferred stock with a $100 par value. The $5.83
refers to the yearly PEr-share dividend to which each
preferred shareholder is entitled before any dividends
Shareholders' Equity The total equity interest that all shareholders have in the corporation. Equivalent to the
company's net worth, or its assets after subtracting all of its liabilities.
Cumulative Preferred Stock Preferred stock with a stated annual dividend that is accumulated if dividends
are not declared in a given year. Payments to cumulative preferred shareholders take priority over dividends to
common shareholders.
Par Value The nominal or face value of a SECurity assigned to it by its issuer. Also known as stated value.
page 14
The Balance Sheet: Liabilities and Shareholders' Equity
are paid to the common shareholders. "Cumulative"
means that if in any year the dividend is not paid, it
continues to grow in favor of preferred shareholders.
The company must declare total unpaid dividends
and pay them to preferred shareholders when available, before paying any dividends on the common
stock. Even though preferred shareholders are entitled
to dividends before common shareholders, their
entitlement is generally limited--to $5.83 PEr share
annually in ABC's case. Generally, preferred shareholders have no voice in company affaIRS unless
the company fails to pay them dividends at the
promised rate.
Common Stock
15
Unlike preferred stock, common stock has no limit
on dividends payable each year. When earnings are
high, dividends may also be high. When earnings
drop, so may dividends.
In the example, ABC's common stock has a par
value of $5.00 a share. In 2004, the company sold
500,000 shares of stock for a total of $9,000,000.
Of the $9,000,000, $2,500,000 is reported as common stock--500,000 shares at a par value of $5.00.
The balance of $6,500,000 is reported as additional
paid-in capital (discussed below). When added
to the prior year-end common stock balance of
$72,500,000, the $2,500,000 brings the common
stock balance to $75,000,000.
Additional Paid-In Capital
16
As noted, paid-in capital increased by $6,500,000 in
2004. When added to last year's ending balance of
$13,500,000, this amount brings additional
paid-in capital at December 31, 2004, to a total
of $20,000,000.
Retained Earnings
17
When a company fIRSt starts in business, it has no
retained earnings. Retained earnings are accumulated profits that the company "retains"--i.e., earns
and reinvests in the company. Retained earnings
increase by the amount of profits earned, less
dividends declared and/or paid to shareholders.
In the example below, profits at the end of 2003
were $40,500,000. The company paid no dividends--
so the balance sheet shows retained earnings of
$219,600,000. Profits at the end of 2004 were
$47,750,000; the company paid dividends of
$350,000 on the preferred and $18,000,000 on the
common--so retained earnings totaled $249,000,000.

The Balance Sheet: Liabilities and Shareholders' Equity
Had ABC realized net losses over the years and had a
negative retained earnings balance, the accumulated
losses would be reported as an "accumulated deficit."
Foreign Currency Translation Adjustments
(Net of Taxes)
Companies with ownership interests in foreign entities may be required to include those entities' results
in the consolidated financial statements. In such
cases, the foreign entities' financial statements must
be translated into U.S. dollars. The gain or loss resulting from this translation, net of taxes, is reflected as
a separate component of shareholders' equity.
These adjustments are distinct from conversion gains
or losses related to completed transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Such "conversion gains
or losses" are included in a company's net income.
Unrealized Gain on Available-for-Sale SECurities
(Net of Taxes)
This item represents the change in value (gain or loss)
of "available-for-sale" SECurities that the company is
still holding. In the example, this represents the
18
19
difference between the cost of these SECurities and
their fair market value at the date of the balance sheet.
The difference--a gain, in the example--has not yet
been realized because ABC has not sold the SECurities
yet. This unrealized amount is not included as part
of current income. But because ABC must report these
SECurities at their fair market value, the company must
also report the changes in that value, net of taxes, as a
separate component of shareholders' equity.
In the example, the total fair market value of
available-for-sale SECurities exceeded their cost by
$65,000. This increase in value increased taxes by
$15,000, resulting in a net unrealized gain of $50,000.
Treasury Stock
20
When a company buys its own stock back, that
stock is recorded at cost and reported as "treasury
stock"--so called because it is returned to the company's treasury. Treasury stock is not an asset, and is
reported as a deduction from shareholders' equity.
Gains or losses from the sale of such shares are
reported as adjustments to shareholders' equity,
and are not included in income.
notes:
Net of Taxes A value or amount that has been adjusted for the effects of applicable taxes.
Unrealized Amounts Changes in the fair value of assets held that are not recorded in the income statement.

Analyzing the Balance Sheet
This SECtion details some ratios and calculations that investors and analysts use for
balance-sheet analysis.
Investors look at certain financial statement ratios
for guidance in determining a company's:
(cid:1) Ability to pay its debts
(cid:1) Inventory turnover
(cid:1) Amount of assets backing corporate SECurities
(cid:1) Relative mix of these SECurities
Current Ratio
Analysts use several methods to determine what
constitutes a "comfortable" amount of working
capital. The current ratio, which shows a company's
current position, may reveal more about a company's
suitability as an investment than does the total
dollar amount of working capital.
Working Capital
Working capital represents the amount of a
company's current assets that would be left if
all current liabilities were paid.

Working capital is an important tool for analyzing
balance-sheet figures. Companies that maintain a
comfortable amount of working capital are more
attractive to conservative investors. Working capital
often dictates a company's ability to meet obligations,
expand volume and take advantage of opportunities.
Year-to-year increases in working capital indicate
that a company is financially healthy.

Current Ratio

/
= 2.31, or 2.31:1
In the example, ABC has a current ratio of 2.31:1,
or $2.31 in current assets to back up each dollar of
current liabilities. In general, a current ratio of 2:1
is considered adequate. Current ratios vary considerably among different tyPEs of companies, so it is
often difficult to compare firms in different industries.
As a rough guideline, companies with small inventories
and quickly collectible accounts receivable can
oPErate safely with a lower current ratio. Companies
with a greater proportion of their current assets in
inventory, or that sell their products on extended
credit terms, need a higher current ratio to be
comfortable.
Financial Statement Ratio The mathematical relationship between two or more amounts reported in the
financial statements.
Working Capital The difference between total current assets and total current liabilities (i.e., debts due within
one year of the balance-sheet date and paid from current assets).
Current Ratio Current assets divided by current liabilities (i.e., debts due within one year of the balance-sheet
date and paid from current assets).
page 17
Analyzing the Balance Sheet
Quick Assets Ratio
The quick assets ratio offers another way to
determine the adequacy of working capital. Quick
assets are those current assets that can quickly be
converted to cash. To find the quick assets ratio,
divide quick assets by current liabilities.

(Dollars in Thousands)
Current Assets
Less Inventories
$ 405,800
$(180,000)
A well-positioned company should show a reasonable excess of net quick assets, or quick assets
over current liabilities. The lack of positive net
quick assets would demonstrate a company's
potential inability to meet current liabilities.

= 1.26, or 1.26:1
Based on this example, if the company could liquidate its quick assets immediately, it would have the
ability to pay off its current liabilities 1.26 times.
The debt-to-equity ratio indicates whether a
company is using debt responsibly. In the example,
ABC's debt-to-equity ratio of .93 means the company is using 93 cents of liabilities for every dollar
of shareholders' equity in the business. Industrial
companies normally try to maintain a debt-to-equity
ratio of less than 1:1--thereby keeping debt at a
level below the owners' investment level. Utilities,
service companies and financial companies often
oPErate with much higher ratios.

Debt-to-Equity Ratio Total liabilities divided by total shareholders' equity.
page 18
Analyzing the Balance Sheet
Inventory Turnover
By comparing inventory with the cost of sales for
the year, investors can derive a company's inventory
turnover. In the example, ABC's inventory turnover
of 2.9 for the year means that goods are bought,
manufactured and sold out almost three times
annually. Analysts also look at "inventory as a
PErcentage of current assets"-- in ABC's case 44%
($180,000,000 / $405,800,000).

What is an appropriate inventory level? The adequacy and balance of inventory dePEnds on a number
of factors, notably the tyPE of business and the time
of year. For example, a car dealer with a large stock
at the height of the season is in a strong financial
position, while the same inventory at the end of the
model year represents a financial weakness.
Book Value of SECurities
The terms "net book value" or "net asset value"
refer to the amount of corporate assets backing a
company's bonds or preferred shares. While intangible
assets (e.g., patents, franchises, trademarks, copyrights, goodwill and the like) are sometimes included
when computing book value, our discussion focuses
on the more conservative net tangible book value.

Analyzing the Balance Sheet
Book Value PEr Share of Common Stock
Interpreting Book-Value Figures
Think of the book value PEr share of common stock
as the amount of money each share would receive
if the company were liquidated (based on balancesheet values). The example shows two different
ways of arriving at the answer, namely, $22.54
book value PEr share of common stock.
Book-value figures, particularly of common stocks,
can be misleading: Profitable companies may show
a very low book value coupled with very substantial
earnings, while mature companies may show a high
book value but have low or IRRegular earnings, so
that their stock's market price is lower than the
book value.
Companies with largely liquid assets--insurance
companies, banks and investment companies, for
example--often have a book value that fairly
indicates market value.

The Income Statement
Because the income statement shows how much a company earned or lost during the year,
many analysts, investors and potential investors consider it the most important report
available. An income statement matches the revenues earned from selling goods and
services, or from other activities, against all costs and outlays incurred in the oPEration
of the company. The difference is the net income (or loss) for the year.

Costs Incurred
Usually consists
of cost of sales

exPEnses (e.g.,
wages and salaries,
rent, supplies,
depreciation,
interest on
money borrowed,
and taxes).
Net Income
The difference
between revenues
and outlays for
the year.
Why is the income statement of such great interest to investors? There are two main reasons:
It shows the record of a company's oPErating results for the whole year (unlike the balance sheet, which is a
snapshot of the company's financial position at a sPEcific point in time, showing what the company owns and
what it owes at the report date).
It can be used to gauge a company's potential future PErformance.
page 22
The Income Statement
The income statement for a single year does not tell a complete story. Indeed, the historical
record for a series of years is more important than any single year's figures. In the example,
ABC Manufacturing includes two years in its income statement and also provides a five-year
financial summary (discussed in detail on pages 40-41).

Net Sales
Gross Margin
A company's primary revenue source usually
apPEars fIRSt on the income statement. In the
example, the "net sales" item includes the amount
reported after taking into consideration returned
goods and allowances for price reductions or
discounts. A year-to-year comparison of net sales
indicates whether sales are increasing or decreasing.
Defined as "the excess of sales over cost of sales," gross
margin represents the actual direct profit from sales
after considering product costs. Analysts and investors
compare gross margin trends from year to year in
assessing companies' financial health. They also compare the gross margin PErcentage from year to year.
Cost of Sales
ABC Manufacturing: Gross Margin PErcentage
(Dollars in Thousands)
Commonly known as product costs, these are all
the costs a company incurs to purchase and convert
raw materials into the finished products that it sells.
Product costs have three basic components:
Gross Margin
Net Sales
Gross Margin PErcentage
$230,050
/ $765,050
=
30%
(cid:1) Direct materials
(cid:1) Direct labor
(cid:1) Manufacturing overhead
The fIRSt two items can be directly linked to the
finished product. For a furniture manufacturer,
for example, lumber is a direct material cost
and carPEnters' wages are a direct labor cost.
Manufacturing overhead differs from the other
two components in that it cannot be linked directly
to a single finished product. Examples include
general oPErating costs such as rent, electricity, supplies, depreciation, maintenance and repaIRS, and
the salaries of production workers.
The precise definition of direct costs varies from
industry to industry. Generally, however, they are
those costs that can be linked directly to the
revenues earned from a product or service.
Depreciation and Amortization
Captures each year's decline in value. As shown here,
amortization reports the year's decline in value of
intangibles. A 17-year patent, for example, would
be amortized over a PEriod of 17 years using the
straight-line method of amortization.
Selling, General and Administrative ExPEnses
Includes exPEnses such as sales agents' salaries and
commissions, advertising and promotion, travel and
entertainment, executives' salaries, office payroll,
and office exPEnses. This item is kept separate so
that analysts and investors can see the extent of
sales and administrative costs.

The Income Statement
OPErating Income
In the example, interest exPEnse comes from:
Determined by subtracting all oPErating exPEnses
from the gross margin, oPErating income is revenue
earned from oPErations. It does not include other
miscellaneous charges or exPEnses (e.g., equity
pickup in unconsolidated subsidiaries, extraordinary charges, restructuring charges and the like)
that are not part of the company's day-to-day
oPErations. The presentation of oPErating income
can vary from company to company.
Dividend and Interest Income
This additional source of revenue comes from
dividends and interest a company receives from its
equity investments.
Interest ExPEnse
The interest exPEnse paid on debt is sometimes
called a "fixed charge." It must be paid PEriodically
whether or not the company is profitable. Fixed
charges such as interest differ from stock dividends,
which are payable only if the board of directors
declares them. Interest exPEnse is a cost of
doing business.

Income Tax ExPEnse
Every company has an "effective tax rate" that
is based on the level and nature of its income.
Large corporations such as ABC are subject to the
top statutory income tax rate. Tax credits, tax-free
income and nondeductible exPEnses--better known
as PErmanent differences--have an impact on the
overall effective tax rate. Therefore, it is not
unusual for the effective tax rate to be less than
the statutory rate.
Income Before Extraordinary Loss
The amount by which all revenues exceed all
exPEnses for the year, not counting extraordinary
gains or losses as defined by GAAP.

Extraordinary Items, Net of Tax
Net Income

The sum of all income and costs, including extraordinary items, is known as "net income"--the
bottom line. If net income for the year is negative,
the company records a loss for the year.
Under usual conditions, ABC's income before
extraordinary losses would represent its actual
income figure for the year. In the example, however,
one of ABC's factories was destroyed by an earthquake--constituting an extraordinary item. The
income statement isolates such unusual and infrequent events, net of their tax effect. The earningsPEr-share impact of such events is also separated
from the earnings PEr share attributable to
"normal" oPErations.
notes:
Extraordinary Items NonoPErating items that are unusual and infrequent, and that are not exPEcted to recur.
page 26
Analyzing the Income Statement
As with the balance sheet, investors use certain ratios and calculations to analyze the income
statement. These comparisons provide detailed information about a company's oPErating
results. The oPErating margin, oPErating cost ratio and net profit ratio provide general
information about the company and help investors assess its future prosPEcts.
OPErating Margin
OPErating Cost Ratio
By comparing oPErating income to net sales,
investors determine the company's oPErating margin.
Changes in the oPErating margin from year to year
reflect a company's financial health. In the example,
ABC's oPErating margin for the current year was
13.8%. In other words, for each dollar of sales,
13.8 cents remained as a profit from oPErations.
This figure is significant when compared with the
prior year's oPErating margin of 10%, because it
shows that ABC's business didn't just grow, it
became more profitable. Changes in oPErating
margin not only show changes in profitability:
They also reflect changes in volume, product
line(s) or tyPEs of customers served.
OPErating margins can also be compared among
multiple companies in the same field. If a company's
oPErating margin is low compared with others, it is
an unhealthy sign. Conversely, a comparatively high
oPErating margin is a signal of financial health.

Analyzing the Income Statement
Interest Coverage
Earnings PEr Common Share
Financial leverage compares a company's longterm debt and preferred stock to its common equity.
A company with a large proportion of bonds and
preferred stock relative to common stock is said to
be "highly leveraged." High leverage can work for
or against a company, dePEnding on the earnings
available to the common shareholders. Generally
sPEaking, analysts consider highly leveraged
companies to be riskier, because moderate declines
in earnings can prove devastating for the common
shareholders and the company's ability to cover
interest on its bonds.
In the example, ABC is not a highly leveraged
company, making it more attractive to conservative
investors.
Preferred Dividend Coverage
Investors use net profit as the basis for calculating
preferred dividend coverage, because federal
income taxes and all interest charges must be paid
before anything is available for shareholders. In the
example, the total dividend requirement for ABC's
preferred stock is $350,000. Divide net income of
$47,750,000 by this figure and the answer is 136.4--
meaning that ABC has earned the preferred dividend
requirement more than 136 times. This ratio is a
comparatively high one because ABC has a relatively
small amount of preferred stock outstanding.
Investors are often more interested in a stock's earnings than in its dividends, because earnings usually
drive stock market prices. This discussion will focus
on net income PEr common share.
In the example, ABC's income statement shows
earnings PEr common share at $3.16. This can be
computed using the simple calculation shown.

More Complex Earnings Calculations
ABC Manufacturing's capital structure is very
simple, consisting of common and preferred stock,
so the simple calculation suffices to show earnings
PEr share. More complex capital structures require
more complex earnings calculations. Complex
Financial Leverage A comparison of a company's long-term debt to its capital structure. Leverage is also the
practice of obtaining capital using borrowed funds or preferred stock, rather than common stock.
Preferred Dividend Coverage The number of times the preferred dividend is covered (earned) by net income.
Convertible SECurity A debt or equity SECurity that may, under certain circumstances, be exchanged for or
converted into another SECurity, generally common stock. Examples include convertible preferred stock or
convertible bonds. Convertible SECurities are deemed to be only one step short of common stock; their value
stems in large part from the value of the common stock to which they relate.
Option The right to buy or sell a stock for a preset price (known as the "exercise price" or "strike price") during a
sPEcified PEriod of time.
page 28
Analyzing the Income Statement
capital structures typically contain convertible
SECurities, options, warrants or contingently
issuable shares. To address these complex capital
structures, companies are required to report two
different forms of earnings PEr share: basic earnings
and diluted earnings.
Basic Earnings PEr Common Share
Companies determine basic earnings by dividing the
earnings available to common shareholders for the
reporting PEriod by the number of common shares
outstanding during that PEriod. What is called the
"average calculation" is simply the arithmetic mean
of the average shares outstanding for the reporting
PEriod. The basic earnings PEr share equation does
not include unexercised stock options, convertible
SECurities and contingently issuable shares.
As seen in the example on page 28, ABC had $3.16
basic earnings PEr common share.
Diluted Earnings PEr Common Share
Companies determine diluted earnings PEr share by
dividing the adjusted earnings available to common
shareholders for the PEriod by the average number
of common and potential common shares outstanding, if such potential common shares are dilutive.
(Dilution occurs when earnings PEr share decreases
or loss PEr share increases.)
Adjustments to earnings can include:
(cid:1) Dividends on convertible preferred stock
(cid:1) After-tax interest on convertible debt
(cid:1) Effect of the change in earnings from other
exPEnses
An example of a change in earnings from "other
exPEnses" would be an increase in profit-sharing
exPEnse stemming from a reduction in interest
exPEnse upon conversion of convertible debt.
If diluted earnings PEr share assumes that the convertible debt is converted to common stock, the
company will no longer have interest exPEnse, and
net income will increase. If profit-sharing exPEnse is
a PErcentage of net income, profit-sharing exPEnse
will increase as net income rises.
Warrant A guarantee, usually evidenced by a certificate, of the right to buy a stock for a preset price during a
sPEcified PEriod of time.
Contingently Issuable Shares Shares of stock whose issuance dePEnds on the occurrence of certain events
(e.g., stock options).
Basic Earnings Income available to common shareholders for the PEriod, divided by the weighted-average number
of common shares outstanding for the PEriod.
Diluted Earnings The amount of current earnings or loss PEr share reflecting the maximum dilution, or negative
impact, assuming the issuance of all potentially dilutive common shares.
Potential Common Shares SECurities and contractual arrangements--such as options and warrants, convertible
SECurities or contingent stock arrangements--that may result in the issuance of common stock in the future.
page 29
Analyzing the Income Statement
Holders of convertible stock and bonds can
elect either:
(cid:1) A return on their investment at the sPEcified
dividend or interest rate, or
(cid:1) Conversion into common stock and participation
in market appreciation and dividends resulting
from increased earnings on the common stock.
Options and Warrants
Options and warrants are the most frequent forms
of potential common shares. The following example
discusses dilution from the assumed conversion
of options. The example uses the "Treasury Stock
Method," which assumes that all proceeds from the
conversion of in-the-money options go to repurchase
common shares at the PEriod's average market price.
SECurities need not be actually converted to common stock to be referred to as "potential common
shares." They are so called simply because in
certain circumstances they enable holders to cause
an increase in the number of common shares by
exercising, exchanging or converting.
Each issue of potential common shares is considered
separately and in sequence, from the most dilutive
(lowering earnings PEr share to the greatest extent)
to the least dilutive. This process stems from an
examination of the marginal earnings PEr share
impact and is known as antidilution sequencing.
To calculate diluted earnings PEr share, analysts
compare the impact of the most dilutive SECurity
to basic earnings PEr share. If a potential common
share is antidilutive--that is, if it raises earnings
PEr share--it is excluded from the diluted earnings
PEr share calculation. Excluding antidilutive shares
from the calculation means that diluted earnings
PEr share are always less than, or equal to, basic
earnings PEr share. In practice, they are usually less
than basic earnings, due to the dilutive effects of
potential common shares.
Suppose a company has $300,000 in net income
available to common shareholders and 100,000
common shares outstanding for the year. This
company would report basic earnings PEr share
of $3.00.
In the example, this company also has 10,000 stock
options outstanding with an average strike price
of $20 a share. The average share price for the
year was $50. The $200,000 in options proceeds is
assumed to repurchase 4,000 common shares at
$50 a share, reducing common shares by 4,000.
The net dilutive effect of the 10,000 options, then,
is an increase of 6,000 common shares (10,000
shares less the 4,000 repurchased). The options
have the effect of diluting earnings PEr share to
$2.83: $300,000 in net income divided by 106,000
common shares, including the net 6,000 options.
To examine the diluted earnings-PEr-share calculation further, suppose the same company also has 6%
convertible bonds with a par value of $1 million and
a conversion ratio of 20 common shares for every
$1,000 bond.
Antidilution Sequencing Examination of potential common shares by order of most dilutive to least dilutive.
In-the-Money Option An option is "in the money" when the current share price exceeds the strike price.
Strike Price A preset price at which investors have the right to buy or sell.
page 30
Analyzing the Income Statement
The example shows basic earnings PEr share of
$3.00. The effect of options lowered earnings PEr
share to $2.83.
Converting the 1,000 bonds into common shares
would yield another 20,000 shares. But converting
the bonds would save the company $60,000 in
interest payments, less the $24,000 tax deduction,
thus increasing net income available to common
shareholders by $36,000.
The company in the example would report both basic
earnings PEr share ($3.00) and diluted earnings PEr
share ($2.67). Most analysts and research treat
diluted earnings--reflecting the dilution for all potential common shares--as the more significant number.
Price-Earnings (P/E) Ratio
Many factors affect common stock's price and
return. One such factor is the relationship between
market price and the stock's earnings PEr share--
the price-earnings ratio.
If a stock is selling at $25 PEr share and earning
$2 PEr share annually, its P/E ratio is 12.5 to 1,
usually shortened to 12.5. The stock is selling at
12.5 times earnings. If the share price rose to $40,
the P/E ratio would be 20--the stock would be
selling at 20 times earnings. If the price dropPEd to
$12, the P/E ratio would be 6, or six times earnings.
In our example, ABC, with no potential common
shares, has net income PEr common share of $3.21.
A stock price of $33 yields a P/E ratio of 10.3. An
analyst would examine ABC's P/E ratio over a
PEriod of years, and would compare it with similar
stocks' P/E ratios.
ABC's P/E ratio of 10.3 means its stock is selling
at approximately 10.3 times earnings. Last year,
when ABC earned $2.77 PEr share, the same P/E
ratio would mean that its stock was selling for
$28.50. Investors who bought ABC then would
be satisfied now.
Generally, a company with a high P/E multiple compared with other companies in its PEer group is likely
to produce higher profits in future. Remember, though,
that the historical P/E multiple is a guide, not a guarantee. In reality, investors can never be certain that any
stock will keep the same P/E ratio from year to year.
notes:
Price-Earnings (P/E) Ratio The comparison of the market price of a share of stock to the earnings
PEr share of that stock.

The Statement of Changes in Shareholders' Equity
As noted, the statement shows that ABC
Manufacturing issued additional common stock
during the year. It also exPErienced a foreign
currency translation gain and an unrealized gain
on investments classified as available-for-sale.
Dividend Payout PErcentage
Find the dividend payout PErcentage--the PErcentage of earnings PEr share paid to shareholders--by
dividing dividend PEr common share by net income
PEr common share.
Retained earnings reflect the cumulative earnings
that the company has invested for future growth.
The statement of changes shows that ABC's retained
earnings increased by net income (see page 33) less
dividends on preferred and common stock.
Dividends
Dividends on common stock do not enter into the
determination of net income and are not deductible
for tax purposes.
Dividend PEr Share
ABC paid its common shareholders $18 million in
dividends this year. The balance sheet shows that
the company has 15 million shares outstanding.
Calculated by dividing common stock dividends
by the number of shares outstanding, the dividend
PEr share is an important item for some analysts
and investors.

Dividend Yield
Investors also look at the dividend yield, which is
an estimate, expressed as a PErcentage, of the return
PEr share on a given class of stock. The common
dividend yield indicates the PErcentage return that
the annual common dividend provides, based on
the market price of the common stock.
If a company pays a dividend, this means the
company has excess cash flow that can be used to
comPEnsate the shareholders for their investment.
However, investors should not make assumptions
about a company's financial health based solely
on whether or not the company pays a dividend.
ABC added $29,400,000 to its retained earnings
during the year after paying dividends totaling
$18,350,000. Even if ABC has some unprofitable
years in the future, it has plenty of retained earnings from which to keep paying dividends.

The Statement of Changes in Shareholders' Equity
A healthy stockpile of retained earnings gives a company a cushion against hard times, but they can also
spark a hostile takeover attempt. Another company
could buy enough of ABC's common shares to vote
out the current management and merge ABC into
itself. The acquiring company could get the money
to buy ABC's stock by issuing shares of its own
stock, then use ABC's retained earnings to pay the
dividends. This possibility makes it incumbent
upon ABC's management to ensure that its retained
earnings are put to work to increase the company's
total wealth. Otherwise, the shareholders might
cooPErate in the raid on ABC.
Return on Equity (ROE)
Return on equity shows how hard shareholders'
equity is working. ROE is a popular measure for
investors making individual judgments on how
much a certain stock is worth.
To compute ABC's ROE, look at the balance sheet
and compute the average common shareholders'
equity for the year to find how much ABC made
on it.
Return on Equity

Average stockholders' equity
of $325,825 less $6,000
preferred stock value
Return on Equity
/ $319,825
=
14.8%
This means that for every dollar of shareholders'
equity, ABC earned nearly 15 cents. In considering
how good a return this is--and, by extension,
whether to put money to work in ABC's stock--
investors must:
(cid:1) Compare ABC's 14.8% with ROE from ABC's
comPEtitors
(cid:1) Compare ABC's return with the potential return
from other investments; e.g., CDS, corporate
bonds, real estate or other common stocks.
Note that 14.8% is what ABC itself earns and by
no means reflects what investors will receive in
dividends on ABC's stock. What ROE really reveals is
whether ABC Manufacturing is a relatively attractive
investment. If so, investors can only hoPE that this
attractiveness will be reflected in ABC's share price.

The Statement of Cash Flows
The Statement of Cash Flows completes the picture of ABC Manufacturing's financial status.
Cash-flow analysis is a critical part of any investment decision. As with the income statement, a
single year's cash flow statement does not tell the complete story of a company's financial status.
Indeed, the historical record for a series of years is more useful than any single year's figures. For
the purposes of this example, however, only one year of ABC Manufacturing's cash flows is shown.

The Statement of Cash Flows
Cash Flows
Cash flows are related to net income, but are not
equivalent to it.
Investing activities
(cid:1) Activities related to asset acquisition
(cid:1) Activities related to asset disposal
This results from the accrual method of accounting.
Accrual accounting recognizes a transaction on the
income statement when the earnings process is
completed--i.e., when the goods or services have
been delivered or the exPEnses incurred. This does
not necessarily coincide with the time that cash is
exchanged. Cash from merchandise sales, for
example, is often received after the delivery of
merchandise to customers. Generally, however, sales
are recorded on the income statement when goods
are shipPEd or the service is PErformed and a related
receivable is recorded on the balance sheet.
OPErating activities are those activities not classified
as related to either financing or investing; they
involve the company's primary business activities
and reflect the cash effects of transactions, which
are included in the determination of net income.
Many items enter into the determination of net
income, so the "indirect method" is used to
determine the cash provided by, or used for,
oPErating activities. The indirect method requires
the adjustment of net income to reconcile it to
cash flows from oPErating activities.
Cash flows are also classified by business activities,
including:
Common examples of cash flows from oPErating
activities include:
Financing activities
(cid:1) Issuance of debt or equity SECurities
(cid:1) Repayment of debt
(cid:1) Distribution of dividends
notes:
(cid:1) Cash collected from customers
(cid:1) Interest received and paid
(cid:1) Dividends received
(cid:1) Salary
(cid:1) Insurance
(cid:1) Tax payments
Accrual Method of Accounting Method of accounting that recognizes revenue when earned and exPEnses
when incurred, in order to appropriately match income with exPEnses in an accounting PEriod.

Additional Disclosures and Audit Reports
Notes
Many PEople do not like to read the notes to an
annual report because they are complicated and are
rarely written in plain English. Yet the notes reveal
many critical asPEcts of a company's financial story.
For example, notes contain a number of important
and required disclosures. Bear in mind that the
financial statements themselves just report the
balances in the various accounts and do not contain
a complete or adequate discussion of those balances.
The information in the notes can highlight the
reasons the balances came out as they did.
Typically included in the notes are the following:
(cid:1) Description of the company's policies--for
depreciation, amortization, consolidation, foreign
currency translation, earnings PEr share, etc.
(cid:1) Inventory valuation method--indicates which
method is used to determine the cost of goods sold
on the income statement and on the balance sheet.
In addition to average cost, examples of valuation
methods include last-in, fIRSt-out (LIFO) and fIRStin, fIRSt-out (FIFO). LIFO means that the costs on
the income statement reflect the cost of inventories
produced or purchased most recently; FIFO reflects
the costs of the oldest inventories. This distinction
is extremely important: LIFO does not overstate
profits during inflationary times, while FIFO does.
(cid:1) Inventory composition--the composition of
the inventories by raw materials, work-in-process,
finished goods and supplies. Inventory composition
is usually not shown on the balance sheet.
(cid:1) Asset impairment--details about impaired assets
or assets to be disposed of.
(cid:1) Investments--information about debt and equity
SECurities classified as "trading," "available for sale"
or "held to maturity."
(cid:1) Income tax provisions--the breakdown by
current and deferred taxes and its composition into
federal, state, local and foreign tax, accompanied by
a reconciliation from the statutory income tax rate
to the effective tax rate for the company.
(cid:1) Changes in accounting policy--changes in
accounting policy due to new accounting rules.
(cid:1) Nonrecurring items--details of items such as
PEnsion-plan terminations or acquisitions/
dispositions of significant business units.
(cid:1) Employment and retirement programs--
details of employment contracts, profit-sharing,
PEnsion and retirement plans and other postretirement, postemployment benefits.
(cid:1) Stock options--details of stock options granted
to officers and employees.
(cid:1) Long-term leases--disclosure of lease obligations
on assets and facilities on a PEr-year basis for the
next several years, as well as total lease obligations
over the remaining lease PEriod.
Last-In, FIRSt-Out (LIFO) An inventory-costing method that states inventory at its earliest cost while charging
cost of sales at its latest cost (in the reverse order that the inventory was accumulated).
FIRSt-In, FIRSt-Out (FIFO) An inventory-costing method that states inventory at its current cost while charging
cost of sales in the order that the inventory was accumulated.
page 38
Additional Disclosures and Audit Reports
(cid:1) Long-term debt--details regarding the issuance
and maturities of long-term debt.
(cid:1) Contingent liabilities--disclosures relating to
potential or PEnding claims or lawsuits that might
affect the company.
(cid:1) Future contractual commitments--terms of
contracts in force that will affect future PEriods.
(cid:1) Regulations/restrictions--description of regulatory requirements and dividend or other restrictions.
(cid:1) Off-balance-sheet credit and market risks--
the risks associated with certain investments,
including interest rate swaps, forward and futures
contracts, and options contracts. "Off-balance-sheet
risk" is defined as the potential for loss over and
above the amount recorded on the balance sheet.
(cid:1) Fair value of financial instruments carried
at cost--discloses fair market values of instruments
such as long-term debt and off-balance-sheet instruments (e.g., swaps and options), carried at cost.
(cid:1) Segment sales, oPErating profits and
identifiable assets--information on each industry
segment accounting for more than 10% of the
company's sales, oPErating profits and/or assets.
Multinational companies also show sales and
identifiable assets for each geographical area
where sales or assets exceed 10% of the related
consolidated amounts.
IndePEndent Audits
Printed in the annual report and often referred
to as the auditors' opinion, the report from the
company's indePEndent auditors states that:
(cid:1) The audit stEPS taken to veriFY the financial
statements meet the auditing profession's
approved standards of practice.
(cid:1) The financial statements prepared by management
are management's responsibility and follow GAAP.
(cid:1) There is no material misstatement.
An unqualified, or "clean," opinion from the indePEndent auditors provides added assurance that the
figures are reliable and fairly presented. By contrast,
if the auditors' report contains the qualiFYing words
"except for," the reader should investigate the
reason(s) behind the qualification(s), which
should be summarily explained in that report
and referenced in the notes.
In cases where the auditors do not qualiFY the
opinion, a separate paragraph may be inserted to
emphasize a particular item. Investors and analysts
should carefully scrutinize any such matters.
page 39
The Long View
Investors and analysts must compare company
reports--to other dates and time PEriods, reports
of other companies, industry averages, even bROAd
economic factors--to derive any useful information
from them. But most of all, a company's annual
activities can be effectively compared with the
same firm's results from other years.
At one time, investors and analysts made this comparison by keeping files of old annual reports. Many
of today's annual reports, however, include a multiyear summary of the company's financial highlights.
A multiyear summary can show the reader:
(cid:1) Revenue consistency and trends
(cid:1) Earnings trends, particularly in relation to sales
(cid:1) Net earnings trends as a PErcentage of sales
(cid:1) ROE trends
(cid:1) Net earnings PEr common share
(cid:1) Dividends and dividend trends
This provides the investing public with information
about the company's PErformance over an extended
PEriod. Although the summary is not a part of the
statement verified by the auditors, it is there for
investors to read. The summary provides key
information to help investors predict how a
company and its stock will PErform in the future.
Other items sometimes included in the financial
summary include:
(cid:1) Changes in net worth
(cid:1) Book value PEr share
(cid:1) Capital exPEnditures for plant and machinery
(cid:1) Long-term debt
(cid:1) Capital stock changes due to stock dividends
and splits
(cid:1) Number of employees
(cid:1) Number of shareholders
(cid:1) Number of outlets
The summary may also include information on
foreign subsidiaries and the extent to which foreign
oPErations have been embodied in the company's
financial report.
