 General 
Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) have approximately 134,500 employees worldwide
engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the
health care field. Johnson & Johnson is a holding company, with operating companies conducting
business in virtually all countries of the world. The Company’s primary focus is products related to
human health and well-being. Johnson & Johnson was incorporated in the State of New Jersey in 1887.
The Executive Committee of Johnson & Johnson is the principal management group responsible for the
strategic operations and allocation of the resources of the Company. This Committee oversees and
coordinates the activities of the Company's three business segments: Consumer Health (previously
referred to as Consumer), Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices. Within the strategic parameters
provided by the Committee, senior management groups at U.S. and international operating companies are
each responsible for their own strategic plans and the day-to-day operations of those companies. Each
subsidiary within the business segments is, with limited exceptions, managed by residents of the
country where located.
 Segments of Business 
The Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer Health, Pharmaceutical and Medical
Devices. Additional information required by this item is incorporated herein by reference to the
narrative and tabular descriptions of segments and operating results under: “Item 7. Management’s

and laser refractive surgery. These products are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers,
and used predominantly in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care
professionals and clinics.
 Geographic Areas 
Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) have approximately 134,500 employees worldwide
engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the
health care field. The Company conducts business in virtually all countries of the world with the
primary focus on products related to human health and well-being.
The products made and sold in the international business include many of those described above under
“– Segments of Business – Consumer Health,” “– Pharmaceutical” and “– Medical Devices.” However, the
principal markets, products and methods of distribution in the international business vary with the
country and the culture. The products sold in international business include those developed in the
U.S. and by subsidiaries abroad.
Investments and activities in some countries outside the U.S. are subject to higher risks than
comparable U.S. activities because the investment and commercial climate may be influenced by
financial instability in international economies, restrictive economic policies and political and
legal system uncertainties.
 Raw Materials 
Raw materials essential to the Company's business are generally readily available from multiple
sources. Where there are exceptions, the temporary unavailability of those raw materials would not
likely have a material adverse effect on the financial results of the Company.
 Patents 
The Company's subsidiaries have made a practice of obtaining patent protection on their products and
processes where possible. They own, or are licensed under, a significant number of patents in the
U.S. and other countries relating to their products, product uses, formulations and manufacturing
processes, which in the aggregate are believed to be of material importance to the Company in the
operation of its businesses. The Company’s subsidiaries face patent challenges from third parties,
including challenges seeking to manufacture and market generic and biosimilar versions of the
Company's key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those
products. Significant legal proceedings and claims involving the Company's patent and other
intellectual property are described in Note 19, “Legal Proceedings— Intellectual Property” of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.
 2 
Sales of the Company’s largest product, STELARA ® (ustekinumab), accounted for approximately 9.3% of
the Company's total revenues for fiscal 2020. Accordingly, the patents related to this product are
believed to be material to the Company. Janssen Biotech, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Johnson &
Johnson, owns patents specifically related to STELARA ®. The latest expiring United States patent
expires in 2023. The latest expiring European patent expires in 2024.
Sales of the Company’s second largest product, DARZALEX ® (daratumumab) and DARZALEX FASPRO™
(daratumumab and hyaluronidase-fihj), accounted for approximately 5.1% of the Company's total
revenues for fiscal 2020.
Accordingly, the patents related to this product are believed to be material to the Company. Genmab
A/S owns patents related to DARZALEX ® , and Janssen Biotech, Inc. has an exclusive license to those
patents. The latest expiring licensed United States patent expires in 2029. The latest expiring
licensed European patent expires in 2031. Janssen Biotech, Inc. owns a separate patent portfolio
related to DARZALEX FASPRO™.
Sales of the Company’s third largest product, IMBRUVICA ® (ibrutinib), accounted for approximately
5.0% of the Company's total revenues for fiscal 2020. Accordingly, patents related to this product
are believed to be material to the Company. Pharmacyclics LLC (an AbbVie company) owns the patents
related to IMBRUVICA ® , and Janssen Biotech, Inc. has an exclusive license to those patents. The
Pharmacyclics patents and their expiration dates are listed in the Approved Drug Products with
Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (Orange Book). Pharmacyclics LLC and Janssen Biotech, Inc. have
entered into confidential settlement agreements with certain generic companies granting licenses to
market their generic ibrutinib products in the United States before the expiration of certain
patents.
 Trademarks 
The Company’s subsidiaries have made a practice of selling their products under trademarks and of
obtaining protection for these trademarks by all available means. These trademarks are protected by
registration in the U.S. and other countries where such products are marketed. The Company considers
these trademarks in the aggregate to be of material importance in the operation of its businesses.
 Seasonality 
Worldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality; however, spending has been
heavier in the fourth quarter of each year than in other quarters. This reflects increased spending
decisions, principally for advertising and research and development activity.
 Competition 
In all of their product lines, the Company's subsidiaries compete with companies both locally and
globally. Competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the
competing companies involved. Competition in research, both internally and externally sourced,
involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes, is
particularly significant. The development of new and innovative products, as well as protecting the
underlying intellectual property of the Company’s product portfolio, is important to the Company's
success in all areas of its business. The competitive environment requires substantial investments in
continuing research. In addition, the development and maintenance of customer demand for the
Company’s consumer products involve significant expenditures for advertising and promotion.
 Environment 
The Company is subject to a variety of U.S. and international environmental protection measures. The
Company believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental
laws and regulations. The Company’s compliance with these requirements did not change during the past
year, and is not expected to have a material effect upon its capital expenditures, cash flows,
earnings or competitive position.
 Regulation 
The Company’s businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries
in which operations are conducted, and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation
and enforcement. The Company is subject to costly and complex U.S. and foreign laws and governmental
regulations and any adverse regulatory action may materially adversely affect the Company's financial
condition and business operations. In the U.S., the drug, device and cosmetic industries have long
been subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies, primarily as to product safety,
efficacy, manufacturing, advertising, labeling and safety reporting. The exercise of broad regulatory
powers by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the U.S. FDA) continues to result in increases in
the amounts of testing and documentation required for U.S. FDA approval of new drugs and devices and
a corresponding increase in the expense of product introduction. Similar trends are also evident in
major markets outside of the U.S. The new medical device regulatory framework and the new privacy
regulations in Europe and in other countries are examples of such increased regulation.
 3 
The regulatory agencies under whose purview the Company operates have administrative powers that may
subject it to actions such as product withdrawals, recalls, seizure of products and other civil and
criminal sanctions. In some cases, the Company’s subsidiaries may deem it advisable to initiate
product recalls.
The U.S. FDA and regulatory agencies around the globe are also increasing their enforcement
activities. If the U.S. FDA were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or
regulations, or that any of our drugs or medical devices are ineffective or pose an unreasonable
health risk, the U.S. FDA could ban such products, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded
products, order a recall, repair, replacement, or refund of such products, refuse to grant pending
applications for marketing authorization or require certificates of foreign governments for exports,
and/or require us to notify health professionals and others that the products present unreasonable
risks of substantial harm to the public health. The U.S. FDA may also assess civil or criminal
penalties against us, our officers or employees and impose operating restrictions on a company-wide
basis, or enjoin and/or restrain certain conduct resulting in violations of applicable law. The U.S.
FDA may also recommend prosecution to the US Department of Justice. Any adverse regulatory action,
depending on its magnitude, may restrict us from effectively marketing and selling our products and
limit our ability to obtain future clearances or approvals, and could result in a substantial
modification to our business practices and operations. Equivalent enforcement mechanisms exist in
different countries in which we conduct business.
The costs of human health care have been and continue to be a subject of study, investigation and
regulation by governmental agencies and legislative bodies around the world. In the U.S., attention
has been focused by states, regulatory agencies and congress on drug prices and profits and programs
that encourage doctors to write prescriptions for particular drugs, or to recommend, use or purchase
particular medical devices. Laws and regulations have been enacted to require adherence to strict
compliance standards and prevent fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. There is increased focus
on interactions and financial relationships between healthcare companies and health care providers.
Various transparency laws and regulations require disclosures of payments and other transfers of
value made to physicians and teaching hospitals and, beginning with disclosures in 2022, to certain
non-physician practitioners. Federal and foreign laws governing international business practices
require strict compliance with anti-bribery standards and certain prohibitions with respect to
payments to any foreign government official. Payers have become a more potent force in the market
place and increased attention is being paid to drug and medical device pricing, appropriate drug and
medical device utilization and the quality and costs of health care generally.
U.S. government agencies continue efforts to repeal, modify, or invalidate provisions of the Patient
Protection and Affordable Care Act (the ACA) which passed in 2010. For example, federal legislation
repealed the ACA’s individual mandate tax penalty as well as the tax on generous employer-sponsored
healthcare plans; the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) began permitting states to impose
work requirements on persons covered by Medicaid expansion plans; certain federal subsidies to
insurers have ended; and certain short-term insurance plans not offering the full array of ACA
benefits have been allowed to extend in duration. Some of these changes are being challenged in U.S.
courts and so their long-term impact remains uncertain. The ACA has also been subject to judicial
challenge. In November 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court heard argument in Texas v. Azar , which
challenges the constitutionality of the ACA. Pending resolution of the litigation, all of the ACA but
the individual mandate to buy health insurance remains in effect. The U.S. government also continues
to propose and implement changes to the Medicare Part D benefit including the size of manufacturer
discounts in the coverage gap and catastrophic phases of the benefit. There are a number of
additional bills pending in Congress and healthcare reform proposals at the state level that would
affect drug pricing in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This changing federal landscape has both
positive and negative impacts on the U.S. healthcare industry with much remaining uncertain as to how
various provisions of federal law, and potential modification or repeal of these laws, will
ultimately affect the industry.
In addition, business practices in the health care industry have come under increased scrutiny,
particularly in the U.S., by government agencies and state attorneys general, and resulting
investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties.
Further, the Company relies on global supply chains, and production and distribution processes, that
are complex, are subject to increasing regulatory requirements, and may be faced with unexpected
changes such as those resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and Brexit, that may affect sourcing,
supply and pricing of materials used in the Company's products. These processes also are subject to
complex and lengthy regulatory approvals.
The global regulatory landscape is also subject to change as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to
affect the U.S. and global economies. The U.S. FDA and other health authorities have shifted
resources and priorities to meet the many challenges presented by the pandemic. Pandemic-related
disruptions could negatively impact the processing of regulatory submissions and slow agency review
times necessary for the approval or clearance of new drugs and devices. The duration and severity of
the COVID-19 pandemic is unpredictable and difficult to assess.

 Employees and Human Capital Management 
As of January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019, the number of employees were approximately:
 2020 2019 
 Employees1 136,400 133,200 
 Full-time equivalent (FTE) positions2 134,500 132,200 
1 “Employee” is defined as an individual working full-time or part-time, excluding fixed term
employees, interns and co-op employees. Employee data may not include full population from more
recently acquired companies and individuals on long-term disability are excluded. Contingent workers,
contractors and subcontractors are also excluded.
2 FTE represents the total number of full-time equivalent positions and does not reflect the total
number of individual employees as some work part-time.
 Strategy 
The Company believes that its employees are critical to its continued success and are an essential
element of its long-term strategy. Management is responsible for ensuring that its policies and
processes reflect and reinforce the Company's desired corporate culture, including policies and
processes related to strategy, risk management, and ethics and compliance. The Company’s human
capital management strategy is built on three fundamental focus areas:
• Attracting and recruiting the best talent
• Developing and retaining talent
• Empowering and inspiring talent
Underpinning these focus areas are ongoing efforts to cultivate and foster a culture built on
diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), innovation, health, well-being and safety, where the Company's
employees are encouraged to succeed both professionally and personally while helping the Company
achieve its business goals.
 Culture and Employee Engagement 
At Johnson & Johnson, employees are guided by Our Credo which sets forth the Company's
responsibilities to patients, consumers, customers, healthcare professionals, employees, communities
and shareholders. Employees worldwide are further guided by the Company’s Code of Business Conduct
which sets basic requirements for business conduct and serves as a foundation for the Company
policies, procedures and guidelines, all of which provide additional guidance on expected employee
behaviors in every market where it operates. The Company c onducts global surveys that offer its
employees the ability to provide feedback and valuable insight to help address potential human
resources risks and identify opportunities to improve. In 2020, 93% of global employees across 78
countries participated in Our Credo Survey which is offered in 36 languages.
 Growth and Development 
To continue to lead in the changing healthcare landscape, it is crucial that the Company continue to
attract and retain top talent. The Company believes that its employees must be equipped with the
right knowledge and skills and be provided with opportunities to grow and develop in their careers.
Accordingly, professional development programs and educational resources
 5 
are available to all employees. The Company's objective is to foster a learning culture that helps
shape each person’s unique career path while creating a robust pipeline of talent to deliver on the
Company’s long-term strategies. In furtherance of this objective, the Company deploys a global
approach to ensure development is for everyone, regardless of where they are on their career journey.
In 2020, 44.6% of employees in Manager and above job categories took advantage of career
opportunities by moving across functions, country or business segment lines (including upward
promotion or lateral transfer and excluding employees in the research and development organizations).
The Company's voluntary turnover rate was 5.2%.
 Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) 
The Company is committed to workplace diversity and to cultivating, fostering, and advancing a
culture of equity and inclusion. Enabling employees to perform at their best while being themselves
is fundamental to the Company's continued success. The Company’s DEI vision is: Be yourself, change
the world . The Company's DEI strategy focuses on three pillars that reflect the strategic priorities
identified to enable the Company to address the challenges and opportunities presented by this
evolving understanding of diversity:
• Accelerate the Company’s efforts to advance a culture of inclusion and innovation
• Build a diverse workforce for the future
• Enhance business results and reputation
The Company's DEI strategy is guided by internal and external insights, global best practices and
continual employee feedback which remind the Company that while diversity changes by location,
inclusion is the same everywhere.
 Compensation and Benefits 
As part of the Company's total rewards philosophy, the Company offers competitive compensation and
benefits to attract and retain top talent. The Company is committed to fairness and equitable
treatment in its compensation and benefits for employees at all levels. The Company observes legal
minimum wage provisions and exceeds them where possible. The Company's total rewards offerings
include an array of programs to support its employees' financial, physical, and mental well-being,
including annual performance incentive opportunities, pension and retirement savings programs, health
and welfare benefits, paid time off, leave programs, flexible work schedules and employee assistance
programs.
 Health, Wellness and Safety 
The Company’s investment in employee health, well-being and safety is built on its conviction that
advancing health for humanity starts with advancing the health of its employees. With the right
awareness, focus, practices and tools, the Company ensures that all its employees around the world,
as well as temporary contractors and visitors to the Company's sites, can work safely. The Company
has continuously expanded health and well-being programs throughout the Company and across the globe,
incorporating new thinking and technologies to keep its offerings best-in-class and to help employees
achieve their personal mind and body health goals. The programs and practices the Company advances
covers three core dimensions: Healthy Eating, Healthy Movement and Healthy Mind.

│ Item 1A. RISK FACTORS │
An investment in the Company’s common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties. The
Company seeks to identify, manage and mitigate risks to our business, but uncertainties and risks are
difficult to predict and many are outside of the Company's control and cannot therefore be
eliminated. In addition to the other information in this report and the Company’s other filings with
the SEC, investors should consider carefully the factors set forth below. Investors should be aware
that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and that the following is not meant
to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties. If known or unknown risks or
uncertainties materialize, the Company’s business, results of operations or financial condition could
be adversely affected, potentially in a material way.
Risks Related to Our Business, Industry and Operations
The Company’s businesses operate in highly competitive product markets and competitive pressures
could adversely affect the Company’s earnings.
The Company faces substantial competition in all three operating segments and in all geographic
markets. The Company’s businesses compete with companies of all sizes on the basis of cost-
effectiveness, technological innovations, intellectual property rights, product performance, real or
perceived product advantages, pricing and availability and rate of reimbursement. The Company also
competes with other market participants in securing rights to acquisitions, collaborations and
licensing agreements with third parties. Competition for rights to product candidates and
technologies may result in significant investment and acquisition costs and onerous agreement terms
for the Company. Competitors’ development of more effective or less costly products, and/or their
ability to secure patent and other intellectual property rights and successfully market products
ahead of the Company, could negatively impact sales of the Company’s existing products as well as its
ability to bring new products to market despite significant prior investment in the related product
development.
For the Company’s pharmaceutical businesses, loss of patent exclusivity for a product often is
followed by a substantial reduction in sales as competitors gain regulatory approval for generic and
other competing products and enter the market. Similar competition can be triggered by the loss of
exclusivity for a biological product. For the Company’s medical device businesses, technological
innovation, product quality, reputation and customer service are especially important to
competitiveness. Development by other companies of new or improved products, processes and
technologies could threaten to make the Company’s products or technologies less desirable, less
economical or obsolete. The Company’s consumer health businesses face intense competition from other
branded products and retailers’ private-label brands. If the Company fails to sufficiently
differentiate and market its brand name consumer products, this could adversely affect revenues and
profitability of those products.
Interruptions and delays in manufacturing operations could adversely affect the Company’s business,
sales and reputation.
The Company’s manufacture of products requires the timely delivery of sufficient amounts of complex,
high-quality components and materials. The Company's subsidiaries operate 90 manufacturing facilities
as well as sourcing from hundreds of suppliers around the world. The Company has in the past, and may
in the future, face unanticipated interruptions and delays in manufacturing through its internal or
external supply chain. Manufacturing disruptions can occur for many reasons including regulatory
action, production quality deviations or safety issues, labor disputes, site-specific incidents (such
as fires), natural disasters such as hurricanes and other severe weather events, raw material
shortages, political unrest, terrorist attacks and epidemics or pandemics. Such delays and
difficulties in manufacturing can result in product shortages, declines in sales and reputational
impact as well as significant remediation and related costs associated with addressing the shortage.
The Company relies on third parties to manufacture certain of our products. Any failure by or loss of
a third-party manufacturer could result in delays and increased costs, which may adversely affect our
business.
The Company relies on third parties to manufacture certain of our products. We depend on these third
party manufacturers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet
our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and to
deliver those products to us on a timely basis and at acceptable prices. However, we cannot guarantee
that these third-party manufacturers will be able to meet our near-term or long-term manufacturing
requirements, which could result in lost sales and have an adverse effect on our business.
Other risks associated with our reliance on third parties, including the Company’s strategic
partnership with Jabil in the Medical Devices segment, to manufacture these products include reliance
on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance, misappropriation of the Company’s
intellectual property, limited ability to manage our inventory, possible breach of the manufacturing
agreement by the third party and the possible termination or nonrenewal of the manufacturing
agreement by the third party at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us. Moreover, if any of our
third party manufacturers suffer any damage to facilities, lose benefits under material agreements,
experience power outages, encounter financial difficulties, are unable to secure necessary raw
materials from their suppliers or suffer any other reduction in efficiency, the Company may
 7 
experience significant business disruption. In the event of any such disruption, the Company would
need to seek and source other qualified third-party manufacturers, likely resulting in further delays
and increased costs which could affect our business adversely.
Counterfeit versions of our products could harm our patients and have a negative impact on our
revenues, earnings, reputation and business.
Our industry continues to be challenged by the vulnerability of distribution channels to illegal
counterfeiting and the presence of counterfeit products in a growing number of markets and over the
Internet. Third parties may illegally distribute and sell counterfeit versions of our products, which
do not meet our rigorous manufacturing and testing standards. To distributors and patients,
counterfeit products may be visually indistinguishable from the authentic version. Counterfeit
medicines pose a risk to patient health and safety because of the conditions under which they are
manufactured – often in unregulated, unlicensed, uninspected and unsanitary sites – as well as the
lack of regulation of their contents.
The industry's failure to mitigate the threat of counterfeit medicines could adversely impact our
business and reputation by impacting patient confidence in our authentic products, potentially
resulting in lost sales, product recalls, and an increased threat of litigation. In addition,
diversion of our products from their authorized market into other channels may result in reduced
revenues and negatively affect our profitability.
The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted certain aspects of the Company’s business and could
cause disruptions or future impact to the Company’s business, results of operations and financial
condition.
We are subject to risks associated with global health crises and pandemics, including the global
outbreak of the novel coronavirus and its mutations (COVID-19). The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely
impacted, and is expected to continue to adversely impact, certain aspects of the Company’s business,
results of operations and financial condition, including lower sales and reduced customer demand and
usage of certain of our products. The spread of COVID-19 has caused the Company to modify its
business practices (including instituting remote work for many of the Company's employees), and the
Company may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or as the Company
determines are in the best interests of our patients, customers, employees and business partners. The
Company continues to monitor the situation and while we have robust business continuity plans in
place across our global supply chain network to help mitigate the impact of COVID-19, these efforts
may not completely prevent our business from being adversely affected and future impacts remain
uncertain.
While the U.S. and other countries have begun or will begin to reopen their economies, the extent to
which COVID-19 will impact the Company's future operations will depend on many factors which cannot
be predicted with confidence, including the duration of the outbreak . Any resurgence in COVID-19
infections could result in the imposition of new mandates and prolonged restrictive measures
implemented in order to control the spread of the disease. The continued global spread of COVID-19
could adversely impact the Company's operations, including, among other things, our manufacturing
operations, supply chain, including third-party suppliers, sales and marketing and clinical trial
operations. Any of these factors could adversely affect the Company's business, financial results,
and global economic conditions generally.
We also face uncertainties related to our efforts to develop a COVID-19 vaccine candidate, including
uncertainties related to the risk that our development programs may not be successful, commercially
viable or receive approval or Emergency Use Authorization from regulatory authorities; risks
associated with clinical trial data, including further analyses of existing preclinical or clinical
trial data that may be inconsistent with the data used for selection of the JNJ-78436735 vaccine
candidate and dose level for the Phase 3 (ENSEMBLE) trial; the risk that clinical trial data are
subject to differing interpretations and assessments, including during the peer review/publication
process, in the scientific community generally, and by regulatory authorities; disruptions in the
relationships between us, our third-party suppliers and external manufacturers; the risk that other
companies may produce superior or competitive products; the risk that demand for any products we may
develop may no longer exist; risks related to the availability of raw materials to manufacture any
such products; the risk that we may not be able to recoup costs associated with our R&D and
manufacturing efforts and risks associated with any changes in the way we approach or provide
additional research funding for potential drug development related to COVID-19; the risk that we may
not be able to create or scale up manufacturing capacity on a timely basis, that we may experience
manufacturing delays once a manufacturing site is activated, or have access to logistics or supply
channels commensurate with global demand for any potential approved vaccine or product candidate,
which would negatively impact our ability to supply the estimated numbers of doses of our vaccine
candidate within the projected time periods indicated, and other challenges and risks associated with
the pace of our vaccine development program; and pricing and access challenges for such products,
including in the U.S.
In addition, to the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial
results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this "Risk
Factors" section and those incorporated by reference herein, i ncluding risks relating to the
Company’s effective tax rate as a result of changes in consumption as well as changes in
 8 
laws relating to supply of the Company’s products . Given that developments concerning the COVID-19
pandemic have been constantly evolving, additional impacts and risks may arise, including litigation,
that are not presently known to the Company.
Risk Related to the Government Regulation and Legal Proceedings
Global sales in the Company’s pharmaceutical and medical devices segments may be negatively impacted
by healthcare reforms and increasing pricing pressures.
Sales of the Company’s pharmaceutical and medical device products are significantly affected by
reimbursements by third-party payers such as government healthcare programs, private insurance plans
and managed care organizations. As part of various efforts to contain healthcare costs, these payers
are putting downward pressure on prices at which products will be reimbursed. In the U.S., increased
purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of Medicare, Medicaid, and private sector
beneficiaries, in part due to continued consolidation among health care providers, could result in
further pricing pressures. In addition, increased political scrutiny could result in additional
pricing pressures. Outside the U.S., numerous major markets, including the EU, United Kingdom and
Japan, have pervasive government involvement in funding healthcare and, in that regard, directly or
indirectly impose price controls, limit access to, or reimbursement for, the Company’s products, or
reduce the value of its intellectual property protection.
The Company is subject to significant legal proceedings that can result in significant expenses,
fines and reputational damage.
In the ordinary course of business, Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous
claims and lawsuits involving various issues such as patent disputes, product liability and claims
that their product sales, marketing and pricing practices violate various antitrust, unfair trade
practices and/or consumer protection laws. The Company's more significant legal proceedings are
described in Note 19, “Legal Proceedings” under Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
included in Item 8 of this Report. Litigation, in general, and securities, derivative action, class
action and multi-district litigation, in particular, can be expensive and disruptive. Some of these
matters may include thousands of plaintiffs, may involve parties seeking large and/or indeterminate
amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages, and may remain unresolved for several years. For
example, the Company is a defendant in numerous lawsuits arising out of the use of body powders
containing talc, primarily JOHNSONS ® Baby Powder, and the Company’s sale, manufacturing and
marketing of opioids. While the Company believes it has substantial defenses in these matters, it is
not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome of litigation. The Company could in the future be
required to pay significant amounts as a result of settlements or judgments in these matters,
potentially in excess of accruals, including matters where the Company could be held jointly and
severally liable among other defendants. The resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more
of these matters in any reporting period could have a material adverse effect on the Company's
results of operations and cash flows for that period. The Company does not purchase third-party
product liability insurance; however the Company utilizes a wholly-owned captive insurance company
subject to certain limits.
Product reliability, safety and effectiveness concerns can have significant negative impacts on sales
and results of operations, lead to litigation and cause reputational damage.
Concerns about product safety, whether raised internally or by litigants, regulators or consumer
advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence, can result in safety alerts, product
recalls, governmental investigations, regulatory action on the part of the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (or its counterpart in other countries), private claims and lawsuits, payment of fines
and settlements, declining sales and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in
damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in the Company’s products. Product recalls
have in the past, and could in the future, prompt government investigations and inspections, the
shutdown of manufacturing facilities, continued product shortages and related sales declines,
significant remediation costs, reputational damage, possible civil penalties and criminal
prosecution.
The Company faces significant regulatory scrutiny which imposes significant compliance costs and
exposes the Company to government investigations, legal actions and penalties.
Like other companies in the healthcare industry, the Company is subject to extensive regulation,
investigations and legal action, by national, state and local government agencies in the U.S. and
other countries in which they operate. Regulatory issues regarding compliance with current Good
Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) (and comparable quality regulations in foreign countries) by
manufacturers of drugs, devices and consumer products can lead to fines and penalties, product
recalls, product shortages, interruptions in production, delays in new product approvals and
litigation. In addition, the marketing, pricing and sale of the Company’s products are subject to
regulation, investigations and legal actions including under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act, the Medicaid Rebate Program, federal and state false claims acts, state unfair trade practices
acts and consumer protection laws. Scrutiny of health care industry business practices by government
agencies and state attorneys general in the U.S., and any resulting investigations and prosecutions,
carry risk of significant civil and criminal penalties including, but not limited to, debarment from
participation in government healthcare programs. Any such debarment could have a material adverse
effect on the Company’s business and results of operations. The most significant current
investigations and
 9 
litigation brought by government agencies are described in Note 19, “Legal Proceedings-Government
Proceedings” under Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.
Changes in tax laws or exposures to additional tax liabilities could negatively impact the Company’s
operating results.
Changes in tax laws or regulations around the world could negatively impact the Company’s effective
tax rate and results of operations. A change in statutory tax rate in any country would result in the
revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular
jurisdiction in the period in which the new tax law is enacted. This change would result in an
expense or benefit recorded to the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The Company closely
monitors these proposals as they arise in the countries where it operates. Changes to the statutory
tax rate may occur at any time, and any related expense or benefit recorded may be material to the
fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted.
See Note 8 on income taxes for additional information.
The Company conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and is addressing tax
audits and disputes with many tax authorities. In connection with the 2015 Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project, companies are required
to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to
greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in other countries. The Company regularly assesses the
likely outcomes of its tax audits and disputes to determine the appropriateness of its tax reserves.
However, any tax authority could take a position on tax treatment that is contrary to the Company’s
expectations, which could result in tax liabilities in excess of reserves.
 Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property 
The Company may not be able to successfully secure and defend intellectual property rights essential
to the Company’s businesses.
The Company owns or licenses a significant number of patents and other proprietary rights, relating
to its products and manufacturing processes. These rights are essential to the Company’s businesses
and materially important to the Company’s results of operations. Public policy, both within and
outside the U.S., has become increasingly unfavorable toward intellectual property rights. The
Company cannot be certain that it will obtain adequate patent protection for new products and
technologies in the United States and other important markets or that such protections, once granted,
will last as long as originally anticipated.
Competitors routinely challenge the validity or extent of the Company’s owned or licensed patents and
proprietary rights through litigation, interferences, oppositions and other proceedings, such as
inter partes review (IPR) proceedings before the United States Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO).
These proceedings absorb resources and can be protracted as well as unpredictable. In addition,
challenges that the Company’s products infringe the patents of third parties could result in the need
to pay past damages and future royalties and adversely affect the competitive position and sales of
the products in question.
The Company has faced increasing patent challenges from third parties seeking to manufacture and
market generic and biosimilar versions of the Company's key pharmaceutical products prior to
expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. In the U.S., manufacturers of generic
versions of innovative human pharmaceutical products may challenge the validity, or claim non-
infringement, of innovator products through the Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, process
with the FDA and related ANDA litigation. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA),
enacted in 2010, which created a new regulatory pathway for the approval by the FDA of biosimilar
alternatives to innovator-developed biological products, also created mechanisms for biosimilar
applicants to challenge the patents on the innovator biologics. The IPR process with the USPTO is
also being used by competitors to challenge patents asserted in litigation.
In the event the Company is not successful in defending its patents against such challenges, or upon
the “at-risk” launch (despite pending patent infringement litigation) by the generic or biosimilar
firm of its product, the Company can lose a major portion of revenues for the referenced product in a
very short period of time. Current legal proceedings involving the Company’s patents and other
intellectual property rights are described in Note 19, “Legal Proceedings—Intellectual Property” of
the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.
Risks Related to Product Development, Regulatory Approval and Commercialization
Significant challenges or delays in the Company’s innovation and development of new products,
technologies and indications could have an adverse impact on the Company’s long-term success.
 10 
The Company’s continued growth and success depends on its ability to innovate and develop new and
differentiated products and services that address the evolving health care needs of patients,
providers and consumers. Development of successful products and technologies is also necessary to
offset revenue losses when the Company’s existing products lose market share due to various factors
such as competition and loss of patent exclusivity. New products introduced within the past five
years accounted for approximately 25% of 2020 sales. The Company cannot be certain when or whether it
will be able to develop, license or otherwise acquire companies, products and technologies, whether
particular product candidates will be granted regulatory approval, and, if approved, whether the
products will be commercially successful.
The Company pursues product development through internal research and development as well as through
collaborations, acquisitions, joint ventures and licensing or other arrangements with third parties.
In all of these contexts, developing new products, particularly pharmaceutical and biotechnology
products and medical devices, requires significant investment of resources over many years. Only a
very few biopharmaceutical research and development programs result in commercially viable products.
The process depends on many factors including the ability to discern patients’ and health care
providers’ future needs; develop promising new compounds, strategies and technologies; achieve
successful clinical trial results; secure effective intellectual property protection; obtain
regulatory approvals on a timely basis; and, if and when they reach the market, successfully
differentiate the Company’s products from competing products and approaches to treatment. New
products or enhancements to existing products may not be accepted quickly or significantly in the
marketplace due to product and price competition, changes in customer preferences or healthcare
purchasing patterns, resistance by healthcare providers or uncertainty over third-party
reimbursement. Even following initial regulatory approval, the success of a product can be adversely
impacted by safety and efficacy findings in larger real-world patient populations, as well as market
entry of competitive products.
Risk Related to Financial and Economic Market Conditions
The Company faces a variety of risks associated with conducting business internationally .
The Company’s extensive operations and business activity outside the U.S. are accompanied by certain
financial, economic and political risks, including those listed below.
Foreign Currency Exchange : In fiscal 2020, approximately 48% of the Company’s sales occurred outside
of the U.S., with approximately 23% in Europe, 7% in the Western Hemisphere, excluding the U.S., and
18% in the Asia-Pacific and Africa region. Changes in non-U.S. currencies relative to the U.S. dollar
impact the Company’s revenues and expenses. While the Company uses financial instruments to mitigate
the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on its cash flows, unhedged exposures continue
to be subject to currency fluctuations. In addition, the weakening or strengthening of the U.S.
dollar may result in significant favorable or unfavorable translation effects when the operating
results of the Company’s non-U.S. business activity are translated into U.S. dollars.
Inflation and Currency Devaluation Risks : The Company faces challenges in maintaining profitability
of operations in economies experiencing high inflation rates. The Company has accounted for
operations in Argentina (beginning in the fiscal third quarter of 2018) and Venezuela as highly
inflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. While the Company
strives to maintain profit margins in these areas through cost reduction programs, productivity
improvements and periodic price increases, it might experience operating losses as a result of
continued inflation. In addition, the impact of currency devaluations in countries experiencing high
inflation rates or significant currency exchange fluctuations could negatively impact the Company’s
operating results.
Illegal Importation of Pharmaceutical Products : The illegal importation of pharmaceutical products
from countries where government price controls or other market dynamics result in lower prices may
adversely affect the Company’s sales and profitability in the U.S. and other countries in which the
Company operates. With the exception of limited quantities of prescription drugs for personal use,
foreign imports of pharmaceutical products are illegal under current U.S. law. However, the volume of
illegal imports continues to rise as the ability of patients and other customers to obtain the lower-
priced imports has grown significantly.
Anti-Bribery and Other Regulations: The Company is subject to various federal and foreign laws that
govern its international business practices with respect to payments to government officials. Those
laws include the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which prohibits U.S. publicly traded
companies from promising, offering, or giving anything of value to foreign officials with the corrupt
intent of influencing the foreign official for the purpose of helping the Company obtain or retain
business or gain any improper advantage. The Company’s business is heavily regulated and therefore
involves significant interaction with foreign officials. Also, in many countries outside the U.S.,
the health care providers who prescribe human pharmaceuticals are employed by the government and the
purchasers of human pharmaceuticals are government entities;
 11 
therefore, the Company’s interactions with these prescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation
under the FCPA. In addition to the U.S. application and enforcement of the FCPA, various
jurisdictions in which the Company operates have laws and regulations, including the U.K Bribery Act
2010, aimed at preventing and penalizing corrupt and anticompetitive behavior. Enforcement activities
under these laws could subject the Company to additional administrative and legal proceedings and
actions, which could include claims for civil penalties, criminal sanctions, and administrative
remedies, including exclusion from health care programs.
Other Legal, Social and Political Risks . Other risks inherent in conducting business globally
include:
• protective economic policies taken by governments such as trade protection measures and
import/export licensing requirements;
• compliance with local regulations and laws including, in some countries, regulatory requirements
restricting the Company’s ability to manufacture or sell its products in the relevant market;
• diminished protection of intellectual property and contractual rights in certain jurisdictions;
• potential nationalization or expropriation of the Company’s foreign assets;
• political or social upheavals, economic instability, repression, or human rights issues; and
• geopolitical events, including natural disasters, disruptions to markets due to war, armed
conflict, terrorism, epidemics or pandemics.
Failure to maintain a satisfactory credit rating could adversely affect our liquidity, capital
position, borrowing costs and access to capital markets.
We currently maintain investment grade credit ratings with Moody's Investors Service and Standard &
Poor's Ratings Services. Rating agencies routinely evaluate us, and their ratings of our long-term
and short-term debt are based on a number of factors. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit
rating agency, whether as a result of our actions or factors which are beyond our control, can
increase the cost of borrowing under any indebtedness we may incur, reduce market capacity for our
commercial paper or require the posting of additional collateral under our derivative contracts.
There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our credit ratings, and any additional
actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings, including any announcement that
our ratings are under review for a downgrade, may have a negative impact on our liquidity, capital
position and access to capital markets.
 Other Risks 
Our business depends on our ability to recruit and retain talented, highly skilled employees and a
diverse workforce.
Our continued growth requires us to recruit and retain talented employees representing diverse
backgrounds, experiences, and skill sets. The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our
industry is extremely competitive and our ability to compete depends on our ability to hire, develop
and motivate highly skilled personnel in all areas of our organization. Maintaining our brand and
reputation, as well as a diverse, equitable and inclusive work environment enables us to attract top
talent. If we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain highly skilled
workers and key leaders, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be
adversely affected. In addition, effective succession planning is important to our long-term success.
Any unsuccessful implementation of our succession plans or failure to ensure effective transfer of
knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could adversely affect our business,
financial condition, or results of operations.
An information security incident, including a cybersecurity breach, could have a negative impact to
the Company’s business or reputation.
To meet business objectives, the Company relies on both internal technology (IT) systems and
networks, and those of third parties and their vendors, to process and store sensitive data,
including confidential research, business plans, financial information, intellectual property, and
personal data that may be subject to legal protection, and ensure the continuity of the Company’s
supply chain. The extensive information security and cybersecurity threats, which affect companies
globally, pose a risk to the security and availability of these systems and networks, and the
confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the Company’s sensitive data. The Company continually
assesses these threats and makes investments to increase internal protection, detection, and response
capabilities, as well as ensure the Company’s third-party providers have required capabilities and
controls, to address this risk . To date, the Company has not experienced any material impact to the
business or operations resulting from information or cybersecurity attacks; however, because of the
frequently changing attack techniques, along with the increased volume and sophistication of the
attacks, there is the potential for the Company to be adversely impacted. This impact could result in
reputational, competitive, operational or other business harm as well as financial costs and
 12 
regulatory action. The Company maintains cybersecurity insurance in the event of an information
security or cyber incident; however, the coverage may not be sufficient to cover all financial,
legal, business or reputational losses.
Climate change or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change may negatively
affect our business and results of operations.
Climate change resulting from increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases
in the atmosphere could present risks to our operations, including an adverse impact on global
temperatures, weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural
disasters. Natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, such as a hurricane, tornado,
earthquake, wildfire or flooding, may pose physical risks to our facilities and disrupt the operation
of our supply chain. The impacts of the changing climate on water resources may result in water
scarcity, limiting our ability to access sufficient high-quality water in certain locations, which
may increase operational costs.
Concern over climate change may also result in new or additional legal or regulatory requirements
designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and/or mitigate the effects of climate change on the
environment. If such laws or regulations are more stringent than current legal or regulatory
obligations, we may experience disruption in, or an increase in the costs associated with sourcing,
manufacturing and distribution of our products, which may adversely affect our business, results of
operations or financial condition

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition of this Report.
The Company's subsidiaries generally seek to own, rather than lease, their manufacturing facilities,
although some, principally in non-U.S. locations, are leased. Office and warehouse facilities are
often leased. The Company also engages contract manufacturers.
The Company is committed to maintaining all of its properties in good operating condition.
McNEIL-PPC, Inc. (now Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc.) (McNEIL-PPC) continues to operate under a
consent decree, signed in 2011 with the FDA, which governs certain McNeil Consumer Healthcare
manufacturing operations, and requires McNEIL-PPC to remediate the facilities it operates in
Lancaster, Pennsylvania, Fort Washington, Pennsylvania, and Las Piedras, Puerto Rico (the "Consent
Decree"). Following FDA inspections McNEIL-PPC received notifications from the FDA that all three
manufacturing facilities are in conformity with applicable laws and regulations, and commercial
production restarted in 2015.
Under the Consent Decree, after receiving notice from the FDA of being in compliance with applicable
laws and regulations, each of the three facilities is subject to a five-year audit period by a third-
party cGMP expert. A third-party expert continued to reassess the sites at various times through
2020. McNEIL-PPC is awaiting FDA inspections of the facilities which have been delayed due to
COVID-19.
