 Customer Priorities 
Transform Infrastructure
In an increasingly digital and connected world, where each new connection to the Internet puts more
demand on the network, our customers are looking to modernize and transform their infrastructure in
an automated way in order to manage and monitor each connection in real time. Our strategy to help
our customers transform their infrastructure with the network at the core began with Software-Defined
Access (SD-Access) technology, one of our leading enterprise architectures, and continued with the
launch of our Catalyst 9000 series of switches.
We have continued to transform our enterprise access portfolio by bringing together several
technologies to form the only integrated architecture with built-in simplicity, automation and
security at the foundation. This architecture is designed to enable our customers to securely connect
their users and devices to applications and data over any network, no matter where they are.
We have introduced several innovations that extend our networking capabilities to wireless and
enterprise routing products, including Software-Defined Wide Area Network (SD-WAN) and Internet of
Things (IoT) edge platforms. Our SD-WAN solutions are designed to provide direct branch to cloud
connectivity, enabling the workforce to access their software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications and
workloads in an optimized and highly secure manner. We have continued to expand our SD-WAN offering,
through our Cloud OnRamp integrations with several webscale providers to deliver predictable and
highly secure application experiences.
To further our innovation in this area, we are applying the latest technologies, such as machine
learning and advanced analytics, to operate and enhance network capabilities. These network product
offerings are designed to help enable customers to detect cybersecurity threats, even in encrypted
traffic. As such, we have created, in our view, the only network that is designed for security while
also helping to maintain privacy.
Our customers are operating in multicloud environments with private, public and hybrid clouds. For
the data center, our strategy is to deliver multicloud architectures that bring policy and
operational consistency, regardless of where applications or data reside, by extending our
Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) and our hyperconverged offerings. We continue to invest in
our data center portfolio to help meet the growing demand for cloud-delivered technologies. Our Nexus
Cloud platform is designed to help our customers deploy, manage, and operate their data center
networks from the cloud.
Our technology strategy for the Internet for the Future is aimed at addressing the broad adoption of
multicloud and application environments. We continue to make significant investments in the
development of software, silicon and optics — which we believe are the building blocks for the
Internet for the Future.
We introduced Cisco Silicon One, a single unified silicon architecture, as well as the Cisco 8000
carrier-class router family built on Cisco Silicon One and our operating system, Cisco IOS XR7. We
have also expanded our Cisco Silicon One platform from a routing focused solution to one which
addresses the webscale switching market. By combining our routed optical networking solution
integrating our routers with pluggable optics, we can further help deliver cost savings to our
customers.
Secure the Enterprise
With the rapid growth in modern applications, and with more distributed work environments, securing
the enterprise has become more complex and difficult for our customers to manage. We believe every
organization requires new or enhanced security architectures to defend against increasing cyber
attacks. Our security strategy is focused on delivering a simple and effective cyber-security
architecture combining network, cloud and endpoint-based solutions that recognizes the critical
importance of data privacy.
We are investing significant resources across our security portfolio focused on cloud-based
offerings, artificial intelligence-driven threat detection and end-to-end security architectures. We
unveiled our strategic plan for a global, cloud-delivered, integrated platform that secures and
connects organizations of any shape and size. Cisco Security Cloud is designed to be the most open,
end-to-end, security platform across hybrid multi-cloud environments, while also minimizing the
attack surface and automating security policies across an organization’s environment. This extends to
our secure access service edge (SASE) framework and Zero Trust architecture, where we have developed
a cloud-delivered stack. We are also delivering unified detection and response capabilities with
Cisco Extended Detection and Response (XDR), a cloud-based solution, and introduced new innovations
across firewall, multicloud and application security capabilities. To enable a more optimized hybrid
work experience with simple access across any location, device, and application, we have brought to
market a security service edge (SSE) solution. Additionally, we have announced generative AI
capabilities as part of our Security Cloud platform to simplify security operations and increase
efficiency.

Power Hybrid Work
Over the last several years, the world has shifted to a hybrid work environment, and we believe that
our customers are looking to support a blend of onsite and offsite workers into the future. To enable
a hybrid workforce, customers require secure access, collaboration, and technologies to empower their
teams to connect seamlessly and to work from anywhere.
Customers are looking to us to help improve how their people communicate, collaborate and to increase
productivity. At Cisco, we are focused on providing and delivering highly secure collaboration
experiences to help our customers create a secure hybrid work environment.
We believe our collaboration portfolio, which includes our subscription-based Webex conferencing
platform, with meetings, devices, calling and messaging, is at the center of our customers’ strategy
for enabling their teams to be more productive and secure. To help our customers transform their
workplaces, we continue to invest to expand our capabilities by introducing new Webex Calling
innovations in the Webex Suite to improve work flexibility, reliability, and quality. We also
launched new devices for hybrid work which we are making interoperable with other vendors’
collaboration offerings to create a seamless user experience.
Reimagine Applications
In our view, over the next several years, customers will be increasingly writing modern software
applications that can run on any hybrid cloud and will be adding billions of connections to their
environments. In a multicloud environment, customers must reimagine how they design, develop and
deploy their applications. They need to be able to build applications quickly, deploy them nearly
anywhere, monitor experiences, and act in real time.
We believe we are uniquely positioned to enable successful business outcomes for customers in hybrid
and multicloud environments. In our view, networks are increasingly critical to business success and
we believe our customers will benefit from the insights and intelligence that we are making
accessible through our highly differentiated platforms.
We are continuing our commitment to deliver full stack observability from the application to the
infrastructure to give our customers greater insights that enable faster, better decision making. We
are doing this by adding key elements to our portfolio, such as: infrastructure optimization with
Intersight, network monitoring with technology from ThousandEyes, application performance monitoring
with AppDynamics, as well as our security innovations.
Journey to Sustainability
The world faces serious environmental challenges, such as climate change, resource depletion, and
biodiversity loss, and, as a large global corporation, Cisco can play a role in supporting mitigation
of these challenges. Our strategy focuses on accelerating the transition to clean energy, evolving
our business from linear to circular, and investing in resilient ecosystems. We are striving to
reduce our own environmental footprint, and to use our technology and expertise to help our customers
and suppliers reduce theirs, contributing to a healthier and more resilient planet. Additionally, we
have set long-term goals to address the environmental impacts from our products and business
operations.
We strive to reduce the effects of our operations and supply chain, help our customers decrease
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and support our communities experiencing direct effects of a changing
climate by, among others:
• Continuing to invest in renewable energy, including investments in solar and wind energy;
• Designing our products and packaging for reuse, repair, recycling, and resource efficiency and
managing our equipment for multiple lifecycles;
• Continuing to standardize visibility and insights across our portfolio to enable customers to
measure, monitor, and manage energy consumption;
• Investing in projects to improve the efficiency of our offices, labs, and data centers worldwide;
• Working with our component suppliers, manufacturing partners, and logistic providers to reduce
emissions and set goals for absolute GHG emissions reductions;
• Helping our employees to engage with events and opportunities to raise awareness and create a sense
of community around sustainability; and
• Providing critical connectivity in the aftermath of natural disasters.

and better user experiences. We are investing in new opportunities in AI, launching new technologies
across our product portfolios designed to boost productivity, enhance policy management and simplify
tasks. Our AI-scale infrastructure will allow our customers to process AI workloads more efficiently.
We are also accelerating our efforts to enable the delivery of network functionality as a service as
our customers increasingly want to consume technologies in flexible ways. We made the initial step
with our as-a-service portfolio, Cisco Plus, and our first offer, Cisco Plus hybrid cloud, which
combines our data center compute, networking and storage portfolio. Cisco Plus includes our plans to
deliver networking-as-a-service, which is designed to unify networking, security and observability
across access, wide area network (WAN), and cloud domains.
 Transforming our Business Model 
We are transforming our offerings to meet the evolving needs of our customers. Historically, our
various networking technology products have aligned with their respective product categories.
However, increasingly our offerings are crossing multiple product categories. As our core networking
offerings evolve, we expect we will add more common software features across our core networking
platforms. We are increasing the amount of software offerings that we provide and the proportion of
subscription software offerings. We have various software offerings that fall into the broad
categories of subscription arrangements and perpetual licenses. Our subscription arrangements include
term software licenses and associated service arrangements, as well as SaaS.
As part of the transformation of our business, we continued to make strides to develop and sell more
software and subscription-based offerings. We are also focused on the entire customer lifecycle to
drive expansion and renewals. We will continue to invest in network-as-a-service offerings to provide
our customers with flexibility in how they want to consume our technologies.
For a discussion of the risks associated with our strategy, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” including
the risk factor entitled “We depend upon the development of new products and services, and
enhancements to existing products and services, and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging
technological trends and customers’ changing needs, our operating results and market share may
suffer.” For information regarding sales of our major products and services, see Note 19 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

In addition to our product offerings, we provide a broad range of service and support options for our
customers. Our overall service and support offerings are combined into one organization, Customer
Experience, that is responsible for the end-to-end customer experience.
Our support and maintenance services help our customers ensure their products operate efficiently,
remain available, and benefit from the most up-to-date system and application software. These
services help customers protect their network investments, manage risk, and minimize downtime for
systems running mission-critical applications.
We also provide comprehensive advisory services that are focused on responsive, preventive, and
consultative support of our technologies for specific networking needs. We are investing in and
expanding advisory services in the areas of software, cloud, security, and analytics, which reflects
our strategy of selling customer outcomes. We are focused on three priorities: utilizing technology
advisory services to drive higher product and services; assessment and migration services providing
the tools, expertise and methodologies to enable our customers to migrate to new technology
platforms; and providing optimization services aligned with customers’ business expectations.
 Customers and Markets 
Many factors influence the IT, collaboration, and networking requirements of our customers. These
include the size of the organization, number and types of technology systems, geographic location,
and business applications deployed throughout the customer’s network. Our customer base is not
limited to any specific industry, geography, or market segment. Our customers primarily operate in
the following markets: enterprise, commercial, service provider, and public sector.
 Enterprise 
Enterprise businesses are large regional, national, or global organizations with multiple locations
or branch offices. Many enterprise businesses have unique IT, collaboration, and networking needs
within a multivendor environment. We offer service and support packages, financing, and managed
network services, primarily through our service provider partners. We sell these products through a
network of third-party application and technology vendors and channel partners, as well as selling
directly to these customers.
 Commercial 
The commercial market represents larger, or midmarket and small businesses. We sell to our midmarket
customers through a combination of our direct sales force and channel partners. These customers
typically require the latest advanced technologies that our enterprise customers demand, but with
less complexity. Small businesses require information technologies and communications products that
are easy to configure, install, and maintain. We sell to these smaller organizations within the
commercial market primarily through channel partners.
 Service Providers 
Service providers offer data, voice, video, and mobile/wireless services to businesses, governments,
utilities, and consumers worldwide. The service provider market includes regional, national, and
international wireline carriers, webscale operators as well as Internet, cable, and wireless
providers. We also include media, broadcast, and content providers within our service provider
market, as the lines in the telecommunications industry continue to blur between traditional network-
based, content-based and application-based services. Service providers use a variety of our products
and services for their own networks. In addition, many service providers use Cisco data center,
virtualization, and collaboration technologies to offer managed or Internet-based services to their
business customers. Compared with other customers, service providers are more likely to require
network design, deployment, and support services because of the greater scale and higher complexity
of their networks, whose requirements are addressed, we believe, by our architectural approach.

Table of Contents
 Public Sector 
The public sector market includes federal, state and local governments, as well as educational
institution customers. Many public sector customers have unique IT, collaboration, and networking
needs within a multi-vendor environment. We sell to public sector customers through a network of
third-party application and technology vendors, channel partners, as well as through direct sales.
 Sales Overview 
As of the end of fiscal 2023, our worldwide sales and marketing functions consisted of approximately
26,000 employees, including managers, sales representatives, and technical support personnel. We sell
our products and services both directly and indirectly through a variety of channels with support
from our salesforce. A substantial portion of our products and services is sold indirectly through
channel partners, and the remainder is sold through direct sales. Channel partners include systems
integrators, service providers, other third-party resellers, and distributors.
Systems integrators and service providers typically sell directly to end users and often provide
system installation, technical support, professional services, and other support services in addition
to network equipment sales. Systems integrators also typically integrate our products into an overall
solution. Some service providers are also systems integrators.
Distributors may hold inventory and sell to systems integrators, service providers, and other third-
party resellers. We refer to sales through distributors as our two-tier system of sales to the end
customer. Revenue from two-tier distributors is recognized based on a sell-in method. These
distributors may be given business terms that allow them to return a limited portion of inventory,
receive credits for changes in selling prices, receive certain rebates, and participate in various
cooperative marketing programs.
For information regarding risks related to our sales channels, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” including
the risk factors entitled “Disruption of or changes in our distribution model could harm our sales
and margins” and “Inventory management relating to our sales to our two-tier distribution channel is
complex, and excess inventory may harm our gross margins.”
For information regarding risks relating to our international operations, see “Item 1A. Risk
Factors,” including the risk factors entitled “Our operating results may be adversely affected by
unfavorable economic and market conditions and the uncertain geopolitical environment;” “Entrance
into new or developing markets exposes us to additional competition and will likely increase demands
on our service and support operations;” “Due to the global nature of our operations, political or
economic changes or other factors in a specific country or region could harm our operating results
and financial condition;” “We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could
negatively impact our financial results and cash flows;” and “Cyber attacks, data breaches or other
incidents may disrupt our operations, harm our operating results and financial condition, and damage
our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business; and cyber attacks, data breaches or other
incidents on our customers’ or third-party providers’ networks, or in cloud-based services provided
to, by, or enabled by us, could result in claims of liability against us, give rise to legal and/or
regulatory action, damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business,” among others.
Our service offerings complement our products through a range of consulting, technical, project,
quality, and software maintenance services, including 24-hour online and telephone support through
technical assistance centers.
 Financing Arrangements 
We provide financing arrangements for certain qualified customers to build, maintain, and upgrade
their networks. We believe customer financing is a competitive advantage in obtaining business,
particularly for those customers involved in significant infrastructure projects. Our financing
arrangements include loans, leases (sales-type, direct financing and operating) and channels
financing arrangements.
 Acquisitions, Investments, and Alliances 
The markets in which we compete require a wide variety of technologies, products, and capabilities.
We continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire and invest in businesses and technologies that
complement and enable further investment in our key priority areas.
 Acquisitions 
We acquire companies in order to gain access to talent, technology, products and features,
operational capabilities or new markets. The risks associated with acquisitions are more fully
discussed in “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” including the risk factor entitled “We have made and expect to
continue to make acquisitions that could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results.”

Table of Contents
 Investments in Privately Held Companies 
We make investments in privately held companies that develop technology or provide services that are
complementary to our products or that provide insights into emerging technologies that may become
relevant to our businesses. The risks associated with these investments are more fully discussed in
“Item 1A. Risk Factors,” including the risk factor entitled “We are exposed to fluctuations in the
market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates; impairment of our investments could
harm our earnings.”
 Strategic Alliances 
We pursue strategic alliances with other companies in areas where collaboration can produce industry
advancement and accelerate new markets. The objectives and goals of a strategic alliance can include
technology exchange, product development, joint sales and marketing, or new market creation.
Companies with which we have strategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas, and
in our view this trend may increase. The risks associated with our strategic alliances are more fully
discussed in “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” including the risk factor entitled “If we do not successfully
manage our strategic alliances, we may not realize the expected benefits from such alliances and we
may experience increased competition or delays in product development.”
 Competition 
We compete in the networking and communications equipment markets, providing products and services
designed to transport, and help secure data, voice, and video traffic across cloud, private and
public networks and the Internet. These market factors represent a competitive threat to us. We
compete with numerous vendors in each product category. The overall number of our competitors
providing niche product solutions may increase. Also, the identity and composition of competitors may
change as we increase our activity in newer product areas, and in key priority and growth areas. As
we continue to expand globally, we may see new competition in different geographic regions. In
particular, we have experienced price-focused competition from competitors in Asia, especially from
China, and we anticipate this will continue.
Our competitors (in each case relative to only some of our products or services) include: Amazon Web
Services LLC; Arista Networks, Inc.; Broadcom Inc.; Ciena Corporation; CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.;
Datadog Inc.; Dell Technologies Inc.; Dynatrace Inc.; Fortinet, Inc.; Hewlett-Packard Enterprise
Company; Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd.; Juniper Networks, Inc.; Microsoft Corporation; New Relic,
Inc.; Nokia Corporation; Nvidia Corporation; Palo Alto Networks, Inc.; RingCentral, Inc.; VMware,
Inc.; Zoom Video Communications, Inc.; and Zscaler, Inc.; among others.
Some of our competitors compete across many of our product lines, while others are primarily focused
in a specific product area. Barriers to entry are relatively low, and new ventures to create products
that do or could compete with our products are regularly formed. In addition, some of our competitors
may have greater resources, including technical and engineering resources, than we do. As we expand
into new markets, we will face competition not only from our existing competitors but also from other
competitors, including existing companies with strong technological, marketing, and sales positions
in those markets. We also sometimes face competition from resellers and distributors of our products.
Companies with which we have strategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas, and
this trend may increase. For example, the enterprise data center is undergoing a fundamental
transformation arising from the convergence of technologies, including computing, networking,
storage, and software, that previously were segregated. Additionally, companies that are strategic
alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors,
thereby reducing their business with us.
The principal competitive factors in the markets in which we presently compete and may compete in the
future include the ability to sell successful business outcomes; the ability to provide a broad range
of networking and communications products and services; product performance; price; the ability to
introduce new products, including providing continuous new customer value and products with price-
performance advantages; the ability to reduce production costs; the ability to provide value-added
features such as security, reliability, and investment protection; conformance to standards; market
presence; the ability to provide financing; and disruptive technology shifts and new business models.
We also face competition from customers to which we license or supply technology and suppliers from
which we transfer technology. The inherent nature of networking requires interoperability. As such,
we must cooperate and, at the same time, compete with many companies. Any inability to effectively
manage these complicated relationships with customers, suppliers, and strategic alliance partners
could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition and
accordingly affect our chances of success.

 Research and Development 
We regularly introduce new products and features to address the requirements of our markets. We
allocate our research and development budget among our product categories, which consist of Secure,
Agile Networks; Internet for the Future; Collaboration; End-to-End Security; Optimized Application
Experiences; and Other Product technologies. Our research and development expenditures are applied
generally to all product areas, with specific areas of focus being identified from time to time. Our
expenditures for research and development costs were expensed as incurred.
The industry in which we compete is subject to rapid technological developments, evolving standards,
changes in customer requirements, and new product introductions and enhancements. As a result, our
success depends, in part, on our ability, on a cost-effective and timely basis, to continue to
enhance our existing products and to develop and introduce new products that improve performance and
reduce total cost of ownership. To achieve these objectives, our management and engineering personnel
work with customers to identify and respond to customer needs, as well as with other innovators of
Internet networking products, including universities, laboratories, and corporations. We also expect
to continue to make acquisitions and strategic investments, where appropriate, to provide us with
access to new technologies. Nonetheless, there can be no assurance that we will be able to
successfully develop products to address new customer requirements and technological changes or that
those products will achieve market acceptance.
 Manufacturing 
We rely on contract manufacturers for our manufacturing needs. We presently use a variety of
independent third-party companies to provide services related to printed-circuit board assembly, in-
circuit test, product repair, and product assembly. Proprietary software in electronically
programmable memory chips is used to configure products that meet customer requirements and to
maintain quality control and security. The manufacturing process enables us to configure the hardware
and software in unique combinations to meet a wide variety of individual customer requirements. The
manufacturing process also uses automated testing equipment and burn-in procedures, as well as
comprehensive inspection, testing, and statistical process controls, which are designed to help
ensure the quality and reliability of our products. The manufacturing processes and procedures are
generally certified to International Organization for Standardization 9001 standards.
Our arrangements with contract manufacturers generally provide for quality, cost, and delivery
requirements, as well as manufacturing process terms, such as continuity of supply; inventory
management; flexibility regarding capacity, quality, and cost management; oversight of manufacturing;
and conditions for use of our intellectual property. We have not entered into any significant long-
term contracts with any manufacturing service provider. We generally have the option to renew
arrangements on an as-needed basis. These arrangements generally do not commit us to purchase any
particular amount or any quantities beyond amounts covered by orders or forecasts that we submit
covering discrete periods of time.
 Patents, Intellectual Property, and Licensing 
We seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products through the
use of patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secret laws. We have a program to file applications
for and obtain patents, copyrights, and trademarks in the United States and in selected foreign
countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate. We also seek to maintain our
trade secrets and confidential information by nondisclosure policies and through the use of
appropriate confidentiality agreements. We have obtained a substantial number of patents and
trademarks in the United States and in other countries. There can be no assurance, however, that the
rights obtained can be successfully enforced against infringing products in every jurisdiction.
Although we believe the protection afforded by our patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets
has value, the rapidly changing technology in the networking industry and uncertainties in the legal
process make our future success dependent primarily on the innovative skills, technological
expertise, and management abilities of our employees rather than on the protection afforded by
patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws.
Many of our products are designed to include software or other intellectual property licensed from
third parties. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various
aspects of our products, we believe, based upon past experience and standard industry practice, that
such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. Nonetheless, there can be
no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Our
inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on
favorable terms, or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters, could have a material
adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Moreover, inclusion in
our products of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive
basis can limit our ability to protect our proprietary rights in our products.

The industry in which we compete is characterized by rapidly changing technology, a large number of
patents, and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property
rights. There can be no assurance that our patents and other proprietary rights will not be
challenged, invalidated, or circumvented; that others will not assert intellectual property rights to
technologies that are relevant to us; or that our rights will give us a competitive advantage. In
addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same
extent as the laws of the United States. The risks associated with patents and intellectual property
are more fully discussed in “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” including the risk factors entitled “Our
proprietary rights may prove difficult to enforce,” “We may be found to infringe on intellectual
property rights of others,” and “We rely on the availability of third-party licenses.”
 Government Regulation 
We are subject to numerous regulations and laws in the United States and abroad that involve matters
central to our business. Many of these regulations and laws are evolving and their applicability and
scope, as interpreted by courts and regulators, remain uncertain. These regulations and laws involve
a variety of matters including privacy, data protection and personal information, tax, trade,
encryption technology, environmental sustainability (including climate change), human rights, product
certification, and national security.
A failure, or alleged failure, by us to comply with regulations or laws could have a material adverse
effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition. For additional information about
government regulation and laws applicable to our business, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” including the
risk factor entitled “Our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially
harmed by evolving regulatory uncertainty or obligations applicable to our products and services” and
Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, subsection (f) “Legal Proceedings.”
 Talent and Culture 
At Cisco, we value our people and our technology, and we leverage our broader ecosystems to
positively impact the world and pursue our purpose to Power an Inclusive Future for All. Our goal is
to attract, retain, and develop talent in order to help our customers connect, secure, and accelerate
their digital agility. Our relationship with our employees is one of mutual benefit. Our employees
bring talent and ingenuity to everything we do, and in turn, we provide employees with meaningful
careers and development opportunities.
For the third year in a row, Cisco has been named the number one company to work for in Fortune
Magazine’s 100 Best Companies to Work For® 2023 rankings in the United States. Fortune and Great
Place to Work have published their United States rankings for the past 26 years, and Cisco has been
recognized on every annual list. Cisco has also received top ranking in 15 additional countries,
including Australia, Canada, Costa Rica, Mexico, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Saudi Arabia, Singapore,
Indonesia, Japan, Spain, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and Vietnam.
As of July 29, 2023, we had approximately 84,900 employees and they are categorized as follows:
We support our employees through times of change and enable them to be their best. We do this by
fostering a Conscious Culture. Conscious Culture speaks to the importance of everyone being aware —
“conscious” — of the environment they are part of, and feeling accountable, empowered, and expected
to contribute to creating a culture where all Cisco employees feel safe and can thrive. We’re aware
of how we treat one another and speak up when we see behavior that’s out of step with our beliefs.
There is a direct connection between the culture we create internally and how our people are helping
bring about a better world.
In the same way that every employee at Cisco is responsible for our Conscious Culture, we also want
every employee to feel responsible for and contribute to our purpose to Power an Inclusive Future for
All. This is as much a commitment from Cisco as it is from our employees. Our people often ask the
toughest questions around how we are impacting society for the better, from
 10 
Table of Contents
addressing homelessness to combating climate change. And often the best ideas for how we can do even
more come directly from them. Future employees expect it too. More and more, talent want to work for
a company where their work has meaning and where they see their values reflected in the organization.
Inclusion & Diversity
Inclusion and diversity are core components in our Conscious Culture. Inclusivity is our strength and
our priority. We want every employee to feel valued, respected, and heard. We are prioritizing
inclusion and diversity across the company, recognizing that connecting people of all experiences and
backgrounds allows us to improve innovation and collaboration.
In order to continue accelerating diversity and finding extraordinary talent, we have designed a
framework that includes introducing new tools and technologies to help accurately map the talent
market, creating job roles that attract highly qualified diverse candidates, and expanding the
diversity within our interview panels.
We currently have a total of 29 Inclusive Communities comprised of 11 Employee Resource Organizations
and 18 Employee Networks supporting full-spectrum diversity globally, including gender, ethnicity,
race, sexual orientation, age, ability, veteran status, religion, culture, background, as well as
varied experiences, strengths, and perspectives. These thriving communities continue to be a source
of strength and support for employees, and they help to foster a more conscious culture by providing
opportunities for proximity and learning.
Cisco has signed the CEO Action for Diversity and Inclusion Pledge. The CEO Action for Diversity &
Inclusion Pledge is a CEO-driven pledge to drive measurable action and meaningful change in advancing
diversity, equity and inclusion in the workplace. This year, Cisco also signed The Valuable 500
statement, a global movement putting disability inclusion on the business leadership agenda and
celebrating those committed to inclusion. We are delivering on these actions by accelerating
diversity across the full-spectrum of diversity — including gender, age, race, ethnicity, sexual
orientation, ability, nationality, religion, veteran status, background, culture, experience,
strengths and perspectives. At Cisco, it starts at the top: 42% of our Executive Leadership Team
(ELT) are women and 50% are diverse in terms of ethnicity.
We publish certain gender diversity and ethnic diversity workforce data annually. Across our global
company, we have driven broad improvements in overall workforce diversity. Based on our fiscal 2022
data which excludes certain acquisitions, our global employee base was comprised of 29% women, 71%
men and 0.1% nonbinary, and our U.S. employee base was comprised of the following ethnicities: 50.9%
White/Caucasian, 34.6% Asian, 6.6% Hispanic/Latino, 5.5% African American/Black, 1.9% two or more
races (not Hispanic or Latino), 0.3% American Indian or Alaska Native and 0.2% Native Hawaiian/Other
Pacific Islander.
With respect to social justice, Cisco has been partnering across the globe to scale and amplify our
positive impact. We have published our Social Justice Beliefs & Actions, which is our blueprint for
how we respond to injustice and address inequity for any community. We are creating actions that can
be replicated and scaled and are designed to cover the full spectrum of diversity, inclusive of
gender, generation, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, ability, nationality, and background — the
foundation of our Conscious Culture. This work is part of a plan for Cisco to drive transformational,
generational impact for vulnerable communities. Our Social Justice Action Office helps drive
accountability, progress, and excellence in our strategic actions in this area, which are designed to
address the broader ecosystem including our employees, partners, customers, and suppliers.
Compensation and Benefits
Our total compensation philosophy is designed to attract, reward, and retain talent. It provides
market competitive, performance-based compensation aligned with each employee’s contribution and
impact to the value we drive to our customers, partners and stockholders. We reward and recognize our
employees for effecting innovation, collaboration, profitability, and growth within our geographies,
product lines, and functions.
Cisco has always been committed to compensating our employees fairly and equitably. We are a founding
signer of the White House Equal Pay Pledge and the Parity.org pledge, and are a leader in the charge
to make fair pay a reality for all employees through the Employers for Pay Equity Consortium. We have
also introduced an innovative and inclusive framework that provides us powerful analytics to evaluate
our complex compensation system. For example, by using these powerful analytics, we are able to test
for pay parity on a regular basis, and when gaps are found, we strive to correct them.
As part of our Social Justice Beliefs and Actions, we have expanded our pay parity program beyond
base salary to include additional forms of compensation fairness such as promotion, bonuses, and
stock decisions made in our rewards programs. We aim to ensure the program addresses all employees
across the full spectrum of diversity incorporating our global self-reported data collection.

Health & Well-being
We have an ongoing commitment to focus on the health, safety, and well-being of our employees. We
provide our employees and their families with high-quality, flexible, and convenient benefits and
resources for their physical, mental, and financial well-being. We strive to support our employees as
they balance careers and personal lives, as well as their own physical, emotional, and financial
health. We continue to emphasize a focus on both physical and mental health, recognizing the need to
create an environment where employees can speak openly about mental health and other matters.
We have hosted discussions during Cisco Check-Ins, expanded our Safe to Talk program, introduced
mindfulness courses, enhanced our Employee Assistance Program offerings, improved the out-of-network
provider benefit for substance abuse and mental health treatment, and more. In fiscal 2023, we
continued to offer employees “A Day for Me,” which were paid days off that allowed for each
individual to recharge and rest. We have moved towards a hybrid work model in certain countries,
giving our employees the flexibility to work offsite or at onsite Cisco locations.
Employee Development
We know careers are not static pathways that look the same for everyone. We also know that the world
of work will continue to rapidly evolve, requiring new skillsets. At Cisco, we believe that your
career is owned by you, supported by your leader, and enabled by Cisco. This means that while each
employee has the power to shape their career on their own terms, they also have a supportive
ecosystem to develop the skills they need to succeed both today and tomorrow. We strive to create a
culture of “one company, many careers.” In fiscal 2023, we launched a new career strategy for our
people focused on areas we know determine a successful career at Cisco—personal brand, network,
expertise, and experience—and created customized offerings that map to each of them.
Employee Engagement
We believe that strong communication is key in our Conscious Culture. This communication includes
regular, virtual all hands, which we refer to as a “Cisco Check-In,” and weekly team leader check-
ins, which we refer to as a “Team Space Check-In.” Our regular virtual Cisco Check-Ins were initially
launched with a focus on sharing medical information at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Cisco
Check-Ins have since evolved into a forum where we can discuss much more with our employees, from
business updates to social justice to physical and mental health.
In fiscal 2023, we have seen a high level of employee engagement. For example, there were
approximately 2.3 million Team Space Check-Ins by our employees in fiscal 2023, reflecting
approximately 73,500 employees submitting Team Space Check-Ins. Employees also participate in our
global Engagement Pulse Survey and the Real Deal Survey. These surveys allow our employees to provide
confidential feedback on our culture, company strategy and trust in their direct leaders.

 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
Set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the SEC are
descriptions of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially
from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report.
 Risks Related to our Business and Industry 
Our operating results may fluctuate in future periods, which may adversely affect our stock price.
Our operating results have been in the past, and will continue to be, subject to quarterly and annual
fluctuations as a result of numerous factors, some of which may contribute to more pronounced
fluctuations in an uncertain global economic environment. These factors include:
• Fluctuations in demand for our products and services, especially with respect to service providers
and Internet businesses, in part due to changes in the global economic environment
• Changes in sales and implementation cycles for our products and reduced visibility into our
customers’ spending plans and associated revenue
• Our ability to maintain appropriate inventory levels and purchase commitments
• Price and product competition in the communications and networking industries, which can change
rapidly due to technological innovation and different business models from various geographic regions
• The overall movement toward industry consolidation among both our competitors and our customers
• The introduction and market acceptance of new technologies and products, and our success in new and
evolving markets, and in emerging technologies, as well as the adoption of new standards
• The transformation of our business to deliver more software and subscription offerings where
revenue is recognized over time
• Variations in sales channels, product costs, mix of products sold, or mix of direct sales and
indirect sales
• The timing, size, and mix of orders from customers
• Manufacturing and customer lead times
• Fluctuations in our gross margins, and the factors that contribute to such fluctuations
• The ability of our customers, channel partners, contract manufacturers and suppliers to obtain
financing or to fund capital expenditures, especially during a period of global credit market
disruption or in the event of customer, channel partner, contract manufacturer or supplier financial
problems
• Actual events, circumstances, outcomes, and amounts differing from judgments, assumptions, and
estimates used in determining the values of certain assets (including the amounts of related
valuation allowances), liabilities, and other items reflected in our Consolidated Financial
Statements
• How well we execute on our strategy and operating plans and the impact of changes in our business
model that could result in significant restructuring charges
• Our ability to achieve targeted cost reductions
• Benefits anticipated from our investments
• Changes in tax laws or accounting rules, or interpretations thereof
As a consequence, operating results for a particular future period are difficult to predict, and,
therefore, prior results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods.
Any of the foregoing factors, or any other factors discussed elsewhere herein, could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition that could adversely
affect our stock price.
Our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions and the
uncertain geopolitical environment.
Challenging economic conditions, including rising inflation, or other changes, worldwide have from
time to time contributed, and may continue to contribute, to slowdowns in the communications and
networking industries at large, as well as in specific segments and markets in which we operate,
resulting in: reduced demand for our products as a result of continued constraints on IT-related
capital spending by our customers, particularly service providers, and other customer markets as
well; increased price competition for our products, not only from our competitors but also as a
consequence of customers disposing of unutilized products; risk of excess and obsolete inventories;
risk of supply constraints; risk of excess facilities and manufacturing capacity; and higher overhead
costs as a percentage of revenue and higher interest expense.

Table of Contents
The global macroeconomic environment continues to be challenging and inconsistent. In certain prior
periods, we have seen a broad-based weakening in the global macroeconomic environment which has
impacted and could impact in the future certain of our markets. Additionally, instability in the
global credit markets, the impact of uncertainty regarding global central bank monetary policy, the
instability in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the world (including as a result of the
on-going Russia and Ukraine war, and China-Taiwan relations), the current economic challenges in
China, including global economic ramifications of Chinese economic difficulties, and other
disruptions may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions. If global economic and market
conditions, or economic conditions in key markets, remain uncertain or deteriorate further, we may
experience material impacts on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
Our operating results in one or more segments may also be affected by uncertain or changing economic
conditions particularly germane to that segment or to particular customer markets within that
segment. In addition, reports of certain intelligence gathering methods of the U.S. government could
affect customers’ perception of the products of IT companies which design and manufacture products in
the United States. Trust and confidence in us as an IT supplier are critical to the development and
growth of our markets. Impairment of that trust, or foreign regulatory actions taken in response to
reports of certain intelligence gathering methods of the U.S. government, could affect the demand for
our products from customers outside of the United States and could have an adverse effect on our
operating results.
Our revenue for a particular period is difficult to predict, and a shortfall in revenue may harm our
operating results.
As a result of a variety of factors discussed in this report, our revenue for a particular quarter is
difficult to predict, especially in light of a challenging and inconsistent global macroeconomic
environment (including as a result of the on-going Russia and Ukraine war), and related market
uncertainty. Our revenue may grow at a slower rate than in past periods, or decline as it did in
certain prior periods. Our ability to meet financial expectations could also be adversely affected if
the nonlinear sales pattern seen in some of our past quarters recurs in future periods. We have
experienced periods of time during which shipments have exceeded net bookings or manufacturing issues
have delayed shipments, leading to nonlinearity in shipping patterns. In addition to making it
difficult to predict revenue for a particular period, nonlinearity in shipping can increase costs,
because irregular shipment patterns result in periods of underutilized capacity and periods in which
overtime expenses may be incurred, as well as in potential additional inventory management-related
costs. In addition, to the extent that manufacturing issues and any related component shortages
result in delayed shipments in the future, and particularly in periods in which our contract
manufacturers are operating at higher levels of capacity, it is possible that revenue for a quarter
could be adversely affected if such matters occur and are not remediated within the same quarter.
The timing of large orders can also have a significant effect on our business and operating results
from quarter to quarter. From time to time, we receive large orders that have a significant effect on
our operating results in the period in which the order is recognized as revenue. The timing of such
orders is difficult to predict, and the timing of revenue recognition from such orders may affect
period to period changes in revenue. As a result, our operating results could vary materially from
quarter to quarter based on the receipt of such orders and their ultimate recognition as revenue.
Longer than normal manufacturing lead times in the past have caused, and in the future could cause,
some customers to place the same or a similar order multiple times within our various sales channels
and to cancel the duplicative orders upon shipment or receipt of the product, or to also place orders
with other vendors with shorter manufacturing lead times. Such multiple ordering (along with other
factors) or risk of order cancellation may cause difficulty in predicting our revenue. Further, our
efforts to improve manufacturing lead-time performance may result in more variability and less
predictability in our revenue and operating results. In addition, when facing component supply-
related challenges, we have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to meet customer
expectations, which in turn contribute to an increase in inventory and purchase commitments. In prior
periods, we increased our inventory and purchase commitments in light of the significant supply
constraints seen industry-wide due to component shortages. These increases in our inventory and
purchase commitments to shorten lead times could also lead to material excess and obsolete inventory
charges or other negative impacts to our product gross margin in future periods if product demand
significantly weakens for a sustained duration. We plan our operating expense levels based primarily
on forecasted revenue levels. These expenses and the impact of long-term commitments are relatively
fixed in the short term. A shortfall in revenue could lead to operating results being below
expectations because we may not be able to quickly reduce these fixed expenses in response to short-
term business changes. Any of the above factors could have a material adverse impact on our
operations and financial results. For additional information and a further discussion of impacts and
risks related to our supply constraints, inventory commitments and our purchase commitments with
contract manufacturers and suppliers, see Results of Operations—Product Gross Margin—Supply
Constraints Impacts and Risks, Liquidity and Capital Resources—Inventory Supply Chain and Note 14 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Table of Contents
Supply chain issues, including financial problems of contract manufacturers or component suppliers,
or a shortage of adequate component supply or manufacturing capacity that increase our costs or cause
a delay in our ability to fulfill orders, could have an adverse impact on our business and operating
results, and our failure to estimate customer demand properly may result in excess or obsolete
component supply, which could adversely affect our gross margins.
The fact that we do not own or operate the bulk of our manufacturing facilities and that we are
reliant on our extended supply chain could have an adverse impact on the supply of our products and
on our business and operating results. Financial problems of either contract manufacturers or
component suppliers, reservation of manufacturing capacity at our contract manufacturers by other
companies, and industry consolidation occurring within one or more component supplier markets, such
as the semiconductor market, in each case, could either limit supply or increase costs.
A reduction or interruption in supply, including disruptions on our global supply chain, caused in
part by public health emergencies, geopolitical tensions (including as a result of China-Taiwan
relations) or a significant natural disaster (including as a result of climate change); a significant
increase in the price of one or more components (including as a result of inflation); a failure to
adequately authorize procurement of inventory by our contract manufacturers; a failure to
appropriately cancel, reschedule, or adjust our requirements based on our business needs; or a
decrease in demand for our products could materially adversely affect our business, operating
results, and financial condition and could materially damage customer relationships. Furthermore, as
a result of binding price or purchase commitments with suppliers, we may be obligated to purchase
components at prices that are higher than those available in the current market. In the event that we
become committed to purchase components at prices in excess of the current market price when the
components are actually used, our gross margins could decrease. In addition, vendors may be under
pressure to allocate product to certain customers for business, regulatory or political reasons,
and/or demand changes in agreed pricing as a condition of supply. Although we have generally secured
additional supply or taken other mitigation actions when significant disruptions have occurred, if
similar situations occur in the future, they could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations, and financial condition.
Our growth and ability to meet customer demands depend in part on our ability to obtain timely
deliveries of parts from our suppliers and contract manufacturers. We have experienced component
shortages in the past, including shortages caused by manufacturing process issues, that have affected
our operations, including longer than normal lead times. For example, in recent periods, there was a
market shortage of semiconductor and other component supply which affected lead times, the cost of
that supply, and our ability to meet customer demand for our products. While supply constraints
remain, we saw an overall improvement of such constraints in fiscal 2023. Additionally, we may in the
future experience a shortage of certain component parts as a result of our own manufacturing issues,
manufacturing issues at our suppliers or contract manufacturers, capacity problems experienced by our
suppliers or contract manufacturers including capacity or cost problems resulting from industry
consolidation, or strong demand for those parts. Growth in the economy is likely to create greater
pressures on us and our suppliers to accurately project overall component demand and component
demands within specific product categories and to establish optimal component levels and
manufacturing capacity, especially for labor-intensive components, components for which we purchase a
substantial portion of the supply, or the re-ramping of manufacturing capacity for highly complex
products. During periods of shortages or delays the price of components may increase, or the
components may not be available at all, and we may also encounter shortages if we do not accurately
anticipate our needs. We may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of
acceptable quality to build new products in a timely manner in the quantities or configurations
needed. Accordingly, our revenue and gross margins could suffer until other sources can be developed.
Our operating results would also be adversely affected if, anticipating greater demand than actually
develops, we commit to the purchase of more components than we need, which is more likely to occur
during periods of demand uncertainties such as we have experienced in recent periods and expect to
continue to experience over the short- and medium-term. Although in many cases we use standard parts
and components for our products, certain components are presently available only from a single source
or limited sources, and a global economic downturn and related market uncertainty could negatively
impact the availability of components from one or more of these sources, especially during times such
as we have recently seen when there are supplier constraints based on labor and other actions taken
during economic downturns. We may not be able to diversify sources in a timely manner, which could
harm our ability to deliver products to customers and seriously impact present and future sales.
We believe that we may be faced with the following challenges in the future: new markets in which we
participate may grow quickly, which may make it difficult to quickly obtain significant component
capacity; as we acquire companies and new technologies, we may be dependent on unfamiliar supply
chains or relatively small supply partners; and we face competition for certain components that are
supply-constrained, from existing competitors, and companies in other markets.
Manufacturing capacity and component supply constraints could continue to be significant issues for
us. We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to
provide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of business, in order to
improve manufacturing lead-time performance and to help ensure adequate component supply, we enter
into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that either allow them to
 16 
Table of Contents
procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our
requirements. In certain instances, these agreements allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and
adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed. When facing
component supply-related challenges we have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to
meet customer expectations, which in turn contributes to an increase in inventory and purchase
commitments. In past periods, we increased our inventory and purchase commitments in light of the
supply constraints seen industry-wide due to component shortages. These increases in our inventory
and purchase commitments to shorten lead times could also lead to material excess and obsolete
inventory charges or other negative impacts to our product gross margin in future periods if we fail
to anticipate customer demand properly and product demand significantly weakens for a sustained
duration. For additional information and a further discussion of impacts and risks related to our
supply constraints, inventory commitments and our purchase commitments with contract manufacturers
and suppliers, see Results of Operations—Product Gross Margin—Supply Constraints Impacts and Risks,
Liquidity and Capital Resources—Inventory Supply Chain and Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.
We expect gross margin to vary over time, and our level of product gross margin may not be
sustainable.
Although our product gross margin increased in fiscal 2023, our level of product gross margins
declined in fiscal 2022 and have declined in certain prior periods on a year-over-year basis, and
could decline in future periods due to adverse impacts from various factors, including:
• Changes in customer, geographic, or product mix, including mix of configurations within each
product group
• Introduction of new products, including products with price-performance advantages, and new
business models including the transformation of our business to deliver more software and
subscription offerings
• Our ability to reduce production costs
• Entry into new markets or growth in lower margin markets, including markets with different pricing
and cost structures, through acquisitions or internal development
• Sales discounts
• Increases in material, labor or other manufacturing-related costs (i.e. component costs, broker
fees, expedited freight and overtime) or higher supply chain logistics costs, any of which could be
significant, especially during periods of supply constraints for certain costs, such as those that
have impacted the market for components, including semiconductors and memory in past periods, and
which costs have in the past and may continue to be exacerbated by inflation
• Excess inventory, inventory holding charges, and obsolescence charges
• Changes in shipment volume
• The timing of revenue recognition and revenue deferrals
• Increased costs (including those caused by tariffs or economic conditions, including inflation),
loss of cost savings or dilution of savings due to changes in component pricing or charges incurred
due to inventory holding periods if parts ordering does not correctly anticipate product demand or if
the financial health of either contract manufacturers or suppliers deteriorates
• Lower than expected benefits from value engineering
• Increased price competition, including competitors from Asia, especially from China
• Changes in distribution channels
• Increased warranty or royalty costs
• Increased amortization of purchased intangible assets, especially from acquisitions
• How well we execute on our strategy and operating plans
Changes in service gross margin may result from various factors such as changes in the mix between
technical support services and advanced services, as well as the timing of technical support service
contract initiations and renewals and the addition of personnel and other resources to support higher
levels of service business in future periods.
Sales to the service provider market are especially volatile, and weakness in orders from this
industry may harm our operating results and financial condition.
Sales to the service provider market have been characterized by large and sporadic purchases,
especially relating to our router sales and sales of certain other Secure, Agile Networks and
Collaboration products, in addition to longer sales cycles. Service provider product orders
significantly decreased during fiscal 2023 and we have experienced similar weakness in certain prior
periods. Product orders from the service provider market could continue to decline and, as has been
the case in the past, such weakness could persist over extended periods of time given fluctuating
market conditions. Sales activity in this industry
 17 
Table of Contents
depends upon the stage of completion of expanding network infrastructures; the availability of
funding; and the extent to which service providers are affected by regulatory, economic, and business
conditions in the country of operations. Weakness in orders from this industry, including as a result
of any slowdown in capital expenditures by service providers (which may be more prevalent during a
global economic downturn, or periods of economic, political or regulatory uncertainty), could have a
material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Such slowdowns
may continue or recur in future periods. Orders from this industry could decline for many reasons
other than the competitiveness of our products and services within their respective markets. For
example, in the past, many of our service provider customers have been materially and adversely
affected by slowdowns in the general economy, by overcapacity, by changes in the service provider
market, by regulatory developments, and by constraints on capital availability, resulting in business
failures and substantial reductions in spending and expansion plans. These conditions have materially
harmed our business and operating results in the past, and could affect our business and operating
results in any future period. Finally, service provider customers typically have longer
implementation cycles; require a broader range of services, including design services; demand that
vendors take on a larger share of risks; often require acceptance provisions, which can lead to a
delay in revenue recognition; and expect financing from vendors. All these factors can add further
risk to business conducted with service providers.
Disruption of or changes in our distribution model could harm our sales and margins.
If we fail to manage distribution of our products and services properly, or if our distributors’
financial condition or operations weaken, our revenue and gross margins could be adversely affected.
A substantial portion of our products and services is sold through our channel partners, and the
remainder is sold through direct sales. Our channel partners include systems integrators, service
providers, other third-party resellers, and distributors. Systems integrators and service providers
typically sell directly to end users and often provide system installation, technical support,
professional services, and other support services in addition to network equipment sales. Systems
integrators also typically integrate our products into an overall solution, and a number of service
providers are also systems integrators. Distributors stock inventory and typically sell to systems
integrators, service providers, and other third-party resellers. We refer to sales through
distributors as our two-tier system of sales to the end customer. If sales through indirect channels
increase, this may lead to greater difficulty in forecasting the mix of our products and, to a
degree, the timing of orders from our customers.
Historically, we have seen fluctuations in our gross margins based on changes in the balance of our
distribution channels. There can be no assurance that changes in the balance of our distribution
model in future periods would not have an adverse effect on our gross margins and profitability. Some
factors could result in disruption of or changes in our distribution model, which could harm our
sales and margins, including the following: competition with some of our channel partners, including
through our direct sales, which may lead these channel partners to use other suppliers that do not
directly sell their own products or otherwise compete with them; some of our channel partners may
demand that we absorb a greater share of the risks that their customers may ask them to bear; some of
our channel partners may have insufficient financial resources and may not be able to withstand
changes and challenges in business conditions; and revenue from indirect sales could suffer if our
distributors’ financial condition or operations weaken. In addition, we depend on our channel
partners globally to comply with applicable regulatory requirements. To the extent that they fail to
do so, that could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial
condition. Further, sales of our products outside of agreed territories can result in disruption to
our distribution channels.
The markets in which we compete are intensely competitive, which could adversely affect our
achievement of revenue growth.
The markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid change, converging technologies, and a
migration to networking and communications solutions that offer relative advantages. These market
factors represent a competitive threat to us. We compete with numerous vendors in each product
category. The overall number of our competitors providing niche product solutions may increase. Also,
the identity and composition of competitors may change as we increase our activity in newer product
areas, and in key priority and growth areas. For example, as products related to network
programmability, such as software defined networking (SDN) products, have become more prevalent, we
have faced increased competition from companies that develop networking products based on
commoditized hardware, referred to as “white box” hardware, to the extent customers decide to
purchase those product offerings instead of ours. In addition, the growth in demand for technology
delivered as a service enables new competitors to enter the market. As we continue to expand
globally, we may see new competition in different geographic regions. In particular, we have
experienced price-focused competition from competitors in Asia, especially from China, and we
anticipate this will continue. For information regarding our competitors, see the section entitled
“Competition” contained in Item 1. Business of this report.
Some of our competitors compete across many of our product lines, while others are primarily focused
in a specific product area. Barriers to entry are relatively low, and new ventures to create products
that do or could compete with our products are regularly formed. In addition, some of our competitors
may have greater resources, including technical and engineering resources, than we do. As we expand
into new markets, we will face competition not only from our existing competitors but
 18 
Table of Contents
also from other competitors, including existing companies with strong technological, marketing, and
sales positions in those markets. We also sometimes face competition from resellers and distributors
of our products. Companies with which we have strategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in
other areas, and this trend may increase. For example, the enterprise data center is undergoing a
fundamental transformation arising from the convergence of technologies, including computing,
networking, storage, and software, that previously were segregated. Due to several factors, including
the availability of highly scalable and general purpose microprocessors, ASICs offering advanced
services, standards based protocols, cloud computing and virtualization, the convergence of
technologies within the enterprise data center is spanning multiple, previously independent,
technology segments. Also, some of our current and potential competitors for enterprise data center
business have made acquisitions, or announced new strategic alliances, designed to position them to
provide end-to-end technology solutions for the enterprise data center. As a result of all of these
developments, we face greater competition in the development and sale of enterprise data center
technologies, including competition from entities that are among our long-term strategic alliance
partners. Companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or
form alliances with our competitors, thereby reducing their business with us.
The principal competitive factors in the markets in which we presently compete and may compete in the
future include the ability to sell successful business outcomes; the ability to provide a broad range
of networking and communications products and services; product performance; price; the ability to
introduce new products, including providing continuous new customer value and products with price-
performance advantages; the ability to reduce production costs; the ability to provide value-added
features such as security, reliability, and investment protection; conformance to standards; market
presence; the ability to provide financing; and disruptive technology shifts and new business models.
We also face competition from customers to which we license or supply technology and suppliers from
which we transfer technology. The inherent nature of networking requires interoperability. As such,
we must cooperate and at the same time compete with many companies. Any inability to effectively
manage these complicated relationships with customers, suppliers, and strategic alliance partners
could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition and
accordingly affect our chances of success.
If we do not successfully manage our strategic alliances, we may not realize the expected benefits
from such alliances, and we may experience increased competition or delays in product development.
We have several strategic alliances with large and complex organizations and other companies with
which we work to offer complementary products and services. These arrangements are generally limited
to specific projects, the goal of which is generally to facilitate product compatibility and adoption
of industry standards. There can be no assurance we will realize the expected benefits from these
strategic alliances or from joint ventures. If successful, these relationships may be mutually
beneficial and result in industry growth. However, alliances carry an element of risk because, in
most cases, we must compete in some business areas with a company with which we have a strategic
alliance and, at the same time, cooperate with that company in other business areas. Also, if these
companies fail to perform or if these relationships fail to materialize as expected, we could suffer
delays in product development or other operational difficulties. Joint ventures can be difficult to
manage, given the potentially different interests of joint venture partners.
Inventory management relating to our sales to our two-tier distribution channel is complex, and
excess inventory may harm our gross margins.
We must manage inventory relating to sales to our distributors effectively, because inventory held by
them could affect our results of operations. Our distributors may increase orders during periods of
product shortages, cancel orders if their inventory is too high, or delay orders in anticipation of
new products. They also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the
products of our competitors that are available to them, and in response to seasonal fluctuations in
end-user demand. Our distributors are generally given business terms that allow them to return a
portion of inventory, receive credits for changes in selling price, and participate in various
cooperative marketing programs. Inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need
to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory
obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements. When facing component
supply-related challenges, we have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to meet
customer expectations. If we ultimately determine that we have excess inventory, we may have to
reduce our prices and write down inventory, which in turn could result in lower gross margins.
We depend upon the development of new products and services, and enhancements to existing products
and services, and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers’
changing needs, our operating results and market share may suffer.
The markets for our products and services are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving
industry standards, new product and service introductions, and evolving methods of building and
operating networks. Our operating results depend on
 19 
Table of Contents
our ability to develop and introduce new products and services into existing and emerging markets and
to reduce the production costs of existing products. If customers do not purchase and/or renew our
offerings our business could be harmed.
The process of developing new technology, including more programmable, flexible and virtual networks,
and technology related to other market transitions— such as security, digital transformation and IoT,
and cloud— is complex and uncertain, and if we fail to accurately predict customers’ changing needs
and emerging technological trends our business could be harmed. We must commit significant resources,
including the investments we have been making in our strategic priorities to developing new products
and services before knowing whether our investments will result in products and services the market
will accept. In particular, if our model of the evolution of networking does not emerge as we believe
it will, or if the industry does not evolve as we believe it will, or if our strategy for addressing
this evolution is not successful, many of our strategic initiatives and investments may be of no or
limited value. For example, if we do not introduce products related to network programmability, such
as software-defined-networking products, in a timely fashion, or if product offerings in this market
that ultimately succeed are based on technology, or an approach to technology, that differs from
ours, such as, for example, networking products based on “white box” hardware, our business could be
harmed. Similarly, our business could be harmed if we fail to develop, or fail to develop in a timely
fashion, offerings to address other transitions, or if the offerings addressing these other
transitions that ultimately succeed are based on technology, or an approach to technology, different
from ours. In addition, our business could be adversely affected in periods surrounding our new
product introductions if customers delay purchasing decisions to qualify or otherwise evaluate the
new product offerings. We have also been transforming our business to move from selling individual
products and services to selling products and services integrated into architectures and solutions,
and we are seeking to meet the evolving needs of customers which include offering our products and
solutions in the manner in which customers wish to consume them. As a part of this transformation, we
continue to make changes to how we are organized and how we build and deliver our technology,
including changes in our business models with customers. If our strategy for addressing our customer
needs, or the architectures and solutions we develop do not meet those needs, or the changes we are
making in how we are organized and how we build and deliver or technology is incorrect or
ineffective, our business could be harmed.
Furthermore, we may not execute successfully on our vision or strategy because of challenges with
regard to product planning and timing, technical hurdles that we fail to overcome in a timely
fashion, or a lack of appropriate resources. This could result in competitors, some of which may also
be our strategic alliance partners, providing those solutions before we do and loss of market share,
revenue, and earnings. In addition, the growth in demand for technology delivered as a service
enables new competitors to enter the market. The success of new products and services depends on
several factors, including proper new product and service definition, component costs, timely
completion and introduction of these products and services, differentiation of new products and
services from those of our competitors, and market acceptance of these products and services. There
can be no assurance that we will successfully identify new product and services opportunities,
develop and bring new products and services to market in a timely manner, or achieve market
acceptance of our products and services or that products, services and technologies developed by
others will not render our products, services or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive. The
products and technologies in our other product categories and key priority and growth areas may not
prove to have the market success we anticipate, and we may not successfully identify and invest in
other emerging or new products and services.
Changes in industry structure and market conditions could lead to charges related to discontinuances
of certain of our products or businesses, asset impairments and workforce reductions or
restructurings.
In response to changes in industry and market conditions, we may be required to strategically realign
our resources and to consider restructuring, disposing of, or otherwise exiting businesses. Any
resource realignment, or decision to limit investment in or dispose of or otherwise exit businesses,
may result in the recording of special charges, such as inventory and technology-related write-offs,
workforce reduction or restructuring costs, charges relating to consolidation of excess facilities,
or claims from third parties who were resellers or users of discontinued products. Our estimates with
respect to the useful life or ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis of assets, including
purchased intangible assets, could change as a result of such assessments and decisions. Although in
certain instances our supply agreements allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our
requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed, our loss contingencies
may include liabilities for contracts that we cannot cancel with contract manufacturers and
suppliers. Further, our estimates relating to the liabilities for excess facilities are affected by
changes in real estate market conditions. Additionally, we are required to perform goodwill
impairment tests on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances, and future
goodwill impairment tests may result in a charge to earnings. We initiated a restructuring plan in
the second quarter of fiscal 2023, for which we expect such plan to be substantially completed by the
end of the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Our business may not be more efficient or effective than
prior to implementation of the plan. Our restructuring activities, including any related charges and
the impact of the related headcount restructurings, could have a material adverse effect on our
business, operating results, and financial condition.

Over the long term we intend to invest in engineering, sales, service and marketing activities, and
in key priority and growth areas, and these investments may achieve delayed, or lower than expected,
benefits which could harm our operating results.
While we intend to focus on managing our costs and expenses, over the long term, we also intend to
invest in personnel and other resources related to our engineering, sales, service and marketing
functions as we realign and dedicate resources on key priority and growth areas. We also intend to
focus on maintaining leadership in core networking and services. We are likely to recognize the costs
associated with these investments earlier than some of the anticipated benefits, and the return on
these investments may be lower, or may develop more slowly, than we expect. If we do not achieve the
benefits anticipated from these investments (including if our selection of areas for investment does
not play out as we expect), or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed, our operating results
may be adversely affected.
We have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions that could disrupt our operations and harm
our operating results.
Our growth depends upon market growth, our ability to enhance our existing products, and our ability
to introduce new products on a timely basis. We intend to continue to address the need to develop new
products and enhance existing products through acquisitions of other companies, product lines,
technologies, and personnel. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following:
• Difficulties or delays in integrating the operations (including IT security), systems,
technologies, products, and personnel of the acquired companies, particularly with companies that
have large and widespread operations and/or complex products
• Diversion of management’s attention from normal daily operations of the business and the challenges
of managing larger and more widespread operations resulting from acquisitions
• Potential difficulties in completing projects associated with in-process research and development
intangibles
• Difficulties in entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where
competitors in such markets have stronger market positions
• Initial dependence on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners
• Insufficient revenue to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions
• The potential loss of key employees, customers, distributors, vendors and other business partners
of the companies we acquire following and continuing after announcement of acquisition plans
Acquisitions may also cause us to:
• Issue common stock that would dilute our current stockholders’ percentage ownership
• Use a substantial portion of our cash resources, or incur debt
• Significantly increase our interest expense, leverage and debt service requirements if we incur
additional debt to pay for an acquisition
• Assume liabilities
• Record goodwill and intangible assets that are subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and
potential periodic impairment charges
• Incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets
• Incur tax expenses related to the effect of acquisitions on our legal structure
• Incur large write-offs and restructuring and other related expenses
• Become subject to intellectual property or other litigation
Mergers and acquisitions of high-technology companies are inherently risky and subject to many
factors outside of our control, and no assurance can be given that our previous or future
acquisitions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business, operating
results, or financial condition. Failure to manage and successfully integrate acquisitions could
materially harm our business and operating results. Prior acquisitions have resulted in a wide range
of outcomes, from successful introduction of new products and technologies to a failure to do so.
Even when an acquired company has already developed and marketed products, there can be no assurance
that product enhancements will be made in a timely fashion or that pre-acquisition due diligence will
have identified all possible issues that might arise with respect to such products. In addition, our
effective tax rate for future periods is uncertain and could be impacted by mergers and acquisitions.
Risks related to new product development also apply to acquisitions.

Entrance into new or developing markets exposes us to additional competition and will likely increase
demands on our service and support operations.
As we focus on new market opportunities and key priority and growth areas, we compete with large
telecommunications and other equipment suppliers as well as startup companies. Several of our
competitors may have greater resources, including technical and engineering resources, than we do.
Additionally, as customers in these markets complete infrastructure deployments, they may require
greater levels of service, support, and financing than we have provided in the past, especially in
emerging countries. Demand for these types of service, support, or financing contracts may increase
in the future. There can be no assurance that we can provide products, service, support, and
financing to effectively compete for these market opportunities. Further, entry into other markets
has subjected and will subject us to additional risks, particularly to those markets, including the
effects of general market conditions and reduced consumer confidence. For example, as we add direct
selling capabilities globally to meet changing customer demands, we will face increased legal and
regulatory requirements.
Product quality problems could lead to reduced revenue, gross margins, and net income.
We produce highly complex products that incorporate leading-edge technology, including both hardware
and software. Software typically contains bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with expected
operations. There can be no assurance that our pre-shipment testing programs will be adequate to
detect all defects, either ones in individual products or ones that could affect numerous shipments,
which might interfere with customer satisfaction, reduce sales opportunities, or affect gross
margins. From time to time, we have had to replace certain components and provide remediation in
response to the discovery of defects or bugs in products that we had shipped. There can be no
assurance that such remediation, depending on the product involved, would not have a material impact.
An inability to cure a product defect could result in the failure of a product line, temporary or
permanent withdrawal from a product or market, damage to our reputation, inventory costs, or product
reengineering expenses, any of which could have a material impact on our revenue, margins, and net
income.
Due to the global nature of our operations, political or economic changes or other factors in a
specific country or region could harm our operating results and financial condition.
We conduct significant sales and customer support operations in countries around the world. As such,
our growth depends in part on our increasing sales into emerging countries. We also depend on
non-U.S. operations of our contract manufacturers, component suppliers and distribution partners. Our
business in emerging countries in the aggregate experienced a decline in orders in certain prior
periods. We continue to assess the sustainability of any improvements in our business in these
countries and there can be no assurance that our investments in these countries will be successful.
Our future results could be materially adversely affected by a variety of political, economic or
other factors relating to our operations inside and outside the United States, any or all of which
could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition, including the
following: impacts from global central bank monetary policy; issues related to the political
relationship between the United States and other countries that can affect regulatory matters, affect
the willingness of customers in those countries to purchase products from companies headquartered in
the United States or affect our ability to procure components if a government body were to deny us
access to those components; government-related disruptions or shutdowns; the challenging and
inconsistent global macroeconomic environment; foreign currency exchange rates; geopolitical tensions
(including China-Taiwan relations); political or social unrest; economic instability or weakness or
natural disasters in a specific country or region, including economic challenges in China and global
economic ramifications of Chinese economic difficulties; environmental protection regulations
(including new laws and regulations related to climate change); trade protection measures such as
tariffs, and other legal and regulatory requirements, some of which may affect our ability to import
our products to, export our products from, or sell our products in various countries or affect our
ability to procure components; political considerations that affect service provider and government
spending patterns; health or similar issues, including pandemics or epidemics; difficulties in
staffing and managing international operations; and adverse tax consequences, including imposition of
withholding or other taxes on our global operations.
Issues related to the development and use of artificial intelligence (AI) could give rise to legal
and/or regulatory action, damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm of our business.
We currently incorporate AI technology in certain of our products and services and in our business
operations. Our research and development of such technology remains ongoing. AI presents risks,
challenges, and unintended consequences that could affect our and our customers’ adoption and use of
this technology. AI algorithms and training methodologies may be flawed. Additionally, AI
technologies are complex and rapidly evolving, and we face significant competition in the market and
from other companies regarding such technologies. While we aim to develop and use AI responsibly and
attempt to identify and mitigate ethical and legal issues presented by its use, we may be
unsuccessful in identifying or resolving issues before they arise. AI-related issues, deficiencies
and/or failures could (i) give rise to legal and/or regulatory action, including with respect to
proposed legislation regulating AI in jurisdictions such as the European Union and others, and as a
result of new applications of
 22 
Table of Contents
existing data protection, privacy, intellectual property, and other laws; (ii) damage our reputation;
or (iii) otherwise materially harm our business.
We are exposed to the credit risk of some of our customers and to credit exposures in weakened
markets, which could result in material losses.
Most of our sales are on an open credit basis, with typical payment terms of 30 days in the United
States, and, because of local customs or conditions, longer in some markets outside the United
States. Beyond our open credit arrangements, we have also experienced demands for customer financing
and facilitation of leasing arrangements. Our loan financing arrangements may include not only
financing the acquisition of our products and services but also providing additional funds for other
costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services. Our exposure
to the credit risks relating to our financing activities may increase if our customers are adversely
affected by a global economic downturn or periods of economic uncertainty. There can be no assurance
that programs we have in place to monitor and mitigate credit risks will be effective. In the past,
there have been significant bankruptcies among customers both on open credit and with loan or lease
financing arrangements, particularly among Internet businesses and service providers, causing us to
incur economic or financial losses. There can be no assurance that additional losses will not be
incurred. Although these losses have not been material to date, future losses, if incurred, could
harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial
condition. Additionally, to the degree that turmoil in the credit markets makes it more difficult for
some customers to obtain financing, those customers’ ability to pay could be adversely impacted,
which in turn could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial
condition.
We are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest
rates; impairment of our investments could harm our earnings.
We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. Our portfolio
includes available-for-sale debt investments and equity investments, the values of which are subject
to market price volatility. If such investments suffer market price declines, as we experienced with
some of our investments in the past, we may recognize in earnings the decline in the fair value of
our investments below their cost basis. Our privately held investments are subject to risk of loss of
investment capital. These investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies
or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize.
We could lose our entire investment in these companies. For information regarding the market risks
associated with the fair value of portfolio investments and interest rates, refer to the section
titled “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”
We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial
results and cash flows.
Because a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the United States, we face
exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates, including emerging market
currencies which can have extreme currency volatility. An increase in the value of the dollar could
increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the United States
where we sell in dollars and a weakened dollar could increase the cost of local operating expenses
and procurement of raw materials to the extent that we must purchase components in foreign
currencies. These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve, and they could have a
material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows.
Failure to retain and recruit key personnel would harm our ability to meet key objectives.
Our success has always depended in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled
technical, managerial, sales, and marketing personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense,
especially in the Silicon Valley area of Northern California and other major United States locations.
Stock incentive plans are designed to reward employees for their long-term contributions and provide
incentives for them to remain with us. Volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price
or equity incentive awards, or changes to our overall compensation program, including our stock
incentive program, resulting from the management of share dilution and share-based compensation
expense or otherwise, may also adversely affect our ability to retain key employees. As a result of
one or more of these factors, we may increase our hiring in geographic areas outside the United
States, which could subject us to additional geopolitical and exchange rate risk. The loss of
services of any of our key personnel; the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the
future; or delays in hiring required personnel, particularly in engineering and sales fields, could
make it difficult to meet key objectives, such as timely and effective product introductions. In
addition, companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently
claim that competitors have engaged in improper hiring practices. We have received these claims in
the past and may receive additional claims to this effect in the future.
Adverse resolution of litigation or governmental investigations may harm our operating results or
financial condition.
We are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business. Additionally, in connection with the
Russia and Ukraine war and our decision to stop business operations and orderly wind down our
business in Russia, there are existing claims and lawsuits in Russia, and the potential for future
claims and lawsuits in Russia and/or Belarus, related to such decision and related
 23 
Table of Contents
trade restrictions and sanctions. In the event of an unfavorable resolution of any of these lawsuits,
the potential outcome could include the seizure of our assets in Russia and/or Belarus, which,
collectively, represents less than 0.1% of our total assets at the end of fiscal 2023. Litigation can
be costly, lengthy, and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results of complex
legal proceedings are difficult to predict. An unfavorable resolution of lawsuits or governmental
investigations could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial
condition. For additional information regarding certain of the matters in which we are involved, see
Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, subsection (f) “Legal Proceedings.”
Our operating results may be adversely affected and damage to our reputation may occur due to
production and sale of counterfeit versions of our products.
As is the case with leading products around the world, our products are subject to efforts by third
parties to produce counterfeit versions of our products. While we work diligently with law
enforcement authorities in various countries to block the manufacture of counterfeit goods and to
interdict their sale, and to detect counterfeit products in customer networks, and have succeeded in
prosecuting counterfeiters and their distributors, resulting in fines, imprisonment and restitution
to us, there can be no guarantee that such efforts will succeed. While counterfeiters often aim their
sales at customers who might not have otherwise purchased our products due to lack of verifiability
of origin and service, such counterfeit sales, to the extent they replace otherwise legitimate sales,
could adversely affect our operating results.
Changes in our provision for income taxes or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our
income tax returns could adversely affect our results.
Our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by earnings
being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in
countries that have higher tax rates; by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and
liabilities; by changes to foreign-derived intangible income, global intangible low-tax income and
base erosion and anti-abuse tax laws, regulations, or interpretations thereof; by expiration of or
lapses in tax incentives; by transfer pricing adjustments, including the effect of acquisitions on
our legal structure; by tax effects of nondeductible compensation; by tax costs related to
intercompany realignments; by changes in accounting principles; or by changes in tax laws and
regulations, treaties, or interpretations thereof, including changes to the taxation of earnings of
our foreign subsidiaries, the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income, and the
foreign tax credit rules. Significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and
measurement attribute prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes. The
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), an international association comprised
of 38 countries, including the United States, has made changes and is contemplating additional
changes to numerous long-standing tax principles. There can be no assurance that these changes and
any contemplated changes if finalized, once adopted by countries, will not have an adverse impact on
our provision for income taxes. Further, as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital
investment actions and commitments, our income in certain countries was subject to reduced tax rates.
Our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes. In
addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse
outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income
taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have
an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.
Our business and operations are especially subject to the risks of earthquakes, floods, and other
natural catastrophic events (including as a result of global climate change).
Our corporate headquarters, including certain of our research and development operations are located
in the Silicon Valley area of Northern California, a region known for seismic activity. Additionally,
a certain number of our facilities are located near rivers that have experienced flooding in the
past. Also certain of our customers, suppliers and logistics centers are located in regions that have
been or may be affected by earthquake, tsunami and flooding or other weather-related activity which
in the past has disrupted, and in the future could disrupt, the flow of supply chain components and
delivery of products. In addition, global climate change may result in significant natural disasters
occurring more frequently and/or with greater intensity, such as drought, wildfires, storms, sea-
level rise, changing precipitation, and flooding. We have not to date experienced a material event as
a result of these kinds of natural disasters; however, the occurrence of any such event in the future
could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
Terrorism, war, and other events may harm our business, operating results and financial condition.
The continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response thereto, or
any other current or future acts of terrorism, war (such as the on-going Russia and Ukraine war), and
other events (such as economic sanctions and trade restrictions, including those related to the on-
going Russia and Ukraine war) may cause further disruptions to the economies of the United States and
other countries and create further uncertainties or could otherwise negatively impact our business,
operating results, and financial condition. Likewise, events such as loss of infrastructure and
utilities services such as energy,
 24 
Table of Contents
transportation, or telecommunications could have similar negative impacts. To the extent that such
disruptions or uncertainties result in delays or cancellations of customer orders or the manufacture
or shipment of our products, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be
materially and adversely affected.
There can be no assurance that our operating results and financial condition will not be adversely
affected by our incurrence of debt.
As of the end of fiscal 2023, we have senior unsecured notes outstanding in an aggregate principal
amount of $8.5 billion that mature at specific dates from calendar year 2023 through 2040. We have
also established a commercial paper program under which we may issue short-term, unsecured commercial
paper notes on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of
$10.0 billion. We had no commercial paper notes outstanding under this program as of July 29, 2023 .
There can be no assurance that our incurrence of this debt or any future debt will be a better means
of providing liquidity to us than would our use of our existing cash resources. Further, we cannot be
assured that our maintenance of this indebtedness or incurrence of future indebtedness will not
adversely affect our operating results or financial condition. In addition, changes by any rating
agency to our credit rating can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity
securities, as well as the terms upon which we may borrow under our commercial paper program or
future debt issuances.
Our reputation and/or business could be negatively impacted by ESG matters and/or our reporting of
such matters.
There is an increasing focus from regulators, certain investors, and other stakeholders concerning
environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) matters, both in the United States and internationally.
We communicate certain ESG-related initiatives, goals, and/or commitments regarding environmental
matters, diversity and inclusion, responsible sourcing and social investments, and other matters, in
our annual Purpose Report, on our website, in our filings with the SEC, and elsewhere. These
initiatives, goals, or commitments could be difficult to achieve and costly to implement. For
example, in September 2021, we announced our goal to achieve net zero across all scopes of greenhouse
gas emissions by 2040, the achievement of which relies, in large part, on the accuracy of our
estimates and assumptions around the enhanced power efficiency of our products, the adoption of
renewable energy at customer and supplier sites, and the adoption of certain of our products and
services by our customers. We could fail to achieve, or be perceived to fail to achieve, our 2040 net
zero goal or other ESG-related initiatives, goals, or commitments. In addition, we could be
criticized for the timing, scope or nature of these initiatives, goals, or commitments, or for any
revisions to them. To the extent that our required and voluntary disclosures about ESG matters
increase, we could be criticized for the accuracy, adequacy, or completeness of such disclosures. Our
actual or perceived failure to achieve our ESG-related initiatives, goals, or commitments could
negatively impact our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business.
 Risks Related to Intellectual Property 
Our proprietary rights may prove difficult to enforce.
We generally rely on patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secret laws to establish and maintain
proprietary rights in our technology and products. Although we have been issued numerous patents and
other patent applications are currently pending, there can be no assurance that any of these patents
or other proprietary rights will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented or that our rights
will, in fact, provide competitive advantages to us. Furthermore, many key aspects of networking
technology are governed by industrywide standards, which are usable by all market entrants. In
addition, there can be no assurance that patents will be issued from pending applications or that
claims allowed on any patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. In addition, the
laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the
laws of the United States. The outcome of any actions taken in these foreign countries may be
different than if such actions were determined under the laws of the United States. Although we are
not dependent on any individual patents or group of patents for particular segments of the business
for which we compete, if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights to the totality of the
features (including aspects of products protected other than by patent rights) in a market, we may
find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the substantial expense,
time, and effort required to create innovative products that have enabled us to be successful.
We may be found to infringe on intellectual property rights of others.
Third parties, including customers, have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate
litigation related to exclusive patent, copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property rights
to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us. These assertions have increased over
time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims assertions,
particularly in the United States. Because of the existence of a large number of patents in the
networking field, the secrecy of some pending patents, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents,
it is not economically practical or even possible to determine in advance whether a product or any of
its components infringes or will infringe on the patent rights of others. The asserted claims and/or
initiated litigation can include claims against us or our manufacturers, suppliers, or customers,
alleging
 25 
Table of Contents
infringement of their proprietary rights with respect to our existing or future products or
components of those products. Regardless of the merit of these claims, they can be time-consuming,
result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel, or require us to
develop a non-infringing technology or enter into license agreements. Where claims are made by
customers, resistance even to unmeritorious claims could damage customer relationships. There can be
no assurance that licenses will be available on acceptable terms and conditions, if at all, or that
our indemnification by our suppliers will be adequate to cover our costs if a claim were brought
directly against us or our customers. Furthermore, because of the potential for high court awards
that are not necessarily predictable, it is not unusual to find even arguably unmeritorious claims
settled for significant amounts. If any infringement or other intellectual property claim made
against us by any third party is successful, if we are required to indemnify a customer with respect
to a claim against the customer, or if we fail to develop non-infringing technology or license the
proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions, our business, operating results,
and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. For additional information
regarding our indemnification obligations, see Note 14(e) to the Consolidated Financial Statements
contained in this report. Our exposure to risks associated with the use of intellectual property may
be increased as a result of acquisitions, as we have a lower level of visibility into the development
process with respect to such technology or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks.
Further, in the past, third parties have made infringement and similar claims after we have acquired
technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition.
We rely on the availability of third-party licenses.
Many of our products are designed to include software or other intellectual property licensed from
third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various
aspects of these products. There can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available
on acceptable terms, if at all. The inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain
such licenses or rights on favorable terms, or the need to engage in litigation regarding these
matters, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial
condition. Moreover, the inclusion in our products of software or other intellectual property
licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis could limit our ability to protect our
proprietary rights in our products.
Risks Related to Cybersecurity, Privacy, and Regulatory Requirements
Cyber attacks, data breaches or other incidents may disrupt our operations, harm our operating
results and financial condition, and damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business;
and cyber attacks, data breaches or other incidents on our customers’ or third-party providers’
networks, or in cloud-based services provided to, by, or enabled by us, could result in claims of
liability against us, give rise to legal and/or regulatory action, damage our reputation or otherwise
materially harm our business.
We experience cyber attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to our products, services,
and IT environment on a regular basis, and we anticipate continuing to be subject to such attempts as
cyber attacks become increasingly sophisticated and more difficult to predict and protect against.
Despite our implementation of security measures, (i) our products and services, and (ii) the servers,
data centers, and cloud-based solutions on which our and third-party data is stored or processed
(including servers, data centers and cloud-based solutions operated by third parties on which we
rely) (collectively, our “IT environment”), are vulnerable to cyber attacks, data breaches, malware,
inadvertent error, disruptions, tampering or other theft or misuse, including by employees,
contingent workers, malicious actors, or nation-states or their agents (which cyber attack or related
activity may intensify during periods of diplomatic or armed conflict). Further, a cyber attack or
other incident could go undetected and persist in our environments for extended periods. Cyber-
related events have caused, and in the future could result in, compromise to, or the disruption of
access to, the operation of our products, services, and IT environment or those of our customers or
third-party providers we rely on, or result in confidential information stored on our systems, our
customers’ systems, or other third-party systems being improperly accessed, processed, disclosed now
or in the future, or be lost or stolen. For example, in December 2021, multiple vulnerabilities were
reported for the widely used Java logging library, Apache Log4j. We reviewed the use of this library
within our products and services, its use in our enterprise IT environment, and its use by our third-
party providers, and have taken steps to mitigate these vulnerabilities, including by providing
security updates for affected products to our customers. We have not to date experienced a material
event related to a cybersecurity matter; however, the occurrence of any such event in the future
could subject us to liability to our customers, data subjects, suppliers, business partners,
employees, and others, give rise to legal and/or regulatory action, could damage our reputation or
could otherwise materially harm our business, any of which could have a material adverse effect on
our business, operating results, and financial condition. Efforts to limit the ability of malicious
actors to disrupt the operations of the Internet or undermine our own security efforts are costly to
implement and may not be successful. Breaches of security in our customers’ or third-party providers’
networks, in third-party products we use, or in cloud-based services provided to, by, or enabled by
us, regardless of whether the breach is attributable to a vulnerability in our products or services,
or a failure to maintain the digital security infrastructure or security tools that protect the
integrity of our products, services, and IT environment, could, in each case, result in claims of
liability against us, damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business.

Vulnerabilities and critical security defects, prioritization decisions regarding remedying
vulnerabilities or security defects, failure of third-party providers to remedy vulnerabilities or
security defects, or customers not deploying security updates in a timely manner or deciding not to
upgrade products, services or solutions could result in claims of liability against us, damage our
reputation, or otherwise materially harm our business.
The products and services we sell to customers, and our cloud-based solutions, inevitably contain
vulnerabilities or security defects which have not been remedied and cannot be disclosed without
compromising security. We also make prioritization decisions in determining which vulnerabilities or
security defects to fix and the timing of these fixes. Customers may also need to test security
updates before they can be deployed which can delay implementation. When customers do not deploy
security updates in a timely manner, or decide not to upgrade to the latest versions of our products,
services or cloud-based solutions containing the security update, they may be left vulnerable. In
addition, we rely on third-party providers of software and cloud-based services on which our and
third-party data is stored or processed, and we cannot control the timing at which third-party
providers remedy vulnerabilities, which could leave us vulnerable. Vulnerabilities and security
defects, prioritization errors in remedying vulnerabilities or security defects, failure of third-
party providers to remedy vulnerabilities or security defects, or customers not deploying security
updates in a timely manner or deciding not to upgrade products, services or solutions could result in
claims of liability against us, damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business.
Our actual or perceived failure to adequately protect personal data could result in claims of
liability against us, damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business.
Global privacy and data protection-related laws and regulations are evolving, extensive, and complex.
Compliance with these laws and regulations is difficult and costly. In addition, evolving legal
requirements restricting or controlling the collection, processing, or cross-border transmission of
data, including for regulation of cloud-based services, could materially affect our customers’
ability to use, and our ability to sell, our products and services. The interpretation and
application of these laws in some instances is uncertain, and our legal and regulatory obligations
are subject to frequent changes. For example, the European Union’s (“EU”) General Data Protection
Regulation (“GDPR”) applies to our activities conducted from an establishment in the EU or related to
products and services offered in the EU and imposes a range of compliance obligations regarding the
handling of personal data. Additionally, we are subject to California’s Consumer Privacy Act and
other laws, regulations and obligations that relate to the handling of personal data. Our actual or
perceived failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or other obligations relating to
personal data, or to protect personal data from unauthorized access, use, or other processing, could
subject us to liability to our customers, data subjects, suppliers, business partners, employees, and
others, give rise to legal and/or regulatory action, could damage our reputation or could otherwise
materially harm our business, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
operating results, and financial condition.
Our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially harmed by evolving
regulatory uncertainty or obligations applicable to our products and services.
Changes in regulatory requirements applicable to the industries and sectors in which we operate, in
the United States and in other countries, could materially affect the sales of our products and
services. In particular, economic sanctions and changes to export and import control requirements
have impacted and may continue to impact our ability to sell and support our products and services in
certain jurisdictions. In addition, changes in telecommunications regulations could impact our
service provider customers’ purchase of our products and services, and they could also impact sales
of our own regulated offerings. Additional areas of uncertainty that could impact sales of our
products and services include laws, regulations, or customer procurement requirements related to
encryption technology, data, artificial intelligence, privacy, cybersecurity, environmental
sustainability (including climate change), human rights, product certification, product
accessibility, country of origin, and national security controls applicable to our supply chain.
Changes in regulatory requirements in any of these areas or our actual or perceived failure to comply
with applicable laws and regulations or other obligations relating to these areas could have a
material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
 Risks Related to Ownership of Our Stock 
 Our stock price may be volatile. 
Historically, our common stock has experienced substantial price volatility, particularly as a result
of variations between our actual financial results and the published expectations of analysts and as
a result of announcements by our competitors and us. Furthermore, speculation in the press or
investment community about our strategic position, financial condition, results of operations,
business, security of our products, or significant transactions can cause changes in our stock price.
In addition, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have
affected the market price of many technology companies, in particular, and that have often been
unrelated to the operating performance of these companies. These factors, as well as general economic
and political conditions and the announcement of proposed and completed acquisitions or other
significant transactions, or any difficulties associated with such transactions, by us or our current
or potential competitors, may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock in the
future. Additionally, volatility, lack of positive
 27

performance in our stock price or changes to our overall compensation program, including our stock
incentive program, may adversely affect our ability to retain key employees, virtually all of whom
are compensated, in part, based on the performance of our stock price.
