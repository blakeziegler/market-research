to a collective bargaining agreement.
Additionally, in 2024 and 2023, the Corporation’s
compensation and benefits expense was $40.2
billion and $38.3 billion, or 60 percent and 58
percent, of total noninterest expense. The

Talent, Inclusion and Opportunity The Corporation is focused on building a strong pipeline of talent,
which means finding and hiring external candidates who are committed to our purpose and have a
passion for serving our clients and communities. This spans programs from entry-level hiring through
more senior-level recruiting. In 2024, the Corporation hired over 18,000 teammates reflecting a wide
variety of backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives so that we understand and can respond to the
needs of our clients and communities. We provide a variety of resources to help employees grow in
their current roles and build new skills, including resources to help employees find new
opportunities, re-skill and seek leadership positions. We have 11 Employee Networks with over 320,000
voluntary memberships, which provide teammates opportunities to meet new people, have an impact
across multiple business lines and grow personally and professionally. They are open to all employees
and participation is voluntary. In 2024, more than 12,000 employees found new roles within the
Corporation, and we delivered approximately 7.6 million hours of training and development to our
teammates through Bank of America Academy. Additionally, our Board oversees Chief Executive Officer
and senior management succession planning, which is formally reviewed at least annually. As part of
our ongoing efforts to make the Corporation a great place to work, we conduct a confidential annual
Employee Engagement Survey (Survey) and have done so for nearly two decades. The Survey results are
reviewed by the Board and senior management and used to assist in reviewing the Corporation’s human
capital strategies, programs, initiatives, and practices. In 2024, 87 percent of the Corporation’s
employees participated in the Survey, and our Employee Engagement Index, an overall measure of
employee satisfaction with the Corporation, was 84 percent. Our turnover among employees was stable
at 8 percent in both 2024 and 2023.
Recognizing and Rewarding Performance Our compensation philosophy is to pay for performance over the
long term, as well as on an annual basis. Our performance considerations encompass both financial and
nonfinancial measures, including the manner in which results are achieved. These considerations are
designed to reinforce and promote Responsible Growth and align with our Risk Framework. We strive to
pay our employees based on market rates for their roles, experience and how they perform. We
regularly benchmark against other companies both within and outside our industry to confirm our pay
is competitive. In 2021, the Corporation announced it would increase its minimum hourly wage for U.S.
employees to $25 per hour by 2025. In October 2024, as a next step towards that goal, the Corporation
increased its hourly minimum wage for U.S. employees to $24 per hour. In addition, in January 2025,
for the eighth year since 2017, we announced that we recognized our teammates with Sharing Success
compensation awards for their efforts during 2024. Approximately 97 percent of employees globally
will receive an award in the first quarter of 2025. The Corporation is committed to equal pay for
equal work. We maintain robust policies and practices that reinforce our commitment, including
reviews conducted by a third-party consultant with oversight from our Board and senior management.
Physical, Emotional, and Financial Wellness The Corporation is committed to providing employees with
access to leading benefits and programs that help promote their physical, emotional and financial
wellness. Investments we make in our teammates are designed to help them thrive, enabling them to
better deliver for our clients, communities and each other. In 2024, we continued our efforts to
provide affordable access to healthcare. Teammates enrolled in one of our national medical plans were
able to access virtual general medical and behavioral health care at no cost. For the 12th year in a
row, U.S. health insurance premiums remained unchanged for teammates earning less than $50,000. We
also recognize the importance of emotional wellness. Globally, teammates and members of their
households can utilize our Employee Assistance Programs for 12 in-person confidential counseling
sessions, and unlimited phone consultations at no cost. The Corporation also offers comprehensive
time-away policies and caregiving benefits. Globally, teammates celebrating at least 15 years of
continuous service with the Corporation can participate in our paid Global Sabbatical Program. We
support teammates in reaching financial wellness with retirement savings plans and other programs,
along with access to self-guided financial planning tools and expert advice. For more information
about our human capital management, see the Corporation’s website and 2024 Annual Report to
shareholders that we expect to be available on the Investor Relations portion of our website in March
2025 (the content of which is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K).
Government Supervision and Regulation The following discussion describes, among other things,
elements of an extensive regulatory framework applicable to BHCs, financial holding companies, banks
and broker-dealers, including specific information about Bank of America.
 3Bank of America 
We are subject to an extensive regulatory
framework applicable to BHCs, financial holding
companies and banks and other financial services
entities. U.S. federal regulation of banks, BHCs
and financial holding companies is intended
primarily for the protection of depositors and
the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) rather than for
the protection of shareholders and creditors. As
a registered financial holding company and BHC,
the Corporation is subject to the supervision of,
and regular inspection by, the Board of Governors
of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve).
Our U.S. bank subsidiaries (the Banks), organized
as national banking associations, are subject to
regulation, supervision and examination by the
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC),
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)
and the Federal Reserve. In addition, the Federal
Reserve and the OCC have adopted guidelines that
establish minimum standards for the design,
implementation and board oversight of BHCs’ and
national banks’ risk governance frameworks. U.S.
financial holding companies, and the companies
under their control, are permitted to engage in
activities considered “financial in nature” as
defined by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and related
Federal Reserve interpretations. The
Corporation's status as a financial holding
company is conditioned upon maintaining certain
eligibility requirements for both the Corporation
and its U.S. depository institution subsidiaries,
including minimum capital ratios, supervisory
ratings and, in the case of the depository
institutions, at least satisfactory Community
Reinvestment Act ratings. Failure to be an
eligible financial holding company could result
in the Federal Reserve limiting Bank of America's
activities, including potential acquisitions.
Additionally, we are subject to a significant
number of laws, rules and regulations (LRRs) that
govern our businesses in the U.S. and in the
other jurisdictions in which we operate,
including permissible activities, minimum levels
of capital and liquidity, compliance risk
management, consumer products and sales
practices, privacy, data protection,
sustainability and executive compensation, among
others.
The scope of the LRRs and the intensity of the
supervision to which we are subject have
continuously increased over the years. In
addition, the banking and financial services
sector is subject to substantial regulatory
enforcement and fines. We cannot assess whether
or not there will be any major changes in the
regulatory environment and expect that our
business will remain subject to continuing and
extensive regulation and supervision.
We are also subject to various other LRRs, as
well as supervision and examination by other
regulatory agencies, all of which directly or
indirectly affect our entities, management and
ability to make distributions to shareholders.
For instance, our broker-dealer subsidiaries are
subject to both U.S. and international
regulation, including supervision by the SEC,
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and New
York Stock Exchange, among others; our futures
commission merchant subsidiary supporting
commodities and derivatives businesses in the
U.S. is subject to regulation by and supervision
of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission
(CFTC), National Futures Association, the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, and in the case of the
Banks, certain banking regulators; our insurance
activities are subject to licensing and
regulation by state insurance regulatory
agencies; and our consumer financial products and
services are regulated by the Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau (CFPB). In addition, certain
U.S. and foreign subsidiaries are also registered
with the CFTC as swap dealers, and conditionally
registered with the SEC as security-based swap
dealers.
Our non-U.S. businesses are also subject to
extensive regulation by various non-U.S.
regulators, including governments, securities
exchanges, prudential regulators, central banks
and other regulatory bodies, in the jurisdictions
in which those businesses operate. For example,
our financial services entities are subject to
regulation in the United Kingdom (U.K.) by the
Prudential Regulatory Authority and Financial
Conduct Authority, in Ireland by the European
Central Bank (ECB) and the Central Bank of
Ireland and in France by the ECB, Autorité de
Contrôle Prudentiel et de Résolution and Autorité
des Marchés Financiers.
The Corporation is also subject to extensive LRRs
in the U.S. and in the other jurisdictions in
which it operates regarding bribery and
corruption, know-your-customer requirements,
anti-money laundering, embargo programs and
economic sanctions. For example, we are subject
to the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), which
contains anti-money laundering and financial
transparency laws designed to detect and deter
money laundering and the financing of terrorism,
as well as record-keeping, reporting, due
diligence and customer verification requirements,
various sanctions programs administered and
enforced by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s
Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and
foreign jurisdictions, which target entities or
individuals that are, or are located in countries
that are, involved in activities, such as
terrorism, hostilities, drug trafficking or human
rights violations and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act (FCPA) and the U.K. Bribery Act,
relating to corrupt and illegal payments to
government officials and others. In 2024, federal
regulators, including the Federal Reserve and the
OCC, proposed amendments to update the
requirements for supervised institutions to
establish, implement and maintain effective,
risk-based and reasonably designed anti-money
laundering programs, including the
identification, evaluation and documentation of
money laundering risks.
 Source of Strength 
Under the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and
Consumer Protection Act (the Financial Reform
Act) and Federal Reserve policy, BHCs are
expected to act as a source of financial strength
to each subsidiary bank and to commit resources
to support each such subsidiary. Similarly, under
the cross-guarantee provisions of the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of
1991 (FDICIA), in the event of a loss suffered or
anticipated by the FDIC, either as a result of
default of a bank subsidiary or related to FDIC
assistance provided to such a subsidiary in
danger of default, the affiliate banks of such a
subsidiary may be assessed for the FDIC’s loss,
subject to certain exceptions.
 Transactions with Affiliates 
Pursuant to Section 23A and 23B of the Federal
Reserve Act, as implemented by the Federal
Reserve’s Regulation W, the Banks are subject to
restrictions that limit certain types of
transactions between the Banks and their nonbank
affiliates. In general, U.S. banks are subject to
quantitative and qualitative limits on extensions
of credit, purchases of assets and certain other
transactions involving their nonbank affiliates.
Additionally, transactions between U.S. banks and
their nonbank affiliates are required to be on
arm’s length terms and must be consistent with
standards of safety and soundness.
 Bank of America4 
 Deposit Insurance 
Deposits placed at U.S. domiciled banks are
insured by the FDIC, subject to limits and
conditions of applicable law and the FDIC’s
regulations. Pursuant to the Financial Reform
Act, FDIC insurance coverage limits are $250,000
per depositor, per insured bank for each account
ownership category. All insured depository
institutions are required to pay assessments to
the FDIC in order to fund the DIF.
The FDIC is required to maintain a statutory
minimum ratio of the DIF to insured deposits in
the U.S. of at least 1.35 percent and has
established a long-term goal of a two percent DIF
ratio. As of the date of this report, the DIF is
below the statutory minimum ratio and the FDIC’s
long-term goal. In October 2022, the FDIC adopted
a restoration plan that includes an increase in
deposit insurance assessments across the industry
of two basis points (bps). The FDIC has indicated
that it intends to maintain such assessment rates
for the foreseeable future. Deposit insurance
assessment rates are subject to change by the
FDIC and will be impacted by the overall economy
and the stability of the banking industry as a
whole. The FDIC also has the authority to charge
special assessments from time to time, including
in connection with systemic risk events. For
example, in 2023, the FDIC issued its final rule
to impose a special assessment to recover the
loss to the DIF resulting from the closure of
Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. For more
information on the impact to the Corporation of
the FDIC special assessment, see Note 12 –
Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated
Financial Statements. For more information
regarding deposit insurance, see Item 1A. Risk
Factors – Regulatory, Compliance and Legal on
page 17.
 Capital, Liquidity and Operational Requirements 
As a financial holding company, we and our bank
subsidiaries are subject to the regulatory
capital and liquidity rules issued by the Federal
Reserve and other U.S. banking regulators,
including the OCC and the FDIC. These rules are
complex and continue to evolve as U.S. and
international regulatory authorities propose and
enact amendments to these rules. The Corporation
seeks to manage its capital position to maintain
sufficient capital to satisfy these regulatory
rules and to support our business activities.
These continually evolving rules are likely to
influence our planning processes and may require
additional regulatory capital and liquidity, as
well as impose additional operational and
compliance costs on the Corporation.
For more information on regulatory capital rules
and capital composition, see Capital Management
on page 48, Note 16 – Regulatory Requirements and
Restrictions to the Consolidated Financial
Statements, which are incorporated by reference
in this Item 1, and Item 1A. Risk Factors –
Regulatory, Compliance and Legal on page 17.
 Distributions 
We are subject to various regulatory policies and
requirements relating to capital actions,
including payment of dividends and common stock
repurchases. For instance, Federal Reserve
regulations require major U.S. BHCs to submit a
capital plan as part of an annual Comprehensive
Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR).
Our ability to pay dividends and make common
stock repurchases depends in part on our ability
to maintain regulatory capital levels above
minimum requirements plus buffers and non-capital
standards established under the FDICIA. To the
extent that the Federal Reserve increases our
stress
capital buffer (SCB), global systemically
important bank (G-SIB) surcharge or
countercyclical capital buffer, our returns of
capital to shareholders, including dividends and
common stock repurchases, could decrease. As part
of its CCAR, the Federal Reserve conducts stress
testing on parts of our business using
hypothetical economic scenarios prepared by the
Federal Reserve. Those scenarios may affect our
CCAR stress test results, which may impact the
level of our SCB. For example, based on the
results of our 2024 CCAR stress test, the
Corporation’s SCB increased to 3.2 percent.
Additionally, the Corporation’s G-SIB surcharge
increased to 3.0 percent on January 1, 2024. The
Federal Reserve could also impose limitations or
prohibitions on taking capital actions such as
paying or increasing dividends or repurchasing
common stock, including as a result of economic
disruptions or events.
If the Federal Reserve finds that a bank is not
“well-capitalized” or “well-managed,” the bank’s
BHC would be required to enter into an agreement
with the Federal Reserve to comply with all
applicable capital and management requirements,
which may contain additional limitations or
conditions relating to its activities.
Additionally, the applicable federal regulatory
authority is authorized to determine, under
certain circumstances relating to the financial
condition of a bank or BHC, that the payment of
dividends would be an unsafe or unsound practice
and to prohibit payment thereof.
Many of our subsidiaries, including our bank and
broker-dealer subsidiaries, are subject to laws
that restrict dividend payments, or authorize
regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of
funds from those subsidiaries to the parent
company or other subsidiaries. The rights of the
Corporation, our shareholders and our creditors
to participate in any distribution of the assets
or earnings of our subsidiaries are further
subject to the prior claims of creditors of the
respective subsidiaries.
For more information regarding distributions,
including the minimum capital requirements, see
Note 13 – Shareholders’ Equity and Note 16 –
Regulatory Requirements and Restrictions to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.
 Resolution Planning 
As a BHC with greater than $250 billion of
assets, every two years the Corporation is
required by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC to
submit a plan for a rapid and orderly resolution
in the event of material financial distress or
failure.
Such resolution plan is intended to be a detailed
roadmap for the orderly resolution of the BHC,
including the continued operations or solvent
wind down of its material entities, pursuant to
the U.S. Bankruptcy Code under one or more
hypothetical scenarios assuming no extraordinary
government assistance.
If both the Federal Reserve and the FDIC
determine that the BHC’s plan is not credible,
the Federal Reserve and the FDIC may jointly
impose more stringent capital, leverage or
liquidity requirements or restrictions on growth,
activities or operations. A summary of our plan
is available on the Federal Reserve and FDIC
websites.
The FDIC also requires the submission of a
resolution plan for Bank of America, National
Association (BANA), which must describe how the
insured depository institution would be resolved
under the bank resolution provisions of the
Federal Deposit Insurance Act. A description of
this plan is available on the FDIC’s website.
 5Bank of America 
We continue to make progress to enhance our
resolvability, which includes continued
improvements to our preparedness and exercise
capabilities to implement our resolution plan,
both from a financial and operational standpoint.
Across international jurisdictions, resolution
planning is the responsibility of national
resolution authorities (RA) and central
resolution authorities (CA). Among those, the
jurisdictions with the greatest impact to the
Corporation’s subsidiaries are the U.K., Ireland,
France, Mexico, Hong Kong, Indonesia, the
Philippines and Malaysia where rules have been
issued requiring the submission of significant
information about locally incorporated
subsidiaries as well as the Corporation’s banking
branches located in those jurisdictions that are
deemed to be material for resolution planning
purposes. As a result of the RA’s and CA's review
of the submitted information, we could be
required to take certain actions over the next
several years that could increase operating costs
and potentially result in the restructuring of
certain businesses and subsidiaries.
For more information regarding our resolution
plan, see Item 1A. Risk Factors – Liquidity on
page 9.
 Insolvency and the Orderly Liquidation Authority 
Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, the FDIC
may be appointed receiver of an insured
depository institution if it is insolvent or in
certain other circumstances. In addition, under
the Financial Reform Act, when a systemically
important financial institution (SIFI) such as
the Corporation is in default or danger of
default, the FDIC may be appointed receiver in
order to conduct an orderly liquidation of such
institution. In the event of such appointment,
the FDIC could, among other things, invoke the
orderly liquidation authority, instead of the
U.S. Bankruptcy Code, if the Secretary of the
Treasury makes certain financial distress and
systemic risk determinations. The orderly
liquidation authority is modeled in part on the
Federal Deposit Insurance Act, but also adopts
certain concepts from the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
The orderly liquidation authority contains
certain differences from the U.S. Bankruptcy
Code. For example, in certain circumstances, the
FDIC could permit payment of obligations it
determines to be systemically significant (e.g.,
short-term creditors or operating creditors) in
lieu of paying other obligations (e.g., long-term
creditors) without the need to obtain creditors’
consent or prior court review. The insolvency and
resolution process could also lead to a large
reduction or total elimination of the value of a
BHC’s outstanding equity, as well as impairment
or elimination of certain debt.
Under the FDIC’s “single point of entry” strategy
for resolving SIFIs, the FDIC could replace a
distressed BHC with a bridge holding company,
which could continue operations and result in an
orderly resolution of the underlying bank, but
whose equity is held solely for the benefit of
creditors of the original BHC.
Furthermore, the Federal Reserve requires that
BHCs maintain minimum levels of long-term debt
required to provide adequate loss absorbing
capacity in the event of a resolution.
For more information regarding our resolution,
see Item 1A. Risk Factors – Liquidity on page 9.
 Limitations on Acquisitions 
The Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching
Efficiency Act of 1994 permits a BHC to acquire
banks located in states other than its home state
without regard to state law, subject to certain
conditions, including the condition that the BHC,
after and as a result of the acquisition,
controls no more than 10 percent of the total
amount of deposits of insured depository
institutions in the U.S. and no more than 30
percent or such
lesser or greater amount set by state law of such
deposits in that state. At June 30, 2024, we held
greater than 10 percent of the total amount of
deposits of insured depository institutions in
the U.S.
In addition, the Financial Reform Act restricts
acquisitions by a financial institution if, as a
result of the acquisition, the total liabilities
of the financial institution would exceed 10
percent of the total liabilities of all financial
institutions in the U.S. At June 30, 2024, our
liabilities did not exceed 10 percent of the
total liabilities of all financial institutions
in the U.S.
 The Volcker Rule 
The Volcker Rule prohibits insured depository
institutions and companies affiliated with
insured depository institutions (collectively,
banking entities) from engaging in short-term
proprietary trading of certain securities,
derivatives, commodity futures and options for
their own account. The Volcker Rule also imposes
limits on banking entities’ investments in, and
other relationships with, hedge funds and private
equity funds. The Volcker Rule provides
exemptions for certain activities, including
market making, underwriting, hedging, trading in
government obligations, insurance company
activities and organizing and offering hedge
funds and private equity funds. The Volcker Rule
also clarifies that certain activities are not
prohibited, including acting as agent, broker or
custodian. A banking entity with significant
trading operations, such as the Corporation, is
required to maintain a detailed compliance
program to comply with the restrictions of the
Volcker Rule.
 Derivatives 
Our derivatives businesses are subject to
extensive regulation globally, including under
the Financial Reform Act, the European Union (EU)
Markets in Financial Instruments Directive and
Regulation, the European Market Infrastructure
Regulation, analogous U.K. regulatory regimes and
similar regulatory regimes in other
jurisdictions. These regulations, among other
things, require clearing and exchange trading of
certain derivatives, establish capital, margin,
reporting, registration and business conduct
requirements for certain market participants, set
position limits on certain derivatives and set
out derivatives trading transparency
requirements.
In addition, many G-20 jurisdictions, including
the U.S., EU, U.K., and Japan, have adopted
resolution stay regulations to address concerns
that the close-out of derivatives and other
financial contracts could impede orderly
resolution of G-SIBs, and additional
jurisdictions are expected to follow suit.
Generally, these regulations require amendment of
certain financial contracts to provide for
contractual recognition of stays of termination
rights under various statutory resolution regimes
and a stay on the exercise of cross-default
rights based on an affiliate’s entry into
insolvency proceedings. Resolution regulations
may also require contractual recognition by the
counterparty that amounts owed to them may be
written down or converted into equity as part of
a bail in. As resolution stay regulations of a
particular jurisdiction applicable to us go into
effect, we amend impacted financial contracts in
compliance with such regulations either as a
regulated entity or as a counterparty facing a
regulated entity in such jurisdiction.
 Consumer Regulations 
Our consumer businesses are subject to extensive
regulation and oversight by federal and state
regulators. Certain federal consumer finance laws
to which we are subject, including the Equal
Credit Opportunity Act, Home Mortgage Disclosure
Act,
 Bank of America6 
Fair Housing Act, Electronic Fund Transfer Act
(EFTA), Fair Credit Reporting Act, Real Estate
Settlement Procedures Act, prohibitions on
unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices,
Truth in Lending Act and Truth in Savings Act,
are enforced by the CFPB. Other federal consumer
finance laws, such as the Servicemembers Civil
Relief Act, are enforced by the OCC.
 Privacy and Information Security 
We are subject to many U.S. federal, state and
international laws and regulations governing
requirements for maintaining policies and
procedures regarding the collection, disclosure,
use and protection of the personal information of
our customers and employees. The Gramm-Leach-
Bliley Act requires us to periodically disclose
Bank of America’s privacy policies and practices
relating to the disclosure of customer
information and enables retail customers to opt
out of our ability to share information with
unaffiliated third parties, under certain
circumstances. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and
other laws also require us to implement a
comprehensive information security program that
includes administrative, technical and physical
safeguards to provide the security and
confidentiality of customer records and
information. Security and privacy policies and
procedures for the protection of personal and
confidential information are in effect across all
businesses and geographic locations.
Other laws and regulations, at the international,
federal and state level, impact our ability to
share certain information with
affiliates and non-affiliates for marketing
and/or non-marketing purposes, or contact
customers with marketing offers and establish
certain rights of consumers in connection with
their personal information. For example,
California’s Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA),
provides consumers with the right to know what
personal data is being collected, know whether
their personal data is sold or disclosed and to
whom and opt out of the sale of their personal
data, among other rights. In addition , in the EU
and other countries around the world, similar
laws, like the General Data Protection Regulation
( GDPR), afford those countries’ residents with
certain rights related to their information and
may impose additional obligations on financial
institutions. These laws’ impact on the
Corporation was assessed and addressed through
comprehensive compliance implementation programs.
These existing and evolving legal requirements in
the U.S. and abroad, as well as court proceedings
and changing guidance from regulatory bodies,
including the validity of cross-border data
transfer mechanisms from the EU and other
jurisdictions, continue to lend uncertainty to
privacy compliance globally.
Additionally, the Corporation is subject to
evolving information security (including
cybersecurity) LRRs enacted by U.S. federal and
state governments and non-U.S. jurisdictions,
including requirements to develop cybersecurity
programs, policies and frameworks, as well as
provide disclosure and/or notifications of
certain cybersecurity incidents and data
breaches.

│ affected by the financial markets, fiscal, monetary, and regulatory policies, and economic │
│ conditions.General economic, political, social and health conditions in the U.S. and abroad │
│ affect financial markets and our businesses. In particular, global markets may be affected by │

│ changes in gross domestic product (GDP), economic growth or its sustainability, inflation, │
│ supply chain disruptions, consumer spending, employment levels, labor shortages, challenging │
│ labor market conditions, wage stagnation, federal government shutdowns, energy prices, home │
│ prices, commercial property values, bankruptcies and a default by a significant market │
│ participant or class of counterparties, including companies in emerging markets. Global markets │
│ also may be affected by adverse developments impacting the U.S. or global banking industry, │
│ including bank failures, the failure of nonbank financial institutions and liquidity concerns, │
│ fluctuations or other significant changes in both debt and equity capital markets and │
│ currencies, the transition of benchmark rates to alternative reference rates, the impact of the │

│ macroeconomic conditions, as well as result in additional market volatility and disruptions and │
│ recessionary risk.Global uncertainties regarding fiscal and monetary policies present economic │
│ challenges. High and rising debt levels in the U.S. and globally may contribute to interest │
│ rate volatility, which may constrain governments’ fiscal policies, potentially resulting in │
│ adverse economic outcomes. Actions taken by the Federal Reserve or central banks in other │
│ jurisdictions, including changes in target rates, balance sheet management and lending │
│ facilities, are beyond our control and difficult to predict, particularly regarding inflation, │
│ due to the uncertainty of inflationary paths. This can affect interest rates and the value of │
│ financial instruments and other assets, such as debt securities, and impact our borrowers and │
│ potentially increase delinquency rates and may also raise government debt levels, adversely │
│ affect businesses and household incomes, adversely impact the banking sector generally, and │
│ increase uncertainty surrounding monetary policy. Monetary policy has contributed to and may │
│ continue to result in elevated market interest rates and a flat and/or inverted yield curve. │
│ Any increases in policy rates, as a response to inflation persistently above central bank │
│ targets, changes to fiscal or trade policies, or otherwise, could result in higher market │
│ interest rates. Elevated or rising interest rates may continue to result in volatility of │
│ equity and other markets, and volatility of the U.S. dollar, which could impact investor risk │
│ appetite and our borrowers, potentially increasing delinquency rates. Financial market │
│ volatility could also result from uncertainty about the timing and extent of any additional │
│ rate cuts by the Federal Reserve in response to moderating inflation and/or weakening economic │
│ conditions. Any future change in monetary policy by the Federal Reserve, in an effort to │
│ stimulate the economy or otherwise, resulting in lower interest rates would typically result in │
│ lower revenue through lower net interest income, which could adversely affect our results of │
│ operations.Also, changes to existing U.S. laws and regulatory policies and evolving priorities, │
│ including those related to financial regulation, taxation, international trade, fiscal policy, │
│ climate change (including efforts to transition to a low-carbon economy) and healthcare, may │
│ adversely impact U.S. or global economic activity and our clients’, our counterparties’ and our │
│ earnings and operations. Globally, although many central banks have begun to remove monetary │
│ restriction, policy rates in many countries remain at elevated levels. While higher interest │
│ rates have generally had a positive impact on our net interest income, they have negatively │
│ impacted and could continue to negatively impact investment securities, deposits, loan demand │
│ and funding costs. In addition to higher interest rates, wider credit spreads can negatively │
│ impact capital and/or liquidity by reducing the value of debt securities. High and rising │
│ federal debt levels, investor concerns about the U.S. fiscal trajectory, changes to fiscal │
│ policy and uncertainty about the U.S. budget process could lead to lower investor appetite for │
│ U.S. debt securities, higher interest rates and financial market volatility, potentially │
│ impacting broader economic activity. Further, if the U.S. government’s debt ceiling limit is │
│ not raised timely, the ramifications may result in market volatility, ratings downgrades and │
│ limit fiscal policy responses to recessionary conditions. This could have a negative and │
│ potentially severe impact on the U.S. and world economy and financial and capital markets, │
│ including higher interest rates, higher volatility, lower asset values, lower liquidity, │
│ downgrades to U.S. debt, and a weakened U.S. dollar.Changes to international trade and │
│ investment policies by the U.S. or other countries, and the uncertainty about potential │
│ changes, could negatively impact financial markets globally. Significant increases in tariff │
│ rates, either broadly applied or │
 Bank of America8 
targeted at specific goods or trading partners,
including Canada, Latin America and the People’s
Republic of China (China), could adversely impact
economic conditions and/or result in higher
inflation, which could result in financial market
volatility as markets adjust to the incremental
cost of doing business and/or new business models
to reduce the impacts, as well as adversely
impact asset prices. Also, escalation of tensions
between the U.S. and China, including tariff
increases, could lead to further U.S. measures
that adversely affect financial markets, disrupt
world trade and commerce and lead to trade
retaliation, including through the use of counter
tariffs, foreign exchange measures or the large-
scale sale of U.S. Treasury bonds. Any
restrictions on the activities of businesses,
could also negatively affect financial markets.
These developments could adversely affect our
businesses, clients, including demand for our
products and services, our market-making
activities, our and our clients’ securities and
derivatives portfolios, including the risk of
lower re-investment rates in those portfolios,
our level of charge-offs and provision for credit
losses, the carrying value of our deferred tax
assets, our capital levels, our liquidity and our
results of operations.
Increased market volatility and adverse changes
in financial or capital market conditions may
increase our market risk.
Our liquidity, competitive position, business,
results of operations and financial condition are
affected by market risks such as changes in
interest and currency exchange rates,
fluctuations in equity, commodity and futures
prices, trading volumes and prices of securitized
products, the implied volatility of interest
rates and credit spreads and other economic and
business factors. These market risks may
adversely affect, among other things, the value
of our securities, including our on- and off-
balance sheet securities, trading assets and
other financial instruments, the cost of debt
capital and our access to credit markets, the
value of assets under management (AUM), fee
income relating to AUM, client allocation of
capital among investment alternatives, the volume
of client activity in our trading operations,
investment banking, underwriting and other
capital market fees and the general profitability
and risk level of the transactions in which we
engage and our competitiveness with respect to
deposit pricing. The value of certain of our
assets is sensitive to changes in market interest
rates and/or spreads. If the Federal Reserve or a
non-U.S. central bank changes or signals a change
in monetary policy, market interest rates or
credit spreads could be affected, which could
adversely impact the value of such assets.
Changes to fiscal policy, including expansion of
U.S. federal deficit spending and resultant debt
issuance, could also affect market interest
rates. If interest rates decrease, our results of
operations could be negatively impacted,
including future revenue and earnings growth.
Our models and strategies to assess and control
our market risk exposures are subject to inherent
limitations. In times of market stress or other
unforeseen circumstances, previously uncorrelated
indicators may become correlated. Such changes to
the relationship between market parameters may
limit the effectiveness of our hedging strategies
and cause us to incur significant losses. Changes
in correlation can be exacerbated where market
participants use risk or trading models with
assumptions or algorithms similar to ours. In
these and other cases, it may be difficult to
reduce our risk positions due to activity of
other market participants or widespread market
dislocations, including circumstances where asset
values are declining significantly or no market
exists. Where we own securities that do not have
an established liquid trading market or are
otherwise subject to restrictions on sale or
hedging, or
where the degree of accessible liquidity declines
significantly, we may not be able to reduce our
positions and risks associated with such
holdings, so we may suffer larger than expected
losses when adverse price movements take place.
This risk can be exacerbated where we hold a
position that is large relative to the available
liquidity.
If asset values decline, we may incur losses and
negative impacts, including to capital and
liquidity requirements.
We have a large portfolio of financial
instruments, including loans and loan
commitments, securities financing agreements,
asset-backed secured financings, derivative
assets and liabilities, debt securities,
marketable equity securities and certain other
assets and liabilities that we measure at fair
value and are subject to valuation and impairment
assessments. We determine these values based on
applicable accounting guidance, which, for
financial instruments measured at fair value,
requires an entity to base fair value on exit
price and to maximize the use of observable
inputs and minimize the use of unobservable
inputs in fair value measurements. The fair
values of these financial instruments include
adjustments for market liquidity, credit quality,
funding impact on certain derivatives and other
transaction-specific factors, where appropriate.
Gains or losses on these instruments can have a
direct impact on our results of operations,
unless we have effectively mitigated the risk of
our exposures. Increases in interest rates may
cause decreases in residential mortgage loan
originations and could impact the origination of
corporate debt. In addition, increases in
interest rates or changes in spreads may continue
to adversely impact the fair value of our debt
securities and, accordingly, for debt securities
classified as available-for-sale (AFS), adversely
affect accumulated other comprehensive income
and, thus, our capital levels. Increases in
interest rates or changes in spreads could also
adversely impact our regulatory liquidity
position and requirements, which include eligible
AFS debt securities and held-to-maturity (HTM)
debt securities. As our liquidity is dependent on
the fair value of these assets, increases in
market interest rates and/or wider spreads, have
adversely impacted and may continue to adversely
impact the fair value of debt securities,
adversely affecting liquidity levels.
Fair values may be impacted by declining values
of the underlying assets or the prices at which
observable market transactions occur and the
continued availability of these transactions or
indices. The financial strength of
counterparties, with whom we have economically
hedged some of our exposure to these assets, also
will affect the fair value of these assets.
Sudden declines and volatility in the prices of
assets may curtail or eliminate trading
activities in these assets, which may make it
difficult to sell, hedge or value these assets.
The inability to sell or effectively hedge assets
reduces our ability to limit losses in such
positions, and the difficulty in valuing assets
may increase our risk-weighted assets (RWA),
which requires us to maintain additional capital
and increases our funding costs. Values of AUM
also impact revenues in our wealth management and
related advisory businesses for asset-based
management and performance fees. Declines in
values of AUM can result in lower fees earned for
managing such assets.
 Liquidity 
If we are unable to access the capital markets,
have prolonged net deposits outflows, or our
borrowing costs increase, our liquidity and
competitive position will be negatively affected.
Liquidity is essential to our businesses. We fund
our assets primarily with globally sourced
deposits in our bank entities, as well as secured
and unsecured liabilities transacted in the
capital markets. We rely on certain secured
funding sources,
 9Bank of America 
such as repo markets, which are typically short-
term and credit-sensitive. We also engage in
asset securitization transactions, including with
the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), to
help fund a portion of our consumer lending
activities. Our liquidity could be adversely
affected by any inability to access the capital
markets, illiquidity or volatility in the capital
markets, the decrease in value of eligible
collateral or increased collateral requirements
(including as a result of credit concerns for
short-term borrowing), changes to our
relationships with our funding providers based on
real or perceived changes in our risk profile,
prolonged federal government shutdowns, or
uncertainties regarding the impact of GSE
privatization, should it occur.
Also, our liquidity or cost of funds may be
negatively impacted by the unwillingness or
inability of the Federal Reserve to act as lender
of last resort, unexpected simultaneous draws on
lines of credit or deposits, slower client
payment rates, restricted access to the assets of
prime brokerage clients, the withdrawal of or
failure to attract client deposits or invested
funds (e.g., from attrition driven by clients
seeking higher yielding deposits or securities
products, desiring to utilize an alternative
financial institution perceived to be safer,
changing spending behavior due to inflation,
decline in the economy or other drivers resulting
in an increased need for cash), increased
regulatory liquidity, capital and margin
requirements for our U.S. or international banks
and their nonbank subsidiaries, which could
result in the inability to transfer liquidity
internally, changes in patterns of intraday
liquidity usage resulting from a counterparty or
technology failure or other idiosyncratic event
or failure, the default by a significant market
participant or third party (including clearing
agents, custodians, central banks or central
counterparty clearinghouses (CCPs)) or the
inability to sell assets due to illiquid markets
(e.g., no market exists or market saturation).
These factors may increase our borrowing costs
and negatively impact our liquidity.
Several of these factors may arise due to
circumstances beyond our control, such as general
market volatility, disruption, shock or stress,
stress in sovereign debt markets, the emergence
of widespread health emergencies or pandemics and
geopolitical events and/or turmoil (including
military conflicts, such as the Russia/Ukraine
conflict and the conflicts in the Middle East, or
any potential escalation of such conflicts).
Federal Reserve policy decisions (including
fluctuations in interest rates or Federal Reserve
balance sheet composition), negative views or
loss of confidence about us or the financial
services industry generally or due to a specific
news event (e.g., regional bank failures),
changes in the regulatory environment or
governmental fiscal or monetary policies, actions
by credit rating agencies or an operational
problem that affects third parties or us. The
impact of these potentially sudden events,
whether within our control or not, could include
an inability to sell assets or redeem
investments, unforeseen outflows of cash, the
need to draw on liquidity facilities, the
reduction of financing balances and the loss of
equity secured funding, debt repurchases to
support the secondary market or meet client
requests, the need for additional funding for
commitments and contingencies and unexpected
collateral calls, among other things, the result
of which could be increased costs, a liquidity
shortfall and/or impact on our liquidity coverage
ratio.
Our liquidity and cost of funds may be impacted
by our reputation risk, investor behavior and
confidence, debt market disruption, firm specific
concerns or prevailing market conditions,
including changes in interest and currency
exchange rates, significant fluctuations in
equity and futures prices, lower trading volumes
and prices of securitized products and our credit
spreads. Increases in interest rates and our
credit
spreads can increase the cost of our funding and
result in mark-to-market or credit valuation
adjustment exposures. Changes in our credit
spreads are market driven and may be influenced
by market perceptions of our creditworthiness,
including changes in our credit ratings or
changes in broader financial market and
macroeconomic conditions. Changes to interest
rates and our credit spreads occur continuously
and may be unpredictable and highly volatile. We
may also experience net interest margin
compression from offering higher than expected
deposit rates in order to attract and maintain
deposits. Concentrations within our funding
profile, such as maturities, currencies or
counterparties, can also reduce our funding
efficiency.
Reduction in our credit ratings could limit our
access to funding or the capital markets,
increase borrowing costs or trigger additional
collateral or funding requirements.
Our borrowing costs and ability to raise funds
are directly impacted by our credit ratings.
Credit ratings are also important to investors,
clients or counterparties when we compete in
certain markets and seek to engage in certain
transactions, including over-the-counter (OTC)
derivatives. Our credit ratings are subject to
ongoing review by rating agencies, which consider
a number of financial and nonfinancial factors,
including our franchise, financial strength,
performance and prospects, management,
governance, risk management practices, capital
adequacy, asset quality and operations, among
other criteria, as well as factors not under our
control, such as regulatory developments, the
macroeconomic and geopolitical environment and
changes to rating methodologies.
Rating agencies could adjust our credit ratings
at any time and there can be no assurance as to
whether or when a downgrade could occur. Any
reduction could result in a wider credit spread
and negatively affect our access to credit
markets, the related cost of funds, our
businesses and certain trading revenues,
particularly in those businesses where
counterparty creditworthiness is critical. If the
short-term credit ratings of our parent company,
bank or broker-dealer subsidiaries were
downgraded, we may experience loss of access to
short-term funding sources such as repo
financing, and/or incur increased cost of funds
and increased collateral requirements. Under the
terms of certain OTC derivative contracts and
other trading agreements, if our or our
subsidiaries’ credit ratings are downgraded, the
counterparties may require additional collateral
or terminate these contracts or agreements.
While certain potential impacts are contractual
and quantifiable, the full consequences of a
credit rating downgrade are inherently uncertain
and depend upon numerous dynamic, complex and
inter-related factors and assumptions, including
the relationship between long-term and short-term
credit ratings and the behaviors of clients,
investors and counterparties.
Bank of America Corporation is a holding company,
is dependent on its subsidiaries for liquidity
and may be restricted from transferring funds
from subsidiaries.
Bank of America Corporation, as the parent
company, is a separate and distinct legal entity
from our bank and nonbank subsidiaries. We
evaluate and manage liquidity on a legal entity
basis. Legal entity liquidity is an important
consideration as there are legal, regulatory,
contractual and other limitations on our ability
to utilize liquidity from one legal entity to
satisfy the liquidity requirements of another,
including the parent company, which could result
in adverse liquidity events. The parent company
depends on dividends, distributions, loans and
other payments from our bank and nonbank
subsidiaries to fund dividend payments on our
preferred stock and common stock and to fund all
payments on our other obligations, including debt
obligations. Any inability of our subsidiaries to
transfer funds,
 Bank of America10 
pay dividends or make payments to us may
adversely affect our cash flow, liquidity and
financial condition.
Many of our subsidiaries, including our bank and
broker-dealer subsidiaries, are subject to laws
that restrict dividend payments, or authorize
regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of
funds from those subsidiaries to the parent
company or other subsidiaries. Our bank and
broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to
restrictions on their ability to lend or transact
with affiliates, minimum regulatory capital and
liquidity requirements and restrictions on their
ability to use funds deposited with them in bank
or brokerage accounts to fund their businesses.
Intercompany arrangements we entered into in
connection with our resolution planning
submissions could restrict the amount of funding
available to the parent company from our
subsidiaries under certain adverse conditions.
Additional restrictions on transactions with
certain related parties, increased capital and
liquidity requirements and additional limitations
on the use of funds on deposit in bank or
brokerage accounts, as well as lower earnings,
can reduce the amount of funds available to meet
the obligations of the parent company and may
require the parent company to provide additional
funding to such subsidiaries. Regulatory action
that requires additional liquidity at each of our
subsidiaries could impede access to funds we need
to pay our obligations or pay dividends. In
addition, our right to participate in a
distribution of assets upon a subsidiary’s
liquidation or reorganization is subject to prior
claims of the subsidiary’s creditors.
Bank of America Corporation’s liquidity and
financial condition, and the ability to pay
dividends and obligations, could be adversely
affected in the event of a resolution.
Bank of America Corporation, our parent holding
company, is required to submit a plan to the FDIC
and Federal Reserve every two years describing
its resolution strategy under the U.S. Bankruptcy
Code in the event of material financial distress
or failure. Bank of America Corporation’s
preferred resolution strategy is a “single point
of entry” strategy, whereby only the parent
holding company would file for bankruptcy under
the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Certain key operating
subsidiaries would be provided with sufficient
capital and liquidity to operate through severe
stress and to enable such subsidiaries to
continue operating or be wound down in a solvent
manner following a bankruptcy of the parent
holding company. Bank of America Corporation has
entered into intercompany arrangements resulting
in the contribution of most of its capital and
liquidity to key subsidiaries. Pursuant to these
arrangements, if Bank of America Corporation’s
liquidity resources deteriorate so severely that
resolution becomes imminent, it will no longer be
able to draw liquidity from its key subsidiaries
and will be required to contribute its remaining
financial assets to a wholly-owned holding
company subsidiary. This could adversely affect
our liquidity and financial condition, including
the ability to meet our payment obligations, and
our ability to pay dividends and/or repurchase
our common stock.
If the FDIC and Federal Reserve jointly determine
that Bank of America Corporation’s resolution
plan is not credible, they could impose more
stringent capital or liquidity requirements or
restrictions on our growth, activities or
operations. We could also be required to take
certain actions that could impose operating costs
and result in the divestiture of assets or
restructuring of businesses and subsidiaries.
When a G-SIB such as Bank of America Corporation
is in default or danger of default, the FDIC may
be appointed receiver to conduct an orderly
liquidation, and could, among other things,
invoke the orderly liquidation authority, instead
of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, if the Secretary of
the Treasury makes certain
financial distress and systemic risk
determinations. Also, the FDIC could replace Bank
of America Corporation with a bridge holding
company, which could continue operations and
result in an orderly resolution of the underlying
bank, but whose equity would be held solely for
the benefit of our creditors. The FDIC’s “single
point of entry” strategy may result in our
security holders suffering greater losses than
would have been the case under a bankruptcy
proceeding or a different resolution strategy.
If the Corporation is resolved under the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code or the FDIC’s orderly liquidation
authority, third-party creditors of our
subsidiaries may receive significant or full
recoveries on their claims, while security
holders of Bank of America Corporation could face
significant or complete losses.
 Credit 
Economic or market disruptions and insufficient
credit loss reserves may result in a higher
provision for credit losses.
A number of our products expose us to credit
risk, including loans, letters of credit,
derivatives, debt securities, trading account
assets and assets held-for-sale. Deterioration in
the financial condition of our consumer and
commercial borrowers, counterparties or
underlying collateral could adversely affect our
results of operations and financial condition.
Our credit portfolios may be impacted by U.S. and
global macroeconomic and market conditions,
events and disruptions, including declines in
GDP, consumer spending or property values, asset
price corrections, increasing consumer and
corporate leverage, increases in corporate bond
spreads, government shutdowns or policies such as
tax changes, changes in international trade
policy including tariff rates, rising or elevated
unemployment levels, elevated inflation or cost
of living expenses, fluctuations in foreign
exchange or interest rates, as well as the
emergence of widespread health emergencies or
pandemics, extreme weather events and the impacts
of climate change, including acute and/or chronic
extreme weather events and efforts to transition
to a low-carbon economy. Significant economic or
market stresses and disruptions typically have a
negative impact on the business environment and
financial markets, which could impact the
underlying credit quality of our borrowers,
counterparties and assets. Property value
declines or asset price corrections could
increase the risk of borrowers or counterparties
defaulting or becoming delinquent in their
obligations to us, and could decrease the value
of the collateral we hold, which could increase
credit losses. Credit risk could also be
magnified by lending to leveraged borrowers or
declining asset prices, including property or
collateral values, unrelated to macroeconomic
stress. Simultaneous drawdowns on lines of credit
and/or an increase in a borrower’s leverage in a
weakening economic environment, or otherwise,
could result in deterioration in our credit
portfolio, should borrowers be unable to fulfill
competing financial obligations. Increased
delinquency and default rates could adversely
affect our credit portfolios and increase charge-
offs and provisions for credit losses.
A recessionary environment and/or a rise in
unemployment could adversely impact the ability
of our consumer and/or commercial borrowers or
counterparties to meet their financial
obligations and negatively impact our credit
portfolio. Consumers have been and may continue
to be negatively impacted by inflation and/or a
higher cost of living, resulting in drawdowns of
savings or increases in household debt. Elevated
interest rates, which have increased debt
servicing costs for some businesses and
households, may adversely impact credit quality,
particularly in a recessionary environment.
Certain sectors also remain at risk (e.g.,
commercial real estate,
 11Bank of America 
particularly office) as a result of shifts in
demand and tight financial and credit conditions.
Globally, conditions of slow growth or recession
could further contribute to weaker credit
conditions. If the macroeconomic environment or
certain sectors worsen, our credit portfolio, net
charge-offs, provision and allowance for credit
losses could be adversely impacted.
We establish an allowance for credit losses,
which includes the allowance for loan and lease
losses and the reserve for unfunded lending
commitments, based on management's best estimate
of lifetime expected credit losses (ECL) inherent
in our relevant financial assets. The process to
determine the allowance for credit losses uses
models and assumptions that require us to make
difficult and complex judgments that are often
interrelated, including forecasting how borrowers
or counterparties may perform in changing
economic conditions. The ability of our borrowers
or counterparties to repay their obligations may
be impacted by changes in future economic
conditions, which in turn could impact the
accuracy of our loss forecasts and allowance
estimates. There is also the possibility that we
have failed or will fail to accurately identify
the appropriate economic indicators or accurately
estimate their impacts to our borrowers or
counterparties, which could impact the accuracy
of our loss forecasts and allowance estimates.
If the models, estimates and assumptions we use
to establish reserves or the judgments we make in
extending credit to our borrowers or
counterparties, which are more sensitive due to
the current uncertain macroeconomic and
geopolitical environment, prove inaccurate in
predicting future events, we may suffer losses in
excess of our ECL. In addition, changes to
external factors can negatively impact our
recognition of credit losses in our portfolios
and allowance for credit losses.
The allowance for credit losses is our best
estimate of ECL, but there is no guarantee that
it will be sufficient to address credit losses,
particularly if the economic outlook deteriorates
significantly, quickly or unexpectedly. As
circumstances change, we may increase our
allowance, which would reduce earnings. If
economic conditions worsen, impacting our
consumer and commercial borrowers, counterparties
or underlying collateral, and credit losses are
unexpectedly worse, we may increase our provision
for credit losses, which could adversely affect
our results of operations and financial
condition.
Our concentrations of credit risk could adversely
affect our credit losses, results of operations
and financial condition.
We may be subject to concentrations of credit
risk because of a common characteristic or common
sensitivity to economic, financial, public health
or business developments. Concentrations of
credit risk may reside in a particular industry,
geography, product, asset class, counterparty or
within any pool of exposures with a common risk
characteristic. A deterioration in the financial
condition or prospects of a particular industry,
geographic location, product or asset class, or a
failure or downgrade of, or default by, any
particular entity or group of entities could
negatively affect our businesses, and it is
possible our limits and credit monitoring
exposure controls will not function as
anticipated.
We execute a high volume of transactions and have
significant credit concentrations with respect to
the financial services industry, predominantly
comprised of broker-dealers, commercial banks,
investment banks, insurance companies, mutual
funds, hedge funds, CCPs and other institutional
clients. Financial services institutions and
other counterparties are inter-related because of
trading, funding, clearing or other
relationships. Defaults by one or more
counterparties, or market uncertainty about the
financial stability of one or more financial
services institutions, or the financial services
industry generally,
could lead to market-wide liquidity disruptions,
losses, defaults and related disputes and
litigation.
Our credit risk may also be heightened by market
risk when the collateral held by us cannot be
liquidated or is liquidated at prices not
sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan
or derivatives exposure, which may occur from
events that impact the value of the collateral,
such as a sudden change in asset price or fraud.
Disputes with obligors as to the valuation of
collateral could increase with significant market
stress, volatility or illiquidity, and we could
suffer losses if we are unable to realize the
fair value of the collateral or manage declines
in the value of collateral. Also, our
counterparty credit risk can increase if margin
posted by counterparties is insufficient to cover
exposures and elevated counterparty exposure is
accompanied by the counterparty’s likelihood of
default.
We have concentrations of credit risk, including
with respect to our consumer real estate and
consumer credit card exposure, as well as our
commercial real estate and asset managers and
funds portfolios, which represent a significant
percentage of our overall credit portfolio.
Declining home price valuations and demand where
we have large concentrations could result in
increased servicing advances and expenses,
defaults, delinquencies or credit losses. The
impacts of earthquakes, as well as climate
change, such as rising average global
temperatures and sea levels, and the increasing
frequency and severity of extreme weather events
and natural disasters, including droughts,
floods, wildfires and hurricanes, could
negatively impact collateral, the valuations of
home or commercial real estate or our clients’
ability and/or willingness to pay fees,
outstanding loans or afford new products. This
could also cause insurability risk and/or
increased insurance costs to clients. Economic
weaknesses, particularly from increases in
inflation or sustained elevated inflation,
adverse business conditions, market disruptions,
adverse economic or market events, rising
interest or capitalization rates, declining asset
prices, greater volatility in areas where we have
concentrated credit risk or deterioration in real
estate values or household incomes may cause us
to experience higher credit losses in our
portfolios or write down the value of certain
assets. We could also experience continued and
long-term negative impacts to our commercial
credit exposure and an increase in credit losses
within those industries that may be permanently
impacted by a change in consumer preferences or
other industry disruptions.
We also enter into transactions with sovereign
nations, U.S. states and municipalities.
Uncertain economic or political conditions or
policies, such as economic sanctions or increased
tariffs, disruptions to capital markets, currency
fluctuations, changes in commodity prices and
social instability, could adversely impact the
operating budgets or credit ratings of government
entities and expose us to credit and liquidity
risk.
Liquidity disruptions in the financial markets
may result in our inability to sell, syndicate or
realize the value of our positions, increasing
concentrations, which could increase RWA and the
credit and market risk associated with our
positions, and increase operational and
litigation costs.
We may be adversely affected by weaknesses in the
U.S. housing market.
During 2024, the U.S. housing market continued to
be impacted by higher mortgage rates, including
30-year fixed-rate mortgages that more than
doubled from 2021, and higher home prices (in
varying degrees among markets) that have
negatively impacted housing affordability and the
demand for many of our products. Also, our
mortgage loan production volume is generally
influenced by the rate of growth in residential
 Bank of America12 
mortgage debt outstanding and the size of the
residential mortgage market, both of which have
slowed due to higher interest rates and reduced
affordability. A deeper downturn in the condition
of the U.S. housing market could result in
significant write-downs of asset values in
several asset classes, notably mortgage-backed
securities (MBS). If the U.S. housing market were
to further weaken, the value of real estate could
decline, which could result in increased credit
losses and delinquent servicing expenses,
negatively affect our representations and
warranties exposures, and adversely affect our
results of operations and financial condition.
Our derivatives businesses may expose us to
unexpected risks, which may result in losses and
adversely affect liquidity.
We are party to a large number of derivatives
transactions that may expose us to unexpected
market, credit and operational risks that could
cause us to suffer unexpected losses.
Fluctuations in asset values or rates or an
unanticipated credit event, including unforeseen
circumstances that may cause previously
uncorrelated factors to become correlated, may
lead to losses resulting from risks not taken
into account or anticipated in the development,
structuring or pricing of a derivative
instrument. Certain derivative contracts and
other trading agreements provide that upon the
occurrence of certain specified events, such as a
change to our or our affiliates’ credit ratings,
we may be required to provide additional
collateral or take other remedial actions, and we
could experience increased difficulty obtaining
funding or hedging risks. In some cases our
counterparties may have the right to terminate or
otherwise diminish our rights under these
contracts or agreements upon the occurrence of
such events.
We are also a member of various CCPs, which
results in credit risk exposure to those CCPs. In
the event that one or more members of a CCP
defaults on their obligations, we may be required
to pay a portion of any losses incurred by such
CCP. A CCP may also, at its discretion, modify
the margin we are required to post, which could
mean unexpected and increased funding costs and
exposure to that CCP. As a clearing member, we
are exposed to the risk of non-performance by our
clients for which we clear transactions, which
may not be covered by available collateral. Also,
default by a significant market participant may
result in further risk and potential losses.
 Geopolitical 
We are subject to numerous political, economic,
market, reputational, operational, compliance,
legal, regulatory and other risks in the
jurisdictions in which we operate.
We do business throughout the world, including in
emerging markets. Economic or geopolitical stress
in one or more countries could have a negative
impact regionally or globally, resulting in,
among other things, market volatility, reduced
market value and economic output. Our liquidity
and credit risk could be adversely impacted by,
and our businesses and revenues derived from
non-U.S. jurisdictions are subject to, risk of
loss from financial, social or judicial
instability, economic sanctions, changes in
government leadership, including from electoral
outcomes or otherwise, changes in governmental or
central bank policies, expropriation,
nationalization and/or confiscation of assets,
price controls, high inflation, natural
disasters, the emergence of widespread health
emergencies or pandemics, capital controls,
currency re-denomination risk from a country
exiting the EU or otherwise, currency
fluctuations, foreign exchange controls or
movements (caused by devaluation or de-pegging),
unfavorable political and diplomatic
developments, oil price fluctuations and changes
in legislation. These risks are especially
elevated in emerging markets.
Political and economic interactions between the
U.S. and important trading partners, including
China, but also more broadly across the EU, Latin
America and Canada, may result in sanctions,
further tariff increases or other restrictive
actions on cross-border trade, investment and
transfer of data and information technology. Such
actions, which may also include actions taken
against other countries to enforce trade
restrictions, could reduce trade volumes, result
in further supply chain disruptions, increase
costs for producers, and adversely affect our
businesses and revenues, as well as our clients
and counterparties, including their credit
quality.
Slowing growth, recessionary conditions, adverse
geopolitical conditions and political or civil
unrest, foreign trade competition, labor
shortages, wage pressures and elevated inflation
in certain countries pose challenges, including
from volatility in financial markets. Foreign
exchange rates against the U.S. dollar remain
uncertain and potentially volatile, and
depreciation could increase our financial risks
with clients that deal in non-U.S. currencies but
have U.S. dollar-denominated debt.
We invest or trade in the securities of
corporations and governments located in non-U.S.
jurisdictions, including emerging markets.
Revenues from the trading of non-U.S. securities
may be subject to negative fluctuations as a
result of the above factors. Furthermore, the
impact of these fluctuations could be magnified
because non-U.S. trading markets, particularly in
emerging markets, are generally smaller, less
liquid and more volatile than U.S. trading
markets. Risks in one nation can limit our
opportunities for portfolio growth and negatively
affect our operations in other nations, including
our U.S. operations. Market and economic
disruptions may affect consumer confidence levels
and spending, corporate investment and job
creation, bankruptcy rates, levels of incurrence
and default on consumer and corporate debt,
economic growth rates and asset values, among
other factors.
Elevated government debt levels raise the risk of
volatility, significant valuation changes and
political tensions regarding fiscal policy or
defaults on or devaluation of sovereign debt, all
of which could expose us to substantial losses.
Financial markets have been and may continue to
be sensitive to government budget processes and
changes to fiscal policy, as well as any
resulting political turmoil.
Our non-U.S. businesses are also subject to
extensive regulation by governments, securities
exchanges and regulators, central banks and other
regulatory bodies. In many countries, the laws
and regulations applicable to the financial
services and securities industries are less
predictable, prone to change and uncertainty, and
regularly evolving. Significant resources are
spent on determining, understanding and
monitoring foreign LRRs, some with less
predictable legal and regulatory frameworks, as
well as managing our relationships with multiple
regulators in various jurisdictions. Our
inability to remain in compliance with local laws
and manage our relationships with regulators
could result in increased expenses, changes to
our organizational structure and adversely affect
our businesses, reputation and results of
operations in that market.
We are also subject to complex and extensive U.S.
and non-U.S. LRRs, which subject us to costs and
risks relating to bribery and corruption, know-
your-customer requirements, anti-money
laundering, embargo programs and economic
sanctions, which can vary by jurisdiction and
require implementation of complex operational
capabilities and compliance programs. Non-
compliance, including improper implementation,
and/or violations could result in an increase in
operational and compliance costs, and enforcement
actions and civil and criminal penalties against
us and individual employees. The
 13Bank of America 
increasing speed and novel ways in which funds
circulate could make it more challenging to track
the movement of funds and heighten financial
crimes risk. Compliance with these evolving
regulatory regimes and legal requirements depends
on our ability to improve and/or evolve our
processes, controls, surveillance, detection and
reporting and analytic capabilities and could be
adversely impacted by operational failures.
In the U.S., the political uncertainty around the
federal government’s debt ceiling, a growing
federal budget deficit and government debt levels
could create the possibility of U.S. government
defaults on its debt and/or further downgrades to
its credit ratings, and prolonged government
shutdowns, which could weaken the U.S. dollar,
cause market volatility, negatively impact the
global economy and banking system and adversely
affect our financial condition, including our
liquidity. Also, changes in fiscal, monetary,
regulatory, trade and/or foreign policy, labor
shortages, wage pressures, supply chain
disruptions and higher inflation, could increase
our compliance costs and adversely affect our
business operations, organizational structure and
results of operations. Emerging market currency
values and monetary policy settings are
particularly sensitive to such changes in U.S.
monetary policy. Also, elevated or rising U.S.
interest rate levels or high tariff rates, could
result in additional currency volatility and
recessionary conditions in a number of non-U.S.
markets.
We are also subject to geopolitical risks,
including economic sanctions, acts or threats of
international or domestic terrorism, including
responses by the U.S. or other governments
thereto, corporate espionage, increased state-
sponsored cyberattacks or campaigns, civil unrest
and/or military conflicts, including the
escalation of tensions between China and Taiwan,
which could adversely affect business, market
trade and general economic conditions abroad and
in the U.S. The Russia/Ukraine conflict and the
conflicts in the Middle East have magnified such
risks and resulted in regional instability, and
adverse developments in or expansion of these
conflicts could negatively impact commodity and
other financial markets, as well as economic
conditions. Widening regional conflicts resulting
in the involvement of neighboring countries
and/or North Atlantic Treaty Organization member
countries and/or military conflicts in other
areas of the world could result in additional
economic disruptions, financial market
volatility, higher inflation and changes to asset
valuations, which could disrupt our operations
and adversely affect our results of operations.
 Business Operations 
A failure in or breach of our operations or
information systems, or those of third parties or
the financial services industry, could cause
disruptions, adversely impact our businesses,
results of operations and financial condition,
and cause legal or reputational harm.
Operational risk exposure exists throughout our
organization, including risks arising from our
operations and information systems, which
comprise the hardware, software, infrastructure,
backup systems and other technology that we own
or use to collect, process, maintain, use, share,
transmit or dispose of information, including
personal and/or confidential employee, client and
third-party information, which are integral to
the performance of our businesses. Our extensive
interactions with, and reliance on, third parties
and the financial services industry, including
the processing and reporting of a large number of
complex transactions at increasing speeds in many
currencies and jurisdictions create additional
operational risk to us.
Our operations and information systems and
components thereof, and those of our third
parties, have been, and in the
future will likely be, ineffective or fail to
operate properly or become disabled or damaged as
a result of a number of factors, including events
that may be wholly or partially beyond our or
such third party’s control. Such events have
adversely affected, and in the future could
adversely affect, physical site access of our
operations, the safeguarding of information and
our ability to process transactions, provide
services to our clients and perform other
operations, including reporting and decision-
making. Short-term or prolonged disruptions to
our or our third parties’ critical business
operations and client services are possible, such
as due to computer, telecommunications, network,
utility, electronic or physical infrastructure
outages, including from abuse or failure of our
electronic trading and algorithmic platforms,
significant unplanned increases in client
transactions, fraudulent transactions,
cyberattacks, aging information systems, newly
introduced or identified vulnerabilities or
defects in key hardware and software, failure of
or defects in infrastructure or manual processes,
technology project implementation challenges and
supply chain disruptions. Operational disruptions
and prolonged operational outages could also
result from events arising from natural
disasters, including acute and chronic weather
events, such as wildfires, tornadoes, hurricanes
and floods, some of which are happening with more
frequency and severity, and earthquakes, as well
as local or larger scale political or social
matters, including civil unrest, terrorist acts
and military conflict.
We continue to have greater reliance on our and
our third parties’ remote access tools and
technology, and employees’ personal systems and
increased data utilization and dependence upon
our information systems to operate our
businesses, including from evolving client
preferences, which has led to increased reliance
on digital banking and other digital services
provided by our businesses. Effective management
of our business continuity increasingly depends
on the security, reliability and adequacy of such
systems.
We also rely on our employees, representatives
and third parties in our day-to-day operations,
who may, due to illness, unavailability, the
emergence of widespread health emergencies or
pandemics, human error, misconduct (including
errors in judgment, malice, fraud or illegal
activity), malfeasance or a failure, breach or
misuse of information systems, cause disruptions
to our organization and expose us to operational
losses, regulatory risk and reputational harm.
Our and our third parties’ inability to properly
introduce, deploy and manage operational or
technology changes and continuously alter,
improve and automate processes and systems,
including related controls, such as regarding
internal financial and governance processes,
existing products and services, and new product
innovations and technology, could also result in
additional operational, information security,
reputational and regulatory risk, including from
the use of artificial intelligence (AI), such as
machine learning and generative AI.
Regardless of the measures we have taken to
implement training, procedures, controls, backup
systems and other safeguards to support our
operations and bolster our operational
resilience, our ability to conduct business may
be adversely affected by significant failures or
disruptions to us or to third parties with whom
we interact or upon whom we rely, including
localized or systemic cyber events or other
technology incidents that result in outages or
unavailability of information systems, part or
all of the internet, cloud services and/or the
financial services industry infrastructure
(including funds transfers, electronic trading
and algorithmic platforms and critical banking
activities), which could be exacerbated by the
concentration of third-party service providers or
third-party
 Bank of America14 
models, including AI, and result in systemic
operational impact across the financial services
industry or beyond. Our ability to implement
backup systems and other safeguards with respect
to third-party systems and the financial services
industry infrastructure is more limited than with
respect to our systems. Weakness in and/or the
inability to simplify and improve our and our
third parties’ processes or controls could impact
our ability to deliver products or services to
our clients and expose us to regulatory,
reputational and operational risks.
There can be no assurance that our resiliency,
business continuity, technology change and
information security response plans will
effectively mitigate our operational risks. Any
backup systems or manual processes may not
process data accurately and/or as quickly or
effectively as our primary systems, and some data
might not be available or backed up. Also, the
speed in which we are able to remediate any
failure or disruption of our operations and/or
information systems may vary across
jurisdictions. We regularly update the
operational processes and information systems we
rely on to support our operations and growth,
including as part of our efforts to comply with
all applicable LRRs globally. This updating
entails significant costs and creates risks
associated with implementing new or modified
operational processes and information systems and
integrating them with existing information
systems, including business interruptions,
failures or ineffectiveness.
Increasing reliance on our information systems
and frequency of natural disasters heighten our
risk of operational loss. Any failure or
disruption of our or our third parties’
operations or information systems resulting in
disruption to our critical business operations
and client services, a failure to identify or
effectively respond to operational risks timely
and/or a failure to continue to deliver our
services through an operational failure or
disruption could impact the confidentiality,
integrity or availability of data and
information, and expose us to various risks,
including market abuse, fraud, financial losses
and other costs, misappropriation and corruption,
loss of trust or confidence in us and/or the
financial services industry, client attrition,
regulatory (e.g., LRR compliance), market,
privacy and liquidity risk, adversely impact our
results of operations and financial condition and
cause legal, regulatory or reputational harm.
The Corporation and third parties with whom we
interact and/or on whom we rely, are subject to
cybersecurity incidents, information and security
breaches, and technology failures that have and
in the future could adversely affect our ability
to conduct our businesses, result in the
alteration, unavailability, misuse, destruction
or disclosure of information, damage our
reputation, increase our regulatory and legal
risks, result in additional costs or financial
losses and/or otherwise adversely impact our
businesses and results of operations.
Our business is highly dependent on the security,
controls and efficacy of our information systems,
and the information systems of our clients, third
parties, the financial services industry and
financial data aggregators with whom we interact,
on whom we rely or who have access to our
clients’ personal or account information. We rely
on effective access management and the secure
collection, processing, maintenance, use,
transmission, storage, dissemination and
disposition of information in our and our third
parties’ information systems. Our cybersecurity
risk and exposure remains heightened because of,
among other things, our prominent size and scale,
high-profile brand, geographic footprint and
international presence and role in the financial
services industry and the broader economy. The
proliferation of third-party financial data
aggregators and emerging technologies, including
AI (such as
machine learning and generative AI) and robotics,
increases our cybersecurity risks and exposure,
including by making fraud detection and
authentication more difficult.
We, our employees, customers, regulators and
third parties are ongoing targets of an
increasing number of cybersecurity threats and
cyberattacks. The tactics, techniques and
procedures used in cyberattacks are pervasive,
sophisticated, evolving and designed to evade
security measures, including computer viruses,
malicious or destructive code (such as
ransomware), social engineering (including
phishing, vishing and smishing), real and virtual
impersonation, denial of service or information
or other security breach tactics that have and in
the future are likely to result in disruptions to
our businesses and operations and the loss of
funds, including from attempts to defraud us
and/or our customers, and impact the
confidentiality, integrity or availability of our
information, including intellectual property, or
the personal and/or confidential information of
our employees, clients and third parties.
Cyberattacks are carried out on a worldwide scale
and by a growing number of actors, including
organized crime groups, hackers, terrorist
organizations, extremist parties, hostile foreign
governments and their proxies, state-sponsored
actors, activists, disgruntled employees and
other persons or entities, including for
corporate espionage.
Cybersecurity threats and the tactics, techniques
and procedures used in cyberattacks change,
develop and evolve rapidly and continuously,
including from growth in third-party services
that facilitate or carry out cyberattacks and
from emerging technologies, such as AI (including
machine learning and generative AI) and quantum
computing, which may be used to enhance the
tactics, techniques and procedures described
above and facilitate new cyber threats. Despite
substantial efforts to protect the integrity and
resilience of our information systems and
implement controls, processes, policies, employee
training and other protective measures, we cannot
anticipate and detect all cybersecurity threats
and incidents and/or develop or implement
effective preventive or defensive measures
designed to prevent, respond to or mitigate all
cybersecurity threats and incidents. Internal
access management or other technology failures
could impact the confidentiality, integrity or
availability of data and information. Our
vulnerability increases if employees fail to
exercise sound judgment and vigilance when
targeted with social engineering or other
cyberattacks increases our vulnerability.
Our risk from and exposure to cybersecurity
threats and incidents, information and security
breaches and technology failures continues to
increase due to the acceptance and use of digital
banking and other digital products and services,
including mobile banking products, and reliance
on remote access tools and other technology,
which have increased our reliance on virtual or
digital interactions and a growing number of
access points to our information systems that
must be secured, and results in greater amounts
of information being available for access.
Greater demand on our information systems and
security tools and processes will likely
continue.
We also face significant third-party technology,
cybersecurity and operational risks relating to
the large number of clients and third parties
with whom we do business, the financial services
industry, upon whom we rely to facilitate or
enable our business activities or upon whom our
clients rely, including the secure collection,
processing, maintenance, use, sharing,
dissemination and disposition of client and other
sensitive information, providers of products and
services, financial counterparties, financial
data aggregators, financial intermediaries, such
as clearing agents, exchanges and clearing
 15Bank of America 
houses, regulators, federal and state
governments, providers of outsourced software,
services and infrastructure, such as internet
access, cloud service providers and electrical
power, and retailers for whom we process
transactions. Such third-party information
systems extend beyond our security and control
systems, and such third parties have varying
levels of security and cybersecurity resources,
expertise, safeguards, controls and capabilities.
Threat actors may actively seek to exploit third-
party security and cybersecurity weaknesses, and
the relationships of our third parties with us
may increase the risk that they are targeted by
the same threats we face, and such third parties
may be less prepared for such threats. Also, we
are at risk from critical third-party information
security and open-source or proprietary software
defects and vulnerabilities. We must rely on our
third parties to adequately detect and promptly
report cybersecurity incidents. Their failure
could adversely affect our ability to report or
respond to cybersecurity incidents effectively or
timely.
Due to increasing consolidation, interdependence
and complexity of financial entities and
technology and information systems, a
cybersecurity threat or incident, information or
security breach or technology failure that
significantly exposes, degrades, destroys,
renders unavailable or compromises the
information systems or information of one or more
financial entities or third parties could
adversely impact us and increase the risk of
operational failure and loss, as disparate
information systems need to be integrated, often
on an accelerated basis. Similarly, any
cybersecurity threat or incident, information or
security breach or technology failure that
significantly exposes, degrades, destroys,
renders unavailable or compromises our
information systems or information could
adversely impact third parties and the critical
infrastructure of the financial services
industry, thereby creating additional risk for
us.
Cybersecurity incidents or information or
security breaches could persist for an extended
period of time prior to detection, and it often
takes additional time to determine the scope,
extent, amount and type of impact, including the
information altered, destroyed, accessed or
otherwise compromised, following which the
measures to recover and restore to a business-as-
usual state may be difficult to assess and
require notification to our clients, government
officials and regulators. We have spent and
expect to continue to spend significant resources
to modify and enhance our protective measures and
our capabilities to respond and recover,
investigate and remediate software and network
defects and vulnerabilities, and defend against,
detect and respond to cybersecurity threats and
incidents, whether to us, third parties, the
industry or businesses generally.
While we and our third parties have experienced
cybersecurity incidents, information and security
breaches and technology failures, as well as
adverse impacts from such events, including as
described in this risk factor, we have not
experienced material losses or other material
consequences relating to cybersecurity incidents,
information or security breaches or technology
failures, whether directed at us or our third
parties. However, we expect to continue to
experience such events and impacts ourself and at
our third parties with increased frequency and
severity due to the evolving threat environment,
and there can be no assurance that future
cybersecurity incidents, information and security
breaches and technology failures, including as a
result of cybersecurity incidents, information
and security breaches and technology failures
experienced by our third parties, will not have a
material adverse impact on us, including our
businesses, results of operations and financial
condition.
Future cybersecurity incidents, information or
security breaches or technology failures suffered
by us or our third parties could result in
disruption to our day-to-day business activities
and an inability to effect transactions, execute
trades, service our clients, safeguard
information, manage our exposure to risk, expand
our businesses, detect and prevent fraudulent or
unauthorized transactions, including transactions
impacting our clients, maintain information
systems access and business operations and client
services, in the U.S. and/or globally. Also, we
could experience the loss of clients and business
opportunities, the withdrawal of client deposits,
the misappropriation, alteration or destruction
of our or our third parties’ intellectual
property or confidential information, the
unauthorized access to or temporary or permanent
loss or theft of information, including of our
employees and clients, significant lost revenue,
increased risk of fraudulent transactions, losses
and claims brought by third parties, violations
of applicable privacy, cybersecurity and other
LRRs, litigation exposure, economic sanctions,
enforcement actions, government fines, penalties
or intervention and other negative consequences.
Although we maintain cyber insurance, there can
be no assurance that liabilities or losses we may
incur will be covered under such policies or that
the amount of insurance will be adequate. In the
case of any cybersecurity incident, information
or security breach or technology failure arising
from third-party systems impacting us, any third-
party indemnification may not be applicable or
sufficient to address the impact of such
cybersecurity incidents, information or security
breaches or technology failures, including
monetary losses of the Corporation. The
occurrence of any of the events described above
could adversely impact our businesses, results of
operations, liquidity and financial condition,
and cause reputational harm, whether such events
are actual or perceived.
Failure to satisfy our obligations as servicer
for residential mortgage securitizations, loans
owned by other entities and other related losses
could adversely impact our reputation, servicing
costs or results of operations.
We service mortgage loans on behalf of third-
party securitization vehicles and other
investors. If a material breach of our
obligations as servicer or master servicer is
committed, we may be subject to termination if
the breach is not cured timely following notice,
which could cause us to lose servicing income. We
may also have liability for any failure by us or
a third party, as a servicer or master servicer
to adhere to or perform the required servicing
obligation in accordance with the terms of the
servicing agreements that result in impairment or
loss to the loans’ owner. If any such breach was
found to have occurred, it may harm our
reputation, increase our servicing costs or
losses due to potential indemnification
obligations, result in litigation or regulatory
action or adversely impact our results of
operations. Also, foreclosures may result in
costs, litigation or losses due to irregularities
in the underlying documentation, or if the
validity of a foreclosure action is challenged by
a borrower or overturned by a court because of
errors or deficiencies in the foreclosure
process. We may also incur costs or losses
relating to delays or alleged deficiencies in
processing documents necessary to comply with
state law governing foreclosure.
Changes in the structure of and relationship
among the GSEs could adversely impact our
business.
We rely on the GSEs to guarantee or purchase
certain mortgage loans that meet their conforming
loan requirements. During 2024, we sold
approximately $1.5 billion of loans to GSEs,
primarily Freddie Mac (FHLMC). FHLMC and Fannie
Mae are currently in conservatorship, with the
Federal Housing Finance Agency acting as
conservator. While there have been
 Bank of America16 
periodic proposals to remove or exit the GSEs
from conservatorship and eliminate the perceived
“implicit guarantee” associated with the GSEs,
none have been successful. We cannot predict the
future prospects of the GSEs, including the
timing of any recapitalization or release from
conservatorship, or any legislative or rulemaking
proposals regarding the GSEs’ status in the
housing market. If the GSEs take a reduced role
in the marketplace, including by limiting the
mortgage products they offer, we could be
required to seek alternative funding sources,
retain additional loans on our balance sheet,
secure funding through the Federal Home Loan Bank
system, or securitize the loans through Private
Label Securitization, which could increase our
cost of funds related to the origination of new
mortgage loans, increase credit risk and/or
impact our capacity to originate new mortgage
loans. These developments could adversely affect
our securities portfolios, capital levels,
liquidity and results of operations.
Our risk management framework may not be
effective in mitigating risk and reducing the
potential for losses.
Our risk management framework is designed to
minimize our risk and loss. We seek to
effectively and consistently identify, measure,
monitor, report and control the risk types to
which we are subject, including the seven key
risk types we face. Risks also may span across
multiple key risk types, including cybersecurity
risk, climate risk, legal risk and concentration
risk. While we employ a broad and diversified set
of controls and risk mitigation techniques,
including modeling and forecasting, hedging
strategies and techniques seeking to balance our
ability to profit from trading positions with our
exposure to potential losses, we are inherently
limited by our ability to identify and measure
all risks, including emerging and unknown risks,
anticipate the timing and impact of risks, apply
effective hedging strategies, make correct
assumptions, manage and aggregate data correctly
and efficiently, identify changes in markets or
client behaviors not historically reflected and
develop risk management models and forecasts to
assess and control risk.
Our risk management depends on our ability to
consistently execute all elements of our risk
management program, develop and maintain a
culture of managing risk well throughout the
Corporation and manage third-party risks,
including providers of products and services, to
allow for effective risk management and help
confirm that risks are appropriately considered,
evaluated and responded to timely. Uncertain
economic and geopolitical conditions, widespread
health emergencies and pandemics, heightened
legislative and regulatory scrutiny of and change
within the financial services industry, the pace
of technological changes, including AI (such as
machine learning and generative AI) and quantum
computing, accounting, tax and market
developments, the failure of employees,
representatives and third parties to comply with
our policies and Risk Framework and the overall
complexity of our operations, among other
developments, have in the past and may in the
future, result in a heightened level of risk,
including operational, reputational and
compliance risk. Failure to manage evolving risks
or properly anticipate, escalate, manage, control
or mitigate risks could result in additional
legal, regulatory and reputational risk, losses
and adversely affect our results of operations.
 Regulatory, Compliance and Legal 
We are highly regulated and subject to evolving
government legislation and regulations and
certain settlements, orders and agreements with
government authorities from time to time.
We are highly regulated and subject to evolving
and comprehensive regulation under federal and
state laws in the U.S. and the laws of the
various foreign jurisdictions in which we
operate. These laws and regulations significantly
affect and have the potential to increase our
compliance costs, restrict the scope of our
existing businesses, require changes to our
employment practices, business strategies and
controls and procedures, limit our ability to
pursue certain business opportunities, including
the products and services we offer, reduce
certain fees and rates and/or make our products
and services more expensive for our clients. We
are also required to file various financial and
nonfinancial regulatory reports to comply with
LRRs in the jurisdictions in which we operate,
which results in additional compliance and
operational risk.
We continue to adjust our business and
operations, legal entity structure, systems,
disclosure, policies, procedures, processes,
controls and governance, including with regard to
capital and liquidity management, risk management
and data management, in an effort to comply with
LRRs, and evolving expectations, guidance and
interpretation by regulatory authorities,
including the Department of Treasury (including
the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and OFAC),
Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, Federal
Reserve, OCC, CFPB, Financial Stability Oversight
Council, FDIC, Department of Labor, SEC and CFTC
in the U.S., foreign regulators, other government
authorities and self-regulatory organizations.
Further, we expect to become subject to future
LRRs, including beyond those currently proposed,
adopted or contemplated in the U.S. or abroad,
and evolving interpretations of existing and
future LRRs, which may include policies and
rulemaking related to FDIC assessments, loss
allocations between financial institutions and
clients regarding the use of our products and
services, including electronic payments, emerging
technologies, such as the development and use of
AI (including machine learning and generative
AI), cybersecurity and data, employment practices
and further climate and environmental risk
management and sustainability reporting and
disclosure, including emissions.
The cumulative effect of all of the current and
possible future legislation and regulations, as
well as related interpretations, on our
litigation and regulatory exposure, businesses,
operations, including our ability to compete, and
profitability remains uncertain and necessitates
that we make certain assumptions with respect to
the scope and requirements of existing,
prospective and proposed LRRs in our business
planning and strategies. If these assumptions
prove incorrect, we could be subject to increased
regulatory, legal and compliance risks and costs,
and potential reputational harm. Also, regulatory
initiatives in the U.S. and abroad may overlap,
and non-U.S. regulations and initiatives may be
inconsistent or conflict with current or proposed
U.S. regulations or with each other, which could
lead to compliance risks and higher costs.
Our regulators’ prudential and supervisory
authority gives them broad power and discretion
to direct our actions, and they have assumed an
active oversight, inspection and investigatory
role across the financial services industry.
Regulatory focus is not limited to LRRs
applicable to the financial services industry,
but includes other significant LRRs that apply
across industries and jurisdictions, including
those related to anti-money laundering, anti-
bribery, anti-corruption know-your-customer
requirements, embargo programs and economic
sanctions.
We are also subject to LRRs in the U.S. and
abroad, including the GDPR and CCPA, and a number
of additional jurisdictions enacting or
considering similar laws or amendments to
existing laws, regarding privacy and the
disclosure, collection, use, sharing and
safeguarding of personally identifiable
information, including our employees, clients,
suppliers, counterparties and other third
parties, the violation of which could result in
litigation, regulatory fines,
 17Bank of America 
enforcement actions and operational loss. Also,
we are and will continue to be subject to new and
evolving data privacy laws in the U.S. and
abroad, which could result in additional costs of
compliance, litigation, regulatory fines and
enforcement actions. There remains complexity and
uncertainty, including potential suspension or
prohibition, regarding data transfer because of
concerns over compliance with LRRs for cross-
border flows and transfers of personal data from
the European Economic Area (EEA) to the U.S. and
other jurisdictions outside of the EEA, resulting
from judicial and regulatory guidance. Other
jurisdictions, including China and India, have
commenced consultation efforts or enacted new
legislation or regulations to establish standards
for personal data transfers. If cross-border
personal data transfers are suspended or
restricted or we are required to implement
distinct processes for each jurisdiction’s
standards, this could result in operational
disruptions to our businesses, additional costs,
increased enforcement activity, new contract
negotiations with third parties, and/or
modification of such data management.
As part of their enforcement authority, our
regulators and other government authorities have
the authority to, among other things, conduct
investigations and assess significant civil or
criminal monetary fines, penalties or
restitution, issue cease and desist orders,
suspend or withdraw licenses and authorizations,
initiate injunctive action, apply regulatory
sanctions or cause us to enter into consent
orders. The amounts paid by us and other
financial institutions to settle proceedings or
investigations have, in some instances, been
substantial and may increase. In some cases,
governmental authorities have required criminal
pleas or other extraordinary terms as part of
such resolutions, which could have significant
consequences, including reputational harm, loss
of clients, restrictions on the ability to access
capital markets, and the inability to operate
certain businesses or offer certain products. Our
responses to regulators and other government
authorities have been and may continue to be
time-consuming and expensive and divert
management attention from our business. The
outcome of any matter, which may last years, may
be difficult to predict or estimate.
The terms of settlements, orders and agreements
that we have entered into with government
entities and regulatory authorities have also
imposed, or could impose, significant operational
and compliance costs on us with respect to
enhancements to our procedures and controls,
losses with respect to fraudulent transactions
perpetrated against our clients, expansion of our
risk and control functions within our lines of
business, investment in technology and the hiring
of significant numbers of additional risk,
control and compliance personnel. For example, in
December 2024, the OCC issued a Consent Order
against BANA relating to certain aspects of
BANA’s BSA, anti-money laundering and economic
sanctions compliance programs, and we continue to
respond to requests for information about similar
aspects of such programs from other regulators.
If we fail to meet the requirements of the
regulatory settlements, orders or agreements to
which we are subject, or, more generally, fail to
maintain risk and control procedures and
processes that meet the heightened standards
established by our regulators and other
government authorities, we could be required to
enter into further settlements, orders or
agreements and pay additional fines, penalties or
judgments, or accept material regulatory
restrictions on our businesses.
Improper actions, behaviors or practices by us,
our employees or representatives that are
illegal, unethical or contrary to our core
values, including the handling of fiduciary
obligations, conflicts of interest and the misuse
of confidential
information, could harm us, our shareholders or
clients or damage the integrity of the financial
markets, and are subject to increasing regulatory
scrutiny across jurisdictions. The complexity of
the regulatory and enforcement regimes in the
U.S., coupled with the global scope of our
operations and the regulatory environment
worldwide, also means that a single event or
practice or a series of related events or
practices may give rise to a significant number
of overlapping investigations and regulatory
proceedings, either by multiple federal and state
agencies in the U.S. or by multiple regulators
and other governmental entities in different
jurisdictions. Actions by other members of the
financial services industry related to business
activities in which we participate may result in
investigations by regulators or other government
authorities.
While we believe that we have an appropriate
approach to developing and implementing risk
management and compliance programs, compliance
risks will continue to exist, particularly as we
anticipate and adapt to new and evolving LRRs and
evolving interpretations, and potential
misconduct by bad actors globally. We also rely
upon third parties who may expose us to
compliance and legal risk. Future legislative or
regulatory actions, and any required changes to
our business or operations or strategy, or those
of third parties upon whom we rely, resulting
from such developments and actions could result
in a significant loss of revenue, impose
additional compliance and other costs or
otherwise reduce our profitability, limit the
products and services that we offer or our
ability to pursue certain businesses and business
opportunities, require us to dispose of certain
businesses or assets, affect the value of assets
held, require changes in training, testing,
governance, controls and procedures and
compensation practices, require us to increase
prices and therefore reduce demand for our
products, or otherwise adversely affect our
businesses.
We are subject to significant financial and
reputational risks from potential liability
arising from lawsuits and regulatory and
government action.
We face significant legal risks in our business,
with a high volume of claims against us and other
financial institutions, including conduct related
to various products, services and markets. The
amount of damages, penalties and fines that
private litigants, including clients and other
counterparties, and regulators seek from us and
other financial institutions continues to be
significant and unpredictable.
U.S. regulators and government agencies regularly
pursue enforcement claims and litigation against
financial institutions, including us, for alleged
violations of law and client harm, including
under the Financial Institutions Reform,
Recovery, and Enforcement Act, the federal
securities laws, the False Claims Act, fair
lending laws and regulations (including the Equal
Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act),
the FCPA, the BSA, regulations issued by OFAC,
Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, antitrust laws, and
consumer protection laws and regulations related
to products and services such as overdraft and
sales practices, including prohibitions on
unfair, deceptive, and/or abusive acts and
practices (UDAAP) under the Consumer Financial
Protection Act and the Federal Trade Commission
Act, and EFTA, as well as other enforcement
action taken by prudential regulators with
respect to safety, soundness and appropriateness
of our business practices. Such claims may carry
significant penalties, restitution and, in
certain cases, treble damages, and the ultimate
resolution of regulatory inquiries,
investigations and other proceedings which we are
subject to from time-to-time is difficult to
predict.
In particular, we are the subject of litigation
regarding our processing of electronic payments
through the Zelle network,
 Bank of America18 
our efforts to detect, prevent and address fraud
perpetrated against our clients and/or the
handling of fraud-related disputes, which could
result in fines, judgments and/or settlements,
and adversely affect our businesses and
strategies due to the treatment of loss
allocations between clients and us, all of which
could also adversely impact other similar
products and services. Further, in addition to
the consent order referenced above regarding
BSA/anti-money laundering and economic sanctions
compliance programs, we have entered into orders
or settlements with certain government agencies
regarding the rates paid on uninvested cash in
brokerage and investment advisory accounts that
is swept into interest-paying bank deposits,
credit card sales and marketing practices and
representment fee practices and our participation
in implementing COVID-19-related government
relief measures and other federal and state
government assistance programs, including the
processing of unemployment benefits for
California and certain other states. We are
subject to, or could become subject to, related
litigation or investigations by other regulators
with respect to the conduct that gave rise to
these orders, or the orders or investigations we
become subject to in the future, which may result
in judgments and/or settlements.
We and our regulators have an increased focus on
information security. This includes cybersecurity
incidents perpetrated against us, our clients,
providers of products and services,
counterparties and other third parties, the
collection, use and sharing of data, and
safeguarding of personally identifiable
information and corporate data, as well as the
development, implementation, use and management
of emerging technologies, including AI, which
have resulted in, and will likely continue to
result in, related litigation or government
enforcement, including with regard to compliance
with U.S. and global LRRs, and could subject us
to fines, judgments and/or settlements and
involve reputational losses. We expect to also
face increasing scrutiny regarding
sustainability-related policies, goals, targets
and disclosure, which could result in litigation,
regulatory investigations and actions and
reputational harm. Misconduct, or the perception
of misconduct, by our employees and
representatives, including conflicts of interest,
unethical, fraudulent, improper or illegal
conduct, the failure to fulfill fiduciary
obligations, unfair, deceptive, abusive or
discriminatory business practices, or violations
of policies, procedures or LRRs, including
conduct that affects compliance with books and
records requirements, have resulted and could
result in further litigation and/or government
investigations and enforcement actions, and cause
significant reputational harm.
The global environment of extensive
investigations, regulation, regulatory compliance
burdens, litigation and regulatory enforcement,
combined with uncertainty related to the
continually evolving regulatory environment, have
affected and are likely to continue to affect
operational and compliance costs and risks,
including the adaptation of business strategies,
the limitation or cessation of our ability or
feasibility to continue providing certain
products and services and our employment
practices. Lawsuits and regulatory actions have
resulted in and will likely continue to result in
judgments, orders, settlements, penalties and
fines adverse to us, in amounts that may be
significant or unpredictable, and in some cases,
exceed the amount of reserves established.
Litigation and investigation costs, substantial
legal liability or significant regulatory or
government action against us could adversely
affect our businesses, financial condition,
including liquidity, and results of operations,
and/or cause significant reputational harm.
U.S. federal banking agencies may require
increased capital and liquidity levels, which
could adversely impact the Corporation.
We are subject to U.S. capital and liquidity
regulations. These rules, among other things,
establish minimum ratios relating to capital for
different categories of assets and exposures to
qualify as a well-capitalized institution. As a
G-SIB, we are also required to hold additional
capital buffers, including a G-SIB surcharge, a
SCB and a countercyclical buffer, which are
reassessed at least annually. Also, we are
subject to regulatory liquidity requirements,
including the Liquidity Coverage Ratio and the
Net Stable Funding Ratio. If any of our
subsidiary insured depository institutions fail
to maintain “well capitalized” status under the
applicable regulatory capital rules, the Federal
Reserve will require us to agree to bring the
insured depository institution back to well-
capitalized status, which may include
restrictions on our activities, such as our
ability to pay dividends and/or repurchase our
common stock. If we were to fail to enter into or
comply with such an agreement, the Federal
Reserve may impose more severe restrictions on
our activities, including requiring us to cease
and desist activities otherwise permitted.
From time to time regulators may change
regulatory capital requirements, including total
loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) and long-term debt
requirements, change how regulatory capital or
RWA is calculated, or increase liquidity
requirements. These components of our capital and
liquidity ratios could also be impacted by
economic disruptions or other events that may
cause an increase in our balance sheet, RWA or
leverage exposures, which could increase the
amounts of regulatory capital or liquidity we are
required to hold.
In 2023, U.S. banking regulators issued notices
of proposed rulemaking to revise the measurement
of RWA and the G-SIB surcharge calculation, both
of which may be re-proposed. Also, in 2023, U.S.
banking regulators issued proposed changes to the
long-term debt requirements for TLAC, which may
impact eligibility of certain debt instruments,
and in 2024, the Federal Reserve separately
confirmed it is considering changes to existing,
as well as new, liquidity requirements. The
timing and composition of any such proposals or
re-proposals remain uncertain due to various
factors, including changes of leadership
positions in the U.S. bank regulatory agencies.
Our ability to pay dividends or repurchase common
stock depends, in part, on our ability to
maintain regulatory capital levels above minimum
requirements plus buffers. If increases occur in
our SCB, G-SIB surcharge or countercyclical
capital buffer, our dividends and common stock
repurchases, could decrease. For example, in
2024, our SCB increased by 70 bps to 3.2 percent
and our G-SIB surcharge increased 50 bps to 3.0
percent. Our G-SIB surcharge is expected to
increase to 3.5 percent from 3.0 percent in 2027,
and could further increase in the future. The
Federal Reserve could also limit or prohibit
capital actions (e.g., impacts to dividends and
common stock repurchases) as a result of economic
disruptions or events.
Extensive regulatory evaluation of our capital
planning practices by the Federal Reserve
includes stress testing on parts of our business
using hypothetical economic scenarios prepared by
the Federal Reserve. Those scenarios may affect
our CCAR stress test results, which may impact
our SCB level and require us to hold additional
capital. In 2024, the Federal Reserve announced
that it intends to propose potential changes to
bank stress tests, which could impact our SCB.
Changes to and compliance with the regulatory
capital and liquidity requirements may impact our
operations by requiring us to liquidate assets,
increase borrowings, issue additional securities,
reduce common stock repurchases or dividends,
limit compensation practices, cease or alter
certain operations, pricing strategies and
business activities or hold highly liquid assets,
adversely affecting our results of operations.
 19Bank of America 
Changes in accounting standards or assumptions in
applying accounting policies could adversely
affect us.
Accounting policies and methods are fundamental
to how we record and report our financial
condition and results of operations. Some of
these policies require the use of estimates and
assumptions that may affect the reported value of
our assets or liabilities and results of
operations and are critical because they require
management to make difficult, subjective and
complex judgments about matters that are
inherently uncertain. If assumptions, estimates
or judgments are erroneously applied, we could be
required to correct and restate prior-period
financial statements. Accounting standard-setters
and those who interpret the accounting standards,
including the SEC, banking regulators and our
independent registered public accounting firm may
also amend or even reverse their previous
interpretations or positions on how various
standards should be applied. These changes may be
difficult to predict and could impact the
preparation and reporting of our financial
statements, including the application of new or
revised standards retrospectively, resulting in
unexpected losses, revisions to prior-period
financial statements and other adverse impacts to
us, including legal and regulatory risk.
We may be adversely affected by changes in U.S.
and non-U.S. tax laws and regulations.
We could be adversely affected if U.S. and
foreign governmental authorities further change
tax laws, including changes to the Tax Cuts and
Jobs Act of 2017 and Inflation Reduction Act of
2022. Also, new guidelines issued by the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD), which are currently being
enacted into law in some OECD countries in which
we operate, are expected to impose a 15 percent
global minimum tax on a country-by-country basis.
Any implementation of and/or change in U.S. and
foreign tax laws and regulations or
interpretations of current or future tax laws and
regulations could materially adversely affect our
effective tax rate, tax liabilities and results
of operations. U.S. and foreign tax laws are
complex and our judgments, interpretations or
applications of such tax laws could differ from
that of the relevant governmental authority. This
could result in additional tax liabilities and
interest, penalties, the reduction of certain tax
benefits and/or the requirement to make
adjustments to amounts recorded, which could be
material.
Also, we have U.K. net deferred tax assets (DTA)
which consist primarily of net operating losses
that are expected to be realized in a U.K.
subsidiary over an extended number of years.
Adverse developments with respect to tax laws or
to other material factors, such as prolonged
worsening of international capital markets or
changes in the ability of our U.K. subsidiary to
conduct business in the markets outside the U.K.,
could lead our management to reassess and/or
change its current conclusion that no valuation
allowance is necessary with respect to our U.K.
net DTA.
 Reputation 
Damage to our reputation could harm our
businesses, including our competitive position
and business prospects.
Our ability to attract and retain clients,
investors and employees is impacted by our
reputation. Harm to our reputation can arise from
various sources, including actual or perceived
activities of our officers, directors, employees,
other representatives, clients and third parties,
including counterparties, such as fraud,
misconduct and unethical behavior, adequacy of
our ability to detect, prevent and/or respond to
fraud perpetrated against our clients, and the
handling of related disputes regarding the use of
our products
and services, including electronic payments,
effectiveness of our internal controls, the fees
charged to our clients, including overdraft and
non-sufficient funds fees, compensation
practices, lending practices, suitability or
reasonableness of particular trading or
investment strategies, the services offered to
our clients, the reliability of our research and
models and prohibiting clients from engaging in
certain transactions.
Our reputation may also be harmed by actual or
perceived failure to deliver the products,
standards of service and quality expected by our
clients and the community, including the
overstatement or mislabeling of the environmental
benefits of our products, services or
transactions, the failure to protect our clients
and/or recognize and address client complaints,
compliance failures, technology changes, the
implementation, management and use of emerging
technologies, including AI, the failure to
maintain effective data management, cybersecurity
incidents and information and security breaches
affecting us and our employees, clients and third
parties, which have occurred and which we expect
to continue to occur with increased frequency and
severity, prolonged or repeated system outages,
our privacy policies, the unintended disclosure
of or failure to safeguard personal, proprietary
or confidential information, the breach of our
fiduciary obligations, employment practices and
the handling of widespread health emergencies or
pandemics. Our reputation may also be harmed by
litigation and/or regulatory matters and their
outcomes, and/or criticism or challenges by third
parties, relating to the topics discussed above
or otherwise. Challenges and criticisms to our
environmental and social practices and
disclosures, and those of our clients and third
parties, including from third parties, who may
have diverging views regarding those practices
and disclosures, may also harm our reputation.
Increases in market interest rates have resulted
in increased focus on asset and liability
management, including HTM and AFS securities and
related unrealized losses. Perceptions of our
liquidity and financial condition, actions by the
financial services industry generally, or by
certain members or individuals in the industry
may harm our reputation. Adverse publicity or
negative information posted on social media by
employees, the media or otherwise, whether or not
factually correct, may trigger a loss of trust or
confidence on the part of clients,
counterparties, shareholders, investors, debt
holders, market analysts, other relevant parties
or regulators, adversely impacting our business
prospects and results of operations.
We are subject to complex and evolving LRRs and
interpretations, including regarding fair lending
activity, UDAAP, electronic funds transfers,
know-your-customer requirements, data protection
and privacy (including the GDPR and the CCPA),
cross-border data movement and data localization,
cybersecurity, the use and development of AI,
data and technology and other matters, as well as
evolving and expansive interpretations of these
LRRs. Principles concerning the appropriate scope
of consumer and commercial privacy vary
considerably across jurisdictions, and regulatory
and public expectations regarding the definition
and scope of consumer and commercial privacy and
data protection remains fluid. These laws may be
interpreted and applied by various jurisdictions
inconsistent with our current or future
practices, or with one another. If personal,
confidential or proprietary information of
clients in our possession, or in the possession
of third parties or financial data aggregators,
is mishandled, misused or mismanaged, or if we do
not timely or adequately address such
information, we may face regulatory, legal and
operational risks, which could adversely affect
our reputation, financial condition and results
of operations.
 Bank of America20 
We could suffer reputational harm if we fail to
properly identify and manage potential conflicts
of interest, the management of which has become
increasingly complex as we expand our business
activities through more numerous transactions,
obligations and interests with and among our
clients. The actual or perceived failure to
adequately address conflicts of interest could
affect the willingness of clients to use our
products and services, or result in litigation or
enforcement actions, which could adversely affect
our business.
Our actual or perceived failure to address these
and other issues, such as operational risks,
could give rise to reputational risk that could
harm us and our business prospects, including the
attraction and retention of clients and
employees, and give rise to additional regulatory
restrictions, legal risks and reputational harm,
which could, among other consequences, increase
the size and number of litigation claims and
damages asserted or subject us to enforcement
actions, fines and penalties, and cause us to
incur related costs and expenses.
 Other 
We face significant and increasing competition in
the financial services industry.
We operate in a highly competitive environment
and experience intense competition from local and
global bank and nonbank financial institutions
and new entrants in domestic and foreign markets.
There is increasing pressure to provide products
and services on more attractive terms, including
lower fees, lower cost investment strategies and
higher interest rates on deposits, which may
impact our ability to effectively compete. Also,
we may be disadvantaged from more stringent
regulatory requirements applicable to us than to
nonbank financial institutions or other actual or
perceived competitors.
The growth of and mergers among traditional
financial services companies have increased
competition. Emerging technologies and the growth
of e-commerce have lowered geographic and
monetary barriers of other financial
institutions, made it easier for non-depository
institutions to offer traditional banking
products and services and allowed non-traditional
financial service providers and technology
companies to compete with traditional financial
service companies in providing electronic and
internet-based financial solutions and services,
including electronic securities trading with low
or no fees and commissions, marketplace lending,
financial data aggregation and payment processing
services, including real-time payment platforms.
Further, clients may choose to conduct business
with other market participants who engage in
business or offer products in areas we deem
speculative or risky as an alternative to
traditional products. Increased competition may
reduce our market share, net interest margin and
revenues from our fee-based products and services
and negatively affect our earnings, including by
pressuring us to lower pricing, requiring
additional investment to improve the quality and
delivery of our technology and/or affecting our
clients’ willingness to do business with us.
Our inability to adapt our business strategies,
products and services could harm our business.
We rely on a diversified mix of businesses that
deliver a broad range of financial products and
services through multiple distribution channels.
Our success depends on our and our third-party
providers’ ability to timely change or adapt our
business strategies, products and services and
their respective features, including available
payment processing services and technology, such
as AI and machine learning, to rapidly evolving
industry standards and consumer preferences. Our
strategies could be further impacted by
macroeconomic stress,
widespread health emergencies or pandemics,
cyberattacks, and military conflicts or other
significant geopolitical events.
Widespread adoption and rapid evolution of, as
well as developments in the regulatory landscape
relating to emerging technologies, including
analytic capabilities, AI (including machine
learning and generative AI), automated decision-
making, self-service digital trading platforms
and automated trading markets, internet services,
and digital assets, such as central bank digital
currencies, cryptocurrencies (including
stablecoins), tokens and other cryptoassets that
utilize distributed ledger technology (DLT), as
well as payment, clearing and settlement
processes that use DLT, create additional
strategic risks, could negatively impact our
ability to compete and require substantial
expenditures to the extent we were to modify or
adapt our existing products and services. As new
technologies evolve and mature, our businesses
and results of operations could be adversely
impacted, including as a result of new
competitors to the payments and trading
ecosystems and increased volatility in deposits
and/or significant long-term reduction in
deposits (i.e., financial disintermediation).
Also, we may not be as timely or successful in
assessing the competitive landscape and
developing or introducing new products and
services, integrating new products or services
into our existing offerings, responding, managing
or adapting to changes in consumer behavior,
preferences, spending, investing and/or saving
habits, achieving market acceptance of our
products and services, reducing costs in response
to pressures to deliver products and services at
lower prices or sufficiently developing and
maintaining clients. Further, our businesses may
be negatively impacted if we, or our third-party
providers, do not timely development and apply
emerging technologies, like AI and quantum
computing, or if our initiatives in these areas
are deficient or fail. Our or our third-party
providers’ inability or resistance to timely
innovate or adapt operations, products and
services to evolving regulatory and market
environments, industry standards and consumer
preferences could result in service disruptions,
harm our business and adversely affect our
results of operations and reputation.
We could suffer operational, reputational and
financial harm if our models fail to properly
anticipate and manage risk.
We use models enterprise-wide, including to
forecast losses, project revenue and expenses,
assess and control our operations and financial
condition, assist in capital planning, manage
liquidity and measure, forecast and assess
capital and liquidity requirements for credit,
market, operational and strategic risks. Under
our Enterprise Model Risk Policy, Model Risk
Management is required to perform end-to-end
model oversight, including independent validation
before initial use, implementation monitoring,
ongoing monitoring reviews through outcomes
analysis and benchmarking, and periodic
revalidation. However, models are subject to
inherent limitations from simplifying
assumptions, uncertainty regarding economic and
financial outcomes, and emerging risks, including
from applications that rely on AI.
Our models may not be sufficiently predictive of
future results, such as due to limited historical
patterns, extreme or unanticipated market
movements or clients’ behavior and liquidity,
especially during severe market downturns or
stress events (e.g., geopolitical or pandemic
events), which could limit their effectiveness
and require timely recalibration. The models that
we use to assess and control our market risk
exposures also reflect assumptions about the
degree of correlation among prices of various
asset classes or other market indicators, which
may not be representative of the next downturn
and would magnify the limitations inherent in
using historical data to
 21Bank of America 
manage risk. Market conditions in recent years
have involved unprecedented dislocations and
highlight the limitations inherent in using
historical data to manage risk. Our models may
also be adversely impacted by human error and may
not be effective if we fail to properly oversee,
regularly review and detect their flaws during
our review and monitoring processes, they contain
biases, erroneous data, assumptions, valuations,
formulas or algorithms, or our applications
running the models do not perform as expected.
Regardless of the steps we take to design
effective controls, governance, monitoring and
testing, and implement new technology and
automated processes, we could suffer operational,
reputational and financial harm, including
funding or liquidity shortfalls, and adverse
business decisions and regulatory risk if models
fail to properly anticipate and manage risks.
Failure to properly manage data may adversely
affect our ability to manage compliance risk and
business needs, and result in errors in our
operations, reporting and decision-making, and
non-compliance with LRRs.
We rely on our ability to manage and process data
accurately, timely and completely, including
capturing, transporting, aggregating, using,
transmitting data externally, and retaining and
protecting data appropriately. While we
continually update our policies, programs,
processes and practices and take steps to
leverage emerging technologies, such as
automation, AI and robotics, our data management
processes may not be effective and are subject to
weaknesses and failures, including human error,
data limitations, process delays, system failure
or failed controls. Failure to effectively manage
data accurately, timely and completely may
adversely impact its quality and reliability and
our ability to manage current and emerging risks,
produce accurate financial, nonfinancial,
regulatory, operational, environmental and social
reporting, detect or surveil potential misconduct
or non-compliance with LRRs, and to manage our
business needs, strategic decision-making,
resolution strategy and operations. The failure
to establish and maintain effective, efficient
and controlled data management could adversely
impact our development of products and client
relationships and increase operational losses and
regulatory and reputational risk.
Our operations, businesses and clients could be
adversely affected by the impacts related to
climate change.
Climate change and related environmental
sustainability matters present short-, medium-
and long-term risks. The physical risks include
an increase in the frequency and severity of
extreme weather events and natural disasters,
including floods, wildfires, hurricanes and
tornados, and chronic longer-term shifts such as
rising average global temperatures and sea
levels. Such disasters and effects could
adversely impact our facilities, employees and
clients’ ability to repay outstanding loans,
disrupt the operations of us and our clients or
third parties, cause supply chain or distribution
network disruptions, damage collateral and/or
result in market volatility, rapid deposit
outflows or drawdowns of credit facilities, the
deterioration of the value of collateral or
insurance shortfalls.
There is also increasing risk related to the
transition to a low-carbon economy. Changes in
consumer preferences or financial condition of
our clients and counterparties, market pressures,
advancements in technology and additional
legislation, regulatory, compliance and legal
requirements could alter our strategic planning
and the scope of our existing businesses, limit
our ability to pursue certain business activities
and offer certain products and services, amplify
credit and market risks, negatively impact asset
values, require capital
expenditures and changes in technology and
markets, including supply chain and insurance
availability and cost, increase expenses and
adversely impact our capital requirements and
results of operations. Particularly, there is a
global regulatory focus on climate change and
existing and pending disclosure requirements in
various jurisdictions, with jurisdictional
divergence, which is expected to impact our
legal, compliance and public disclosure risks and
costs.
Our climate change strategies, policies, and
disclosures, which may evolve over time, our
ability to achieve our climate-related goals and
targets and/or the environmental or climate
impacts attributable to our products, services or
transactions may impact legal and compliance risk
and could result in reputational harm as a result
of negative public sentiment, regulatory
scrutiny, litigation and reduced investor and
stakeholder confidence. Due to divergent views of
stakeholders, we are at increased risk that any
action, or lack thereof, by us concerning our
response to climate change will be perceived
negatively by some stakeholders, which could
adversely impact our reputation and businesses.
Our ability to meet our climate-related goals and
targets, including our goal to achieve certain
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions targets by 2030
and net zero GHG emissions in our financing
activities, operations and supply chain before
2050, is subject to risks and uncertainties, many
of which are outside of our control, such as
technological advances, clearly defined roadmaps
for industry sectors, public policies and better
emissions data reporting, and ongoing engagement
with clients, suppliers, investors, government
officials and other stakeholders. Due to the
evolving nature of climate-related risks, which
are expected to increase over time, it is
difficult to predict, identify, monitor and
effectively mitigate climate-related risks and
uncertainties.
Furthermore, there are and will continue to be
challenges related to the availability, quality
and disclosure of climate-related data, including
data obtained from third parties, which may
result in legal, compliance and/or reputational
harm.
Our ability to attract, develop and retain
qualified employees is critical to our success,
business prospects and competitive position.
Our performance and competitive position is
heavily dependent on the talents, development and
efforts of highly skilled individuals.
Competition for qualified personnel is intense
from within and outside the financial services
industry. Our competitors include global
institutions and institutions subject to
different compensation and hiring regulations
than those imposed on us. Also, our ability to
attract, develop and retain employees could be
impacted by our reputation, professional and
development opportunities, changes in regulation
or enforcement practices, changes in workforce
concerns, expectations, practices and preferences
(including remote work), and increasing labor
shortages and competition for labor, which could
increase labor costs.
We must provide market-level compensation to
attract and retain qualified personnel. As a
large financial and banking institution, we are
and may become subject to additional limitations
on compensation practices by the Federal Reserve,
the OCC, the FDIC and other global regulators,
which may not affect our competitors. Also,
because a substantial portion of compensation
paid to many of our employees is equity-based
awards based on the value of our common stock,
declines in our profitability or outlook could
adversely affect the ability to attract and
retain employees. If we are unable to continue to
attract, develop and retain qualified
individuals, our business prospects and
competitive position could be adversely affected.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Bank of America Corporation (the Corporation) and
its management may make certain statements that
constitute “forward-looking statements” within
the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995. These statements can be
identified by the fact that they do not relate
strictly to historical or current facts. Forward-
looking statements often use words such as
“anticipates,” “targets,” “expects,” “hopes,”
“estimates,” “intends,” “plans,” “goals,”
“believes,” “continue” and other similar
expressions or future or conditional verbs such
as “will,” “may,” “might,” “should,” “would” and
“could.” Forward-looking statements represent the
Corporation’s current expectations, plans or
forecasts of its future results, revenues,
liquidity, net interest income, provision for
credit losses, expenses, efficiency ratio,
capital measures, strategy, deposits, assets, and
future business and economic conditions more
generally, and other future matters. These
statements are not guarantees of future results
or performance and involve certain known and
unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions that
are difficult to predict and are often beyond the
Corporation’s control. Actual outcomes and
results may differ materially from those
expressed in, or implied by, any of these
forward-looking statements.
You should not place undue reliance on any
forward-looking statement and should consider the
following uncertainties and risks, as well as the
risks and uncertainties more fully discussed
under Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report
on Form 10-K : and in any of the Corporation’s
subsequent Securities and Exchange Commission
filings: the Corporation’s potential judgments,
orders, settlements, penalties, fines and
reputational damage, which are inherently
difficult to predict, resulting from pending,
threatened or future litigation and regulatory
investigations, proceedings and enforcement
actions, which the Corporation is subject to in
the ordinary course of business, including
matters related to our processing of unemployment
benefits for California and certain other states,
the features of our automatic credit card payment
service, the adequacy of the Corporation’s anti-
money laundering and economic sanctions programs
and the processing of electronic payments,
including through the Zelle network, and related
fraud, which are in various stages; the
possibility that the Corporation’s future
liabilities may be in excess of its recorded
liability and estimated range of possible loss
for litigation, and regulatory and government
actions; the Corporation’s ability to resolve
representations and warranties repurchase and
related claims; the risks related to the
discontinuation of reference rates, including
increased expenses and litigation and the
effectiveness of hedging strategies;
uncertainties about the financial stability and
growth rates of non-U.S. jurisdictions, the risk
that those jurisdictions may face difficulties
servicing their sovereign debt, and related
stresses on financial markets, currencies and
trade, and the Corporation’s exposures to such
risks, including direct, indirect and
operational; the impact of U.S. and global
interest rates (including the potential for
ongoing adjustments in interest rates),
inflation, currency exchange rates, economic
conditions, trade policies and tensions,
including increased tariffs, and geopolitical
instability; the impact of the interest rate,
inflationary, macroeconomic, banking and
regulatory environment on the Corporation’s
assets, business, financial condition and results
of operations; the impact of adverse developments
affecting the U.S. or global banking industry,
including bank failures and liquidity concerns,
resulting in worsening economic and market
volatility, and regulatory responses thereto; the
possibility that future credit losses may be
higher than currently expected due to changes in
economic
assumptions, customer behavior, adverse
developments with respect to U.S. or global
economic conditions and other uncertainties,
including the impact of supply chain disruptions,
inflationary pressures and labor shortages on
economic conditions and our business; potential
losses related to the Corporation's concentration
of credit risk; the Corporation’s ability to
achieve its expense targets and expectations
regarding revenue, net interest income, provision
for credit losses, net charge-offs, effective tax
rate, loan growth or other projections; variances
to the underlying assumptions and judgments used
in estimating banking book net interest income
sensitivity; adverse changes to the Corporation’s
credit ratings from the major credit rating
agencies; an inability to access capital markets
or maintain deposits or borrowing costs;
estimates of the fair value and other accounting
values, subject to impairment assessments, of
certain of the Corporation’s assets and
liabilities; the estimated or actual impact of
changes in accounting standards or assumptions in
applying those standards; uncertainty regarding
the content, timing and impact of regulatory
capital and liquidity requirements; the impact of
adverse changes to total loss-absorbing capacity
requirements, stress capital buffer requirements
and/or global systemically important bank
surcharges; the potential impact of actions of
the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System on the Corporation’s capital plans; the
effect of changes in or interpretations of income
tax laws and regulations; the impact of
implementation and compliance with U.S. and
international laws, regulations and regulatory
interpretations, including recovery and
resolution planning requirements, Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation assessments, the Volcker
Rule, fiduciary standards, derivatives
regulations and potential changes to loss
allocations between financial institutions and
customers, including for losses incurred from the
use of our products and services, including
electronic payments and payment of checks, that
were authorized by the customer but induced by
fraud; the impact of failures or disruptions in
or breaches of the Corporation’s operations or
information systems, or those of third parties,
including as a result of cybersecurity incidents;
the risks related to the development,
implementation, use and management of emerging
technologies, including artificial intelligence
and machine learning; the risks related to the
transition and physical impacts of climate
change; our ability to achieve environmental
goals and targets or the impact of any changes in
the Corporation’s sustainability strategy, goals
or targets; the impact of uncertain or changing
political conditions or any future federal
government shutdown and uncertainty regarding the
federal government’s debt limit or changes in
fiscal, monetary or regulatory policy; the
emergence of widespread health emergencies or
pandemics; the impact of natural disasters,
extreme weather events, military conflicts
(including the Russia/Ukraine conflict, the
conflicts in the Middle East, the possible
expansion of such conflicts and potential
geopolitical consequences), terrorism or other
geopolitical events; and other matters.
Forward-looking statements speak only as of the
date they are made, and the Corporation
undertakes no obligation to update any forward-
looking statement to reflect the impact of
circumstances or events that arise after the date
the forward-looking statement was made.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
referred to in the Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations (MD&A) are incorporated by reference
into the MD&A. Certain prior-year amounts have
been reclassified to conform to current-year
presentation. Throughout
 Bank of America26 
the MD&A, the Corporation uses certain acronyms
and abbreviations which are defined in the
Glossary. Executive Summary Business Overview The
Corporation is a Delaware corporation, a bank
holding company (BHC) and a financial holding
company. When used in this report, “Bank of
America,” “the Corporation,” “we,” “us” and “our”
may refer to Bank of America Corporation
individually, Bank of America Corporation and its
subsidiaries, or certain of Bank of America
Corporation’s subsidiaries or affiliates. Our
principal executive offices are located in
Charlotte, North Carolina. Through our various
bank and nonbank subsidiaries throughout the U.S.
and in international markets, we provide a
diversified range of banking and nonbank
financial services and products through four
business segments: Consumer Banking , Global
Wealth & Investment Management (GWIM) , Global
Banking and Global Markets , with the remaining
operations recorded in All Other . We operate our
banking activities primarily under the Bank of
America, National Association (Bank of America,
N.A. or BANA) charter. At December 31, 2024, the

Natural Disasters Certain Bank of America
communities, clients and teammates were
significantly impacted by recent wildfires in
California and by hurricanes in the southeastern
U.S. during the second half of 2024. In response,
Bank of America activated client assistance
programs, donated to disaster relief efforts and
provided additional support to teammates in the
affected areas. The Corporation continues to
evaluate the effects of the wildfires and
hurricanes on its clients and communities and
does not expect these natural disasters to have a
material impact on its businesses, results of
operations or financial condition.
Capital Management On January 29, 2025, the
Corporation’s Board of Directors (the Board)
declared a quarterly common stock dividend of
$0.26 per share, payable on March 28, 2025 to
shareholders of record as of March 7, 2025. For
more information on our capital resources, see

billion, or $3.21 per diluted share in 2024
compared to $26.5 billion, or $3.08 per diluted
share in 2023. The increase in net income was due
to higher noninterest income, partially offset by
higher provision for credit losses, higher
noninterest expense and lower net interest
income. For discussion and analysis of our
consolidated and business segment results of
operations for 2023 compared to 2022, see

Net Interest Income Net interest income decreased
$871 million to $56.1 billion in 2024 compared to
2023. Net interest yield on a fully taxable-
equivalent (FTE) basis decreased 13 basis points
(bps) to 1.95 percent for 2024. The decreases
were primarily driven by higher deposit costs,
partially offset by higher asset yields and
higher net interest income related to Global
Markets activity. For more information on net
interest yield and FTE basis, see Supplemental
Financial Data on page 30, and for more
information on interest rate risk management, see
Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking
Book on page 78. Noninterest Income

Noninterest income increased $4.2 billion to
$45.8 billion in 2024 compared to 2023. The
following highlights the significant changes. ●
Card income increased $230 million primarily due
to higher late fees, annual fees and card
transfer fees. ● Service charges increased $371
million primarily due to higher treasury service
charges. ● Investment and brokerage services
increased $2.2 billion primarily driven by higher
asset management fees due to higher average
equity market valuations and positive assets
under management (AUM) flows, as well as higher
brokerage fees due to increased transactional
volume, partially offset by the impact of lower
AUM pricing. ● Investment banking fees increased
$1.5 billion primarily due to higher debt and
equity issuance fees and higher advisory fees. ●
Market making and similar activities increased
$235 million primarily driven by the net $1.6
billion charge resulting from the Bloomberg
Short-Term Bank Yield Index’s (BSBY) cessation
announced in 2023, partially offset by lower
trading revenue from macro products in Fixed
Income, Currencies and Commodities (FICC), and
lower income from foreign currency risk
management activities. ● Other income decreased
$340 million primarily due to higher partnership
losses on tax credit investments, a charge
related to Visa Inc.’s (Visa) increase in its
litigation escrow account, and certain negative
valuation adjustments, partially offset by lower
losses on sales of available-for-sale debt
securities and gains on sales of equity
investments.
Provision for Credit Losses The provision for
credit losses increased $1.4 billion to $5.8
billion for 2024 compared to 2023. The provision
for credit losses for 2024 was primarily driven
by credit card as well as small business loan
growth, and asset quality deterioration in the
commercial real estate office and credit card
portfolios. For the prior year, the provision for
credit losses was primarily driven by credit card
loan growth and asset quality deterioration,
partially offset by improved macroeconomic
conditions that primarily benefited the
commercial portfolio. For more information on the
provision for credit losses, see Allowance for
Credit Losses on page 72. Noninterest Expense

Noninterest expense increased $967 million to

increase was primarily driven by higher revenue-
related expenses as well as investments in
people, operations and technology, partially
offset by higher Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (FDIC) expense in 2023, including
$2.1 billion for the estimated special assessment
amount arising from the closure of Silicon Valley
Bank and Signature Bank, and lower expenses
related to a liquidating business activity.

 Income tax expense 2,122 1,827 
 Effective tax rate 7.3 % 6.4 % 
The effective tax rates for 2024 and 2023 were
primarily driven by our recurring tax preference
benefits, which primarily consisted of tax
credits from investments in affordable housing
and renewable energy. Also included in the
effective tax rate for 2023 were tax impacts
related to the FDIC special assessment and BSBY’s
cessation announced in 2023. For more information
on our recurring tax preference benefits, see
Note 19 – Income Taxes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements. Absent the tax credits and
discrete tax benefits, the effective tax rates
would have been approximately 25 percent for both
periods.

 Assets 
At December 31, 2024, total assets were
approximately $3.3 trillion, up $81.4 billion
from December 31, 2023. The increase in assets
was primarily due to higher debt securities,
loans and leases, and trading account assets,
partially offset by lower cash and cash
equivalents.
 Cash and Cash Equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents decreased $43.0 billion
primarily driven by reinvestment of cash into
debt securities.
Federal Funds Sold and Securities Borrowed or
Purchased Under Agreements to Resell
Federal funds transactions involve lending
reserve balances on a short-term basis.
Securities borrowed or purchased under agreements
to resell are collateralized lending transactions
utilized to accommodate customer transactions,
earn interest rate spreads and obtain securities
for settlement and for collateral. Federal funds
sold and securities borrowed or purchased under
agreements to resell decreased $5.9 billion
primarily due to increased investments in debt
securities for balance sheet and liquidity
positioning purposes.
 Trading Account Assets 
Trading account assets consist primarily of long
positions in equity and fixed-income securities
including U.S. government and agency securities,
corporate securities and non-U.S. sovereign debt.
Trading account assets increased $37.1 billion
primarily due to client activity within Global
Markets .
 Debt Securities 
Debt securities primarily include U.S. Treasury
and agency securities, mortgage-backed securities
(MBS), principally agency MBS, non-U.S. bonds,
corporate bonds and municipal debt. We reinvest
cash in the debt securities portfolio primarily
to manage interest rate and liquidity risk. Debt
securities increased $45.9 billion primarily due
to investment of excess cash from higher
deposits. For more information on debt
securities, see Note 4 – Securities to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.
 Loans and Leases 
Loans and leases increased $42.1 billion
primarily driven by growth in commercial loans.
For more information on the loan portfolio, see
Credit Risk Management on page 58.
 Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses 
The allowance for loan and lease losses decreased
$102 million primarily due to a reserve release
in our commercial portfolio due to a favorable
macroeconomic environment and reduced exposure in
our commercial real estate portfolio. For more
information, see Allowance for Credit Losses on
page 72.
 All Other Assets 
All other assets increased $5.1 billion primarily
driven by activity within Global Markets .
 Liabilities 
At December 31, 2024, total liabilities were
approximately $3.0 trillion, up $77.5 billion
from December 31, 2023, primarily due to higher
federal funds purchased and securities loaned or
sold under agreements to repurchase, deposits,
and short-term borrowings, partially offset by
lower long-term debt.
 Deposits 
Deposits increased $41.6 billion primarily driven
by growth in commercial client balances and time
deposits.
Federal Funds Purchased and Securities Loaned or
Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase
Federal funds transactions involve borrowing
reserve balances on a short-term basis.
Securities loaned or sold under agreements to
repurchase are collateralized borrowing
transactions utilized to accommodate customer
transactions, earn interest rate spreads and
finance assets on the balance sheet. Federal
funds purchased and securities loaned or sold
under agreements to repurchase increased $47.9
billion primarily driven by client activity
within Global Markets.
 29Bank of America 
 Trading Account Liabilities 
Trading account liabilities consist primarily of
short positions in equity and fixed-income
securities including U.S. Treasury and agency
securities, non-U.S. sovereign debt and corporate
securities. Trading account liabilities decreased
$3.0 billion primarily due to lower levels of
short positions within Global Markets .
 Short-term Borrowings 
Short-term borrowings provide an additional
funding source and primarily consist of Federal
Home Loan Bank (FHLB) short-term borrowings,
notes payable and various other borrowings that
generally have maturities of one year or less.
Short-term borrowings increased $11.3 billion
primarily due to higher unsecured borrowings to
manage liquidity needs. For more information on
short-term borrowings, see Note 10 – Securities
Financing Agreements, Short-term Borrowings,
Collateral and Restricted Cash to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.
 Long-term Debt 
Long-term debt decreased $18.9 billion primarily
due to maturities and redemptions, partially
offset by debt issuances and valuation
adjustments. For more information on long-term
debt, see Note 11 – Long-term Debt to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.
 Shareholders’ Equity 
Shareholders’ equity increased $3.9 billion
primarily due to net income and market value
increases on derivatives, partially offset by
returns of capital to shareholders through common
stock repurchases and common and preferred stock
dividends, as well as preferred stock
redemptions.
 Cash Flows Overview 
The Corporation’s operating assets and
liabilities support our global markets and
lending activities. We believe that cash flows
from operations, available cash balances and our
ability to generate cash through short- and long-
term debt are sufficient to fund our operating
liquidity needs. Our investing activities
primarily include the debt securities portfolio
and loans and leases. Our financing activities
reflect cash flows primarily related to customer
deposits, securities financing agreements, long-
term debt and common and preferred stock.
 Supplemental Financial Data 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
In this Form 10-K, we present certain non-GAAP
financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures
exclude certain items or otherwise include
components that differ from the most directly
comparable measures calculated in accordance with
GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures are provided as
additional useful information to assess our
financial condition, results of operations
(including period-to-period operating
performance) or compliance with prospective
regulatory requirements. These non-GAAP financial
measures are not intended as a substitute for
GAAP financial measures and may not be defined or
calculated the same way as non-GAAP financial
measures used by other companies.
When presented on a consolidated basis, we view
net interest income on an FTE basis as a non-GAAP
financial measure. To derive the FTE basis, net
interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt
income on an equivalent before-tax basis with a
corresponding increase in income tax expense. For
purposes of this calculation, we use the federal
statutory tax rate of 21 percent and a
representative state tax rate. Net interest
yield, which measures the basis points we earn
over the cost of funds, utilizes net interest
income on an FTE basis. We believe that
presentation of these items on an FTE basis
allows for comparison of amounts from both
taxable and tax-exempt sources and is consistent
with industry practices.
We may present certain key performance indicators
and ratios excluding certain items (e.g., debit
valuation adjustment (DVA) gains (losses)), which
result in non-GAAP financial measures. We believe
that the presentation of measures that exclude
these items is useful because such measures
provide additional information to assess the
underlying operational performance and trends of
our businesses and to allow better comparison of
period-to-period operating performance.
We also evaluate our business based on certain
ratios that utilize tangible equity, a non-GAAP
financial measure. Tangible equity represents
shareholders’ equity or common shareholders’
equity reduced by goodwill and intangible assets
(excluding mortgage servicing rights (MSRs)), net
of related deferred tax liabilities (“adjusted”
shareholders’ equity or common shareholders’
equity). These measures are used to evaluate our
use of equity. In addition, profitability,
relationship and investment models use both
return on average tangible common shareholders’
equity and return on average tangible
shareholders’ equity as key measures to support
our overall growth objectives. These ratios are:
● Return on average tangible common shareholders’
equity measures our net income applicable to
common shareholders as a percentage of adjusted
average common shareholders’ equity. The tangible
common equity ratio represents adjusted ending
common shareholders’ equity divided by total
tangible assets.
● Return on average tangible shareholders’ equity
measures our net income as a percentage of
adjusted average total shareholders’ equity. The
tangible equity ratio represents adjusted ending
shareholders’ equity divided by total tangible
assets.
● Tangible book value per common share represents
adjusted ending common shareholders’ equity
divided by ending common shares outstanding.
We believe ratios utilizing tangible equity
provide additional useful information because
they present measures of those assets that can
generate income. Tangible book value per common
share provides additional useful information
about the level of tangible assets in relation to
outstanding shares of common stock.
The aforementioned supplemental data and
performance measures are presented in Tables 6
and 7.
For more information on the reconciliation of
these non-GAAP financial measures to the
corresponding GAAP financial measures, see Non-
GAAP Reconciliations on page 85.

 Key Performance Indicators 
We present certain key financial and nonfinancial
performance indicators (key performance
indicators) that management uses when assessing
our consolidated and/or segment results. We
believe they are useful to investors because they
provide additional information about our
underlying operational performance and trends.
These key performance indicators (KPIs) may not
be defined or calculated in the same way as
similar KPIs used by other companies. For
information on how these metrics are defined, see
Key Metrics on page 170.
Our consolidated key performance indicators,
which include various equity and credit metrics,
are presented in Table 1 on page 27, Table 6 on

 Business Segment Operations 
 Segment Description and Basis of Presentation 
We report our results of operations through the
following four business segments: Consumer
Banking , GWIM , Global Banking and Global
Markets , with the remaining operations recorded
in All Other . We manage our segments and report
their results on an FTE basis. The primary
activities, products and businesses of the
business segments and All Other are shown below.
We periodically review capital allocated to our
businesses and allocate capital annually during
the strategic and capital planning processes. We
utilize a methodology that considers the effect
of regulatory capital requirements in addition to
internal risk-based capital models. Our internal
risk-based capital models use a risk-adjusted
methodology incorporating each segment’s credit,
market, interest rate, business and operational
risk components. For more information on the
nature of these risks, see Managing Risk on page
45. The capital allocated to the business
segments is referred to as allocated capital.
Allocated equity in the reporting units is
comprised of allocated capital plus capital for
the portion of goodwill and intangibles
specifically assigned to the reporting unit. For
more information, including the definition of a
reporting unit, see Note 7 – Goodwill and
Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial
Statements .
For more information on our presentation of
financial information on an FTE basis, see
Supplemental Financial Data on page 30, and for
reconciliations to consolidated total revenue,
net income and year-end total assets, see Note 23
– Business Segment Information to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.
 Key Performance Indicators 
We present certain key financial and nonfinancial
performance indicators that management uses when
evaluating segment results. We believe they are
useful to investors because they provide
additional information about our segments’
operational performance, client trends and
business growth.

(1) Estimated at the segment level only.
(2) In segments and businesses where the total of
liabilities and equity exceeds assets, we
allocate assets from All Other to match the
segments’ and businesses’ liabilities and
allocated shareholders’ equity. As a result,
total earning assets and total assets of the
businesses may not equal total Consumer Banking .
Consumer Banking, comprised of Deposits and
Consumer Lending, offers a diversified range of
credit, banking and investment products and
services to consumers and small businesses.
Deposits and Consumer Lending include the net
impact of migrating customers and their related
deposit, brokerage asset and loan balances
between Deposits, Consumer Lending and GWIM , as
well as other client-managed businesses. Our
customers and clients have access to a coast-to-
coast network including financial centers in 39
states and the District of Columbia. As of
December 31, 2024, our network includes
approximately 3,700 financial centers,
approximately 15,000 ATMs, nationwide call
centers and leading digital banking platforms
with approximately 48 million active users,
including approximately 40 million active mobile
users .
 Consumer Banking Results 
Net income for Consumer Banking decreased $834
million to $10.8 billion primarily due to higher
noninterest expense and lower revenue, partially
offset by lower provision for credit losses. Net
interest income decreased $611 million to $33.1
billion primarily driven by lower deposit
balances, partially offset by higher loan
balances. Noninterest income increased $16
million to $8.4 billion, relatively unchanged
from the same period a year ago.
The provision for credit losses decreased $171
million to $5.0 billion primarily driven by lower
overdraft losses from fraud activity. Noninterest
expense increased $688 million to $22.1 billion
primarily driven by investments in the business,
including
operations, technology and people.
The return on average allocated capital was 25
percent , down from 28 percent , due to an
increase in allocated capital and lower net
income . For information on capital allocated to
the business segments, see Business Segment
Operations on page 35.
 Deposits 
Deposits includes the results of consumer deposit
activities that consist of a comprehensive range
of products provided to consumers and small
businesses. Our deposit products include
noninterest- and interest-bearing checking
accounts, money market savings accounts,
traditional savings accounts, CDs and IRAs, as
well as investment accounts and products. Net
interest income is allocated to deposit products
using our funds transfer pricing process that
matches assets and liabilities with similar
interest rate sensitivity and maturity
characteristics. Deposits generates fees such as
account service fees, non-sufficient funds fees,
overdraft charges and ATM fees, as well as
investment and brokerage fees from Consumer
Investment accounts. Consumer Investments serves
investment client relationships through the
Merrill Edge integrated investing and banking
service platform, providing investment advice and
guidance, client brokerage asset services, self-
directed online investing and key banking
capabilities including access to the
Corporation’s network of financial centers and
ATMs.
Net income for Deposits decreased $1.2 billion to
$7.5 billion primarily due to lower revenue and
higher noninterest
 Bank of America36 
expense, partially offset by lower provision for
credit losses. Net interest income decreased $1.3
billion to $21.2 billion primarily driven by
lower deposit balances . Noninterest income was
$2.8 billion, relatively unchanged from the same
period a year ago . The provision for credit
losses decreased $188 million to $303 million
primarily driven by lower overdraft losses from
fraud activity. Noninterest expense increased
$349 million to $13.7 billion primarily driven by
investments in the business, including people,
technology and operations. Average deposits
decreased $47.0 billion to $940.7 billion
primarily due to net outflows of $54.6 billion in
money market savings and $20.6 billion in
checking, partially offset by growth in time
deposits of $37.2 billion. The table below
provides key performance indicators for Deposits.
Management uses these metrics, and we believe
they are useful to investors because they provide
additional information to evaluate our deposit
profitability and digital/mobile trends.

Lending Consumer Lending offers products to
consumers and small businesses across the U.S.
The products offered include debit and credit
cards, residential mortgages and home equity
loans, and direct and indirect loans such as
automotive, recreational vehicle and consumer
personal loans. In addition to earning net
interest spread revenue on its lending
activities, Consumer Lending generates
interchange revenue from debit and credit card
transactions, late fees, cash advance fees,
annual credit card fees, mortgage banking fee
income and other miscellaneous fees. Consumer
Lending products are available to our customers
through our retail network, direct telephone, and

residential mortgages and home equity loans,
including loans held on the balance sheet of
Consumer Lending and loans serviced for others.

million to $3.2 billion primarily driven by
higher revenue, partially offset by higher
noninterest expense . Net interest income
increased $717 million to $11.9 billion primarily
due to the impact of higher loan balances.
Noninterest income increased $85 million to $5.5
billion, primarily driven by higher card income .
The provision for credit losses was $4.7 billion,
relatively unchanged from the same period a year
ago . Noninterest expense increased $339 million
to $8.4 billion primarily driven by investments
in the business, including operations, technology
and people. Average loans increased $4.9 billion
to $309.5 billion primarily driven by increases
in credit card, small business and consumer
vehicle loans. The following table provides key
performance indicators for Consumer Lending.
Management uses these metrics, and we believe
they are useful to investors because they provide
additional information about loan growth and
profitability.

GWIM consists of two primary businesses: Merrill
Wealth Management and Bank of America Private
Bank.
Merrill Wealth Management’s advisory business
provides a high-touch client experience through a
network of financial advisors focused on clients
with over $250,000 in total investable assets.
Merrill Wealth Management provides tailored
solutions to meet clients’ needs through a full
set of investment management, brokerage, banking
and retirement products.
Bank of America Private Bank, together with
Merrill Wealth Management’s Private Wealth
Management business, provides comprehensive
wealth management solutions targeted to high net
worth and ultra high net worth clients, as well
as customized solutions to meet clients’ wealth
structuring, investment management, trust and
banking needs, including specialty asset
management services.
Net income for GWIM increased $316 million to
$4.3 billion primarily due to higher revenue,
partially offset by higher noninterest expense.
The operating margin was 25 percent, unchanged
from the same period a year ago.
Net interest income decreased $178 million to
$7.0 billion primarily driven by lower average
deposit balances.
Noninterest income, which primarily includes
investment and brokerage services income,
increased $2.0 billion to $16.0 billion. The
increase was primarily driven by higher asset
management fees due to higher average equity
market
valuations and positive AUM flows, as well as
higher brokerage fees due to increased
transactional volume, partially offset by the
impact of lower AUM pricing.
Noninterest expense increased $1.4 billion to
$17.2 billion primarily due to higher revenue-
related incentives.
The return on average allocated capital was 23
percent, up from 21 percent, due to higher net
income. For information on capital allocated to
the business segments, see Business Segment
Operations on page 35.
Average loans increased $4.4 billion to $223.9
billion, primarily driven by custom lending and
residential mortgage loans. Average deposits
decreased $10.8 billion to $287.5 billion
primarily driven by clients moving deposits to
higher yielding investment cash alternatives,
including offerings on our investment and
brokerage platforms.
Merrill Wealth Management revenue of $19.1
billion increased nine percent primarily driven
by higher asset management fees due to the impact
of higher average equity market valuations and
positive AUM flows, as well as higher brokerage
fees due to increased transactional volume.
Bank of America Private Bank revenue of $3.9
billion increased six percent primarily driven by
higher asset management fees due to the impact of
higher average equity market valuations and
client flows.

 Client Balances 
Client balances managed under advisory and/or
discretion of GWIM are AUM and are typically held
in diversified portfolios. Fees earned on AUM are
calculated as a percentage of clients’ AUM
balances. The asset management fees charged to
clients per year depend on various factors but
are commonly driven by the breadth of the
client’s relationship. The net client AUM flows
represent the net change in clients’ AUM balances
over a specified period of time, excluding market
appreciation/depreciation and other adjustments.
Client balances increased $462.7 billion, or 12
percent, to $4.3 trillion at December 31, 2024
compared to December 31, 2023. The increase in
client balances was primarily due to the impact
of higher market valuations and positive net
client flows.

$13.2 billion primarily due to higher deposit
costs and lower average loan balances, partially
offset by the benefit of higher average deposit
balances.

$10.7 billion due to higher investment banking
fees and treasury service charges, partially
offset by lower leasing-related revenue.

billion to $883 million primarily driven by the
commercial real estate office portfolio compared
to a benefit in the prior year due to certain
improved macroeconomic conditions.

investments in the business, including people,
technology and operations.

Business lending revenue decreased $476 million
in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily driven by
lower net interest income and lower leasing-
related revenue, partially offset by higher tax
credit activity in affordable housing. Global
Transaction Services revenue decreased $911
million in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily driven
by higher deposit costs, partially offset by the
benefit of higher average deposit balances and
treasury service charges. Average loans and
leases of $373.1 billion decreased one percent in
2024 compared to 2023 due to lower client demand.
Average deposits of $545.8 billion increased
eight percent in 2024 compared to 2023 due to
growth in both domestic and international
balances. Global Investment Banking Client teams
and product specialists underwrite and distribute
debt, equity and loan products, and provide
advisory services and tailored risk management
solutions. The economics of certain investment
banking and underwriting activities are shared
primarily between Global Banking and Global
Markets under an internal revenue-sharing
arrangement. Global Banking originates certain
deal-related transactions with our corporate and
commercial clients that are executed and
distributed by
Global Markets . To provide a complete discussion

Global Markets offers sales and trading services
and research services to institutional clients
across fixed-income, credit, currency, commodity
and equity businesses. Global Markets product
coverage includes securities and derivative
products in both the primary and secondary
markets. Global Markets provides market-making,
financing, securities clearing, settlement and
custody services globally to our institutional
investor clients in support of their investing
and trading activities. We also work with our
commercial and corporate clients to provide risk
management products using interest rate, equity,
credit, currency and commodity derivatives,
foreign exchange, fixed-income and mortgage-
related products. As a result of our market-
making activities in these products, we may be
required to manage risk in a broad range of
financial products including government
securities, equity and equity-linked securities,
high-grade and high-yield corporate debt
securities, syndicated loans, MBS, commodities
and asset-backed securities. The economics of
certain investment banking and underwriting
activities are shared primarily between Global
Markets and Global Banking under an internal
revenue-sharing arrangement. Global Banking
originates certain deal-related transactions with
our corporate and commercial clients that are
executed and distributed by Global Markets . For
information on investment banking fees on a
consolidated basis, see page 41.
The following explanations for year-over-year
changes in results for Global Markets , including
those disclosed under Sales and Trading Revenue,
are the same for amounts including and excluding
net DVA. Amounts excluding net DVA are a non-GAAP
financial measure. For more information on net
DVA, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 30 .
Net income for Global Markets increased $944
million to $5.6 billion. Net DVA losses were $113
million compared to losses of $236 million in
2023. Excluding net DVA, net income increased
$851 million to $5.7 billion. These increases
were primarily driven by higher revenue,
partially offset by higher noninterest expense.
Revenue increased $2.3 billion to $21.8 billion
primarily due to higher sales and trading revenue
and investment banking fees. Sales and trading
revenue increased $1.4 billion, and excluding net
DVA, increased $1.3 billion. These increases were
driven by higher revenue in both Equities and
FICC. Noninterest expense increased $720 million
to $13.9 billion, primarily driven by revenue-
related expenses and continued investments in the
business, including technology.
Average total assets increased $42.0 billion to
$911.7 billion, driven by higher levels of
inventory, loan growth and increased financing
activity. Year-end total assets increased
 Bank of America42 
$59.0 billion to $876.6 billion driven by the same factors as average assets. The return on average
allocated capital was 12 percent, up from 10 percent, reflecting higher net income. For information
on capital allocated to the business segments, see Business Segment Operations on page 35. Sales and
Trading Revenue Sales and trading revenue includes unrealized and realized gains and losses on
trading and other assets that are included in market making and similar activities, net interest
income, and fees primarily from commissions on equity securities. Sales and trading revenue is
segregated into fixed-income (government debt obligations, investment and non-investment grade
corporate debt obligations, commercial MBS, residential mortgage-backed securities, collateralized
loan obligations, interest rate and credit derivative contracts), currencies (interest rate and
foreign exchange contracts), commodities (primarily futures, forwards, swaps and options) and
equities (equity-linked derivatives and cash equity activity). The following table and related
discussion present sales and trading revenue, substantially all of which is in Global Markets, with
the remainder in Global Banking . In addition, the following table and related discussion also
present sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. For more

increased $475 million and $346 million driven by
improved trading performance in mortgages.
Including and excluding net DVA, Equities revenue
increased $956 million and $962 million driven by
increased client activity and improved trading
performance in cash and derivatives.

The net loss in All Other decreased $2.3 billion
to $1.6 billion primarily due to lower
noninterest expense and higher revenue.
Noninterest income increased $999 million
primarily due to the net $1.6 billion charge
recorded in the prior year due to the
announcement of BSBY’s cessation, partially
offset by a charge related to Visa’s increase in
its litigation escrow account and certain
negative valuation adjustments.
Noninterest expense decreased $2.4 billion to
$1.7 billion primarily due to the $2.1 billion
accrual recorded in the prior year for the FDIC
special assessment resulting from the closure of
Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, and lower
expenses related to a liquidating business
activity.
The income tax benefit was $7.6 billion in 2024
compared to $8.4 billion in 2023. The decrease in
the income tax benefit was primarily due to the
benefits recorded against pretax charges in 2023
for the FDIC special assessment and the impact of
BSBY’s cessation.

 Managing Risk 
Risk is inherent in all our business activities.
Sound risk management enables us to serve our
customers and deliver for our shareholders. If
not managed well, risk can result in financial
loss, regulatory sanctions and penalties,
litigation, and damage to our reputation, each of
which may adversely impact our ability to execute
our business strategies. We take a comprehensive
approach to risk management with a defined Risk
Framework and an articulated Risk Appetite
Statement, which are approved annually by the
Board’s Enterprise Risk Committee (ERC) and the
Board.
The seven key types of risk faced by the
Corporation are strategic, credit, market,
liquidity, compliance, operational and
reputational.
● Strategic risk is the risk to current or
projected financial condition arising from
incorrect assumptions about external or internal
factors, inappropriate business plans,
ineffective business strategy execution or
failure to respond in a timely manner to changes
in the regulatory, macroeconomic or competitive
environments in the geographic locations in which
we operate.
● Credit risk is the risk of loss arising from
the inability or failure of a borrower or
counterparty to meet its obligations.
● Market risk is the risk that changes in market
conditions adversely impact the value of assets
or liabilities or otherwise negatively impact
earnings. Market risk is composed of price risk
and interest rate risk.
● Liquidity risk is the risk of the inability to
meet expected or unexpected cash flow and
collateral needs while continuing to support our
businesses and customers under a range of
economic conditions.
● Compliance risk is the risk of legal action or
regulatory sanctions, material financial loss or
damage to the reputation of the Corporation
arising from the failure of the Corporation to
comply with the requirements of applicable laws,
rules and regulations (LRRs) and our internal
policies and procedures.
● Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting
from inadequate or failed internal processes or
systems, people or external events.
● Reputational risk is the risk that negative
perception of the Corporation may adversely
impact profitability or operations.
The following sections address in more detail the
specific procedures, measures and analyses of the
major categories of risk.
As set forth in our Risk Framework, a culture of
managing risk well is fundamental to our values
and our purpose, and how we drive Responsible
Growth. It requires us to focus on risk in all
activities and encourages the necessary mindset
and behavior to enable effective risk management
and promote sound risk-taking within our risk
appetite. Sustaining a culture of managing risk
well throughout the organization is critical to
the success of the Corporation and is a clear
expectation of our executive management team and
the Board.
Our Risk Framework serves as the foundation for
the consistent and effective management of risks
facing the Corporation. The Risk Framework sets
forth roles and responsibilities for the
management of risk and provides a blueprint for
how the Board, through delegation of authority to
committees and executive officers, establishes
risk appetite and associated limits for our
activities.
Executive management assesses, with Board
oversight, the risk-adjusted returns of each
business. Management reviews and approves the
strategic and financial operating plans, as well
as the capital plan and Risk Appetite Statement,
and recommends them annually to the Board for
approval. Our strategic plan takes into
consideration return objectives and financial
resources, which must align with risk capacity
and risk appetite. Management sets financial
objectives for each business by allocating
capital and setting a target for return on
capital for each business. Capital allocations
are regularly evaluated as part of our overall
governance processes as the businesses and the
economic environment in which we operate continue
to evolve. For more information regarding capital
allocations, see Business Segment Operations on
page 35.
The Corporation’s risk appetite indicates the
amount of capital, earnings or liquidity we are
willing to put at risk to achieve our strategic
objectives and business plans, consistent with
applicable regulatory requirements. It also
provides a common framework that includes a set
of measures to assist senior management and the
Board in assessing the Corporation’s risk profile
across all risk types against our risk appetite
and risk capacity. Our risk appetite is formally
articulated in the Risk Appetite Statement, which
includes both qualitative statements and
quantitative limits.
Our overall capacity to take risk is limited.
Accordingly, we prioritize the risks we take in
order to maintain a strong and flexible financial
position so we can weather challenging economic
times and take advantage of organic growth
opportunities while complying with all applicable
regulatory requirements. Therefore, we set
objectives and targets for capital and liquidity
that permit us to continue to operate in a safe
and sound manner at all times, including during
periods of stress. We also maintain strong
operational risk management and operational
resiliency capabilities so we can meet the
expectations of our customers and clients through
a range of operating conditions.
Our lines of business operate with risk limits
that align with the Corporation’s risk appetite.
Management is responsible for tracking and
reporting performance measurements as well as any
breaches or exceptions to risk appetite limits.
The Board, and its committees when appropriate,
oversee financial performance, execution of the
strategic and financial operating plans,
adherence to risk appetite limits and the
adequacy of internal controls.
For a more detailed discussion of our risk
management activities, see the discussion below
and pages 48 through 82.
 Risk Management Governance 
The Risk Framework describes delegations of
authority whereby the Board and its committees
may delegate authority to management-level
committees or executive officers. Such
delegations may authorize certain decision-making
and approval functions, which may be evidenced in
documents such as committee charters, job
descriptions, meeting minutes and resolutions.
The chart below illustrates the interrelationship
among the Board, Board committees and management
committees that have the majority of risk
oversight responsibilities for the Corporation.
 45Bank of America 
 Board of Directors and Board Committees 
The Board is composed of 14 directors, all but
one of whom are independent. The Board authorizes
management to maintain an effective Risk
Framework and oversees compliance with safe and
sound banking practices. In addition, the Board
or its committees conduct inquiries of, and
receive reports from senior management on, risk-
related matters to assess scope or resource
limitations that could impede the ability of
Global Risk Management (GRM) and/or Corporate
Audit to execute its responsibilities. The Board
committees discussed below have the principal
responsibility for enterprise-wide oversight of
our risk management activities. Through these
activities, the Board and applicable committees
are provided with information on our risk profile
and oversee senior management addressing key
risks we face. Other Board committees, as
described below, provide additional oversight of
specific risks.
Each of the committees shown on the above chart
regularly reports to the Board on risk-related
matters within the committee’s responsibilities,
which is intended to collectively provide the
Board with integrated insight about our
management of enterprise-wide risks.
 Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee oversees the qualifications,
performance and independence of the Independent
Registered Public Accounting Firm, the
performance of our corporate audit function, the
integrity of our consolidated financial
statements, our compliance with legal and
regulatory requirements, and makes inquiries of
senior management or the Chief Audit Executive
(CAE) to determine whether there are scope or
resource limitations that impede the ability of
Corporate Audit to execute its responsibilities.
The Audit Committee is also responsible for
overseeing compliance risks pursuant to the New
York Stock Exchange listing standards.
 Enterprise Risk Committee 
The ERC oversees the Corporation’s Risk
Framework, risk appetite and senior management’s
responsibilities for the identification,
measurement, monitoring and control of key risks
facing the Corporation. The ERC may consult with
other Board committees on risk-related matters
such as the Audit Committee for compliance risks.
 Other Board Committees 
Our Corporate Governance, ESG, and Sustainability
Committee oversees corporate governance matters,
including periodically reviewing and making
recommendations to the Board on Board succession
planning and composition matters, conducting an
annual review of the Board’s performance and
leading itself and the Board’s other committees
in an annual assessment of their performance. The
committee also oversees sustainability matters
(other than human capital matters), including the
Corporation’s public policy engagement,
sustainability initiatives, charitable
contributions, and community reinvestment
activities and performance.
Our Compensation and Human Capital Committee
oversees establishing, maintaining and
administering our compensation programs and
employee benefit plans, including approving and
recommending our Chief Executive Officer’s (CEO)
compensation to our Board for further approval by
all independent directors; reviewing and
approving our executive officers’ compensation,
as well as compensation for non-management
directors; and reviewing certain other human
capital management topics.
 Management Committees 
Management committees receive their authority
from the Board, a Board committee, or another
management committee. Our primary management risk
committee is the MRC. Subject to Board oversight,
the MRC is responsible for management oversight
of key risks facing the Corporation, including an
integrated evaluation of risk, earnings, capital
and liquidity.
 Executive Officers 
Executive officers lead various functions
representing the functional roles. Authority for
functional roles may be delegated to executive
officers from the Board, Board committees or
management-level committees. Executive officers,
in turn, may further delegate responsibilities,
as appropriate, to management-level committees,
management routines or individuals. Executive
officers review our activities for consistency
with our Risk Framework, risk appetite, and
applicable strategic, capital and financial
operating plans, as well as applicable policies
and standards. Executive officers and other
employees make decisions individually on a day-
to-day basis, consistent with the authority they
have been delegated.
 Bank of America46 
Executive officers and other employees may also
serve on committees and participate in committee
decisions.
 Lines of Defense 
We have clear ownership and accountability for
managing risk across three lines of defense:
Front Line Units (FLUs), GRM and Corporate Audit.
We also have control functions outside of FLUs
and GRM (e.g., Legal and Global Human Resources).
The three lines of defense are integrated into
our management-level governance structure. Each
of these functional roles is further described in
this section.
 Front Line Units and Control Functions 
FLUs, which include the business segments and
underlying businesses, as well as the
organizations that support technology and
operations for the Corporation, are responsible
for appropriately assessing and effectively
managing all of the risks associated with their
activities. Control functions provide guidance
and subject matter expertise on day-to-day
activities affecting the Corporation, as well as
by overseeing and managing risks that emanate
from their own respective activities.
 Global Risk Management 
GRM is part of our control functions and operates
as our independent risk management function. GRM,
led by the Chief Risk Officer (CRO), is
responsible for independently assessing and
overseeing risks within FLUs and other control
functions. GRM establishes written enterprise
policies and procedures outlining how aggregate
risks are identified, measured, monitored and
controlled.
The CRO has the stature, authority and
independence needed to develop and implement a
meaningful risk management framework and
practices to guide the Corporation in managing
risk. The CRO has unrestricted access to the
Board and reports directly to both the ERC and
the CEO. GRM is organized into horizontal risk
teams that cover a specific risk area and
vertical CRO teams that cover a particular FLU or
control function. These teams work
collaboratively in executing their respective
duties.
 Corporate Audit 
Corporate Audit and the CAE maintain their
independence from the FLUs, GRM and other control
functions by reporting directly to the Audit
Committee. The CAE administratively reports to
the CEO. Corporate Audit provides independent
assessment and validation through testing of key
processes and controls across the Corporation.
Corporate Audit includes Credit Review, which
provides an independent assessment of credit
lending decisions and the effectiveness of credit
processes across the Corporation’s credit
platform through examinations and monitoring.
 Risk Management Processes 
The Risk Framework requires that strong risk
management practices are integrated in key
strategic, capital and financial planning
processes and in day-to-day business processes
across the Corporation, thereby ensuring risks
are appropriately considered, evaluated and
responded to in a timely manner. We employ an
effective risk management process, referred to as
Identify, Measure, Monitor and Control, as part
of our daily activities.
Identify – To be effectively managed, risks must
be proactively identified and well understood.
Proper risk identification focuses on recognizing
and understanding key risks inherent in our
business activities or key risks that may arise
from
external factors. Each employee is expected to
identify and escalate risks promptly. Risk
identification is an ongoing process that
incorporates input from FLUs and control
functions. It is designed to be forward-looking
and to capture relevant risk factors across all
of our lines of business.
Measure – Once a risk is identified, it must be
prioritized and accurately measured through a
systematic process including qualitative
statements and quantitative limits. Risk is
measured at various levels, including, but not
limited to, risk type, FLU and legal entity, and
also on an aggregate basis. This risk measurement
process helps to capture changes in our risk
profile due to changes in strategic direction,
concentrations, portfolio quality and the overall
economic environment. Senior management considers
how risk exposures might evolve under a variety
of stress scenarios.
Monitor – We monitor risk levels regularly to
track adherence to risk appetite, policies and
standards. We also regularly update risk
assessments and review risk exposures. Through
our monitoring, we know our level of risk
relative to limits and can take action in a
timely manner. We also know when risk limits are
breached and have processes to appropriately
report and escalate exceptions. This includes
timely requests for approval to managers and
alerts to executive management, management-level
committees or the Board (directly or through an
appropriate committee).
Control – We establish and communicate risk
limits and controls through policies, standards,
procedures and processes. The limits and controls
can be adjusted by senior management or the Board
when conditions or risk tolerances warrant. These
limits may be absolute (e.g., loan amount,
trading volume, operational loss) or relative
(e.g., percentage of loan book in higher-risk
categories). Our FLUs are held accountable for
performing within the established limits.
The formal processes used to manage risk
represent a part of our overall risk management
process. We instill a strong and comprehensive
culture of managing risk well through
communications, training, policies, procedures
and organizational roles and responsibilities.
Establishing a culture reflective of our purpose
to help make our customers’ financial lives
better and delivering on Responsible Growth is
also critical to effective risk management. We
are committed to the highest principles of
ethical and professional conduct. Conduct risk is
the risk of improper actions, behaviors or
practices by the Corporation, its employees or
representatives that are illegal, unethical
and/or contrary to our core values that could
result in harm to the Corporation, our
shareholders or our customers, damage the
integrity of the financial markets, or negatively
impact our reputation. We have established
protocols and structures so that conduct risk is
governed and reported across the Corporation
appropriately. All employees are held accountable
for adhering to the Code of Conduct, operating
within our risk appetite and managing risk in
their daily business activities. In addition, our
performance management and compensation practices
encourage responsible risk-taking that is
consistent with our Risk Framework and risk
appetite.
 Corporation-wide Stress Testing 
Integral to our Capital Planning, Financial
Planning and Strategic Planning processes, we
conduct capital scenario management and stress
forecasting on a regular basis to better
understand balance sheet, earnings and capital
sensitivities to a wide range of economic and
business scenarios, including economic and market
conditions that are more severe than anticipated.
These stress forecasts provide an understanding
of the potential
 47Bank of America 
impacts from our risk profile on the balance
sheet, earnings and capital, and serve as a key
component of our capital and risk management
practices. The intent of stress testing is to
develop a comprehensive understanding of
potential impacts of on- and off-balance sheet
risks at the Corporation and certain subsidiaries
and how they impact financial resiliency, which
provides confidence to management, regulators and
our investors.
 Contingency Planning 
We have developed and maintain comprehensive
contingency plans that are designed to prepare us
in advance to respond in the event of potential
adverse economic, operational, financial or
market stress conditions. These contingency plans
include our Financial Contingency and Recovery
Plan, which provides monitoring, escalation,
actions and routines designed to enable us to
increase capital and/or liquidity, access funding
sources and reduce risk through consideration of
potential options that include asset sales,
business sales, capital or debt issuances, and
other risk reducing strategies at various levels
of capital or liquidity depletion during a period
of stress. We also maintain a Resolution Plan to
limit adverse systemic impacts that could be
associated with a potential resolution of Bank of
America.
 Strategic Risk Management 
Strategic risk is embedded in every business and
is one of the major risk categories along with
credit, market, liquidity, compliance,
operational and reputational risks. This risk
results from incorrect assumptions about external
or internal factors, inappropriate business
plans, ineffective business strategy execution,
or failure to respond in a timely manner to
changes in the regulatory, macroeconomic or
competitive environments in the geographic
locations in which we operate, such as competitor
actions, changing customer preferences, product
obsolescence and technology developments,
including rapid advances in artificial
intelligence (AI), such as machine learning and
generative AI.
An aspect of strategic risk is the risk that the
Corporation’s capital levels are not adequate to
meet minimum regulatory requirements and support
execution of business activities or absorb losses
from risks during normal or adverse economic and
market conditions. As such, capital risk is
managed in parallel to strategic risk.
We manage strategic risk through the Strategic
Risk Enterprise Policy and integration into the
strategic planning process, among other
activities. Our strategic plan is consistent with
our risk appetite, capital plan and liquidity
requirements, and specifically addresses
strategic risks impacting each business.
On an annual basis, the Board reviews and
approves the strategic plan, capital plan,
financial operating plan and Risk Appetite
Statement. With oversight by the Board, senior
management directs the lines of business to
execute our strategic plan consistent with our
core operating principles and risk appetite. The
executive management team monitors business
performance throughout the year and provides the
Board with regular progress reports on whether
strategic objectives and timelines are being met,
including reports on strategic risks and if
additional or alternative actions need to be
considered or implemented. The regular executive
reviews focus on assessing forecasted earnings
and returns on capital, the current risk profile,
current capital and liquidity requirements,
staffing levels and changes required to support
the strategic plan, stress testing results, and
other qualitative factors such as market growth
rates and peer analysis.
Significant strategic actions, such as capital
actions, material acquisitions or divestitures,
and resolution plans are reviewed and approved by
the Board. At the business level, processes are
in place to discuss the strategic risk
implications of new, expanded or modified
businesses, products or services, regulatory
change and other strategic initiatives, and to
provide formal review and approval where
required. With oversight by the Board and the
ERC, executive management performs similar
analyses throughout the year, and evaluates
changes to the financial forecast or the risk,
capital or liquidity positions as deemed
appropriate to balance and optimize achieving the
targeted risk appetite, shareholder returns and
maintaining the targeted financial strength.
Proprietary models are used to measure the
capital requirements for credit, country, market,
operational and strategic risks. The allocated
capital assigned to each business is based on its
unique risk profile. With oversight by the Board,
executive management assesses the risk-adjusted
returns of each business in approving strategic
and financial operating plans. The businesses use
allocated capital to define business strategies,
and price products and transactions.
 Capital Management 
The Corporation manages its capital position so
that its capital is more than adequate to support
its business activities and aligns with risk,
risk appetite and strategic planning.
Additionally, we seek to maintain safety and
soundness at all times, even under adverse
scenarios, take advantage of organic growth
opportunities, meet obligations to creditors and
counterparties, maintain ready access to
financial markets, continue to serve as a credit
intermediary, remain a source of strength for our
subsidiaries, and satisfy current and future
regulatory capital requirements. Capital
management is integrated into our risk and
governance processes, as capital is a key
consideration in the development of our strategic
plan, risk appetite and risk limits.
We conduct an Internal Capital Adequacy
Assessment Process (ICAAP) on a periodic basis.
The ICAAP is a forward-looking assessment of our
projected capital needs and resources,
incorporating earnings, balance sheet and risk
forecasts under baseline and adverse economic and
market conditions. We utilize periodic stress
tests to assess the potential impacts to our
balance sheet, earnings, regulatory capital and
liquidity under a variety of stress scenarios. We
perform qualitative risk assessments to identify
and assess material risks not fully captured in
our forecasts or stress tests. We assess the
potential capital impacts of proposed changes to
regulatory capital requirements. Management
assesses ICAAP results and provides documented
quarterly assessments of the adequacy of our
capital guidelines and capital position to the
Board or its committees.
We periodically review capital allocated to our
businesses and allocate capital annually during
the strategic and capital planning processes. For
more information, see Business Segment Operations
on page 35.
 CCAR and Capital Planning 
The Federal Reserve requires BHCs to submit a
capital plan and planned capital actions on an
annual basis, consistent with the rules governing
capital planning and the stress capital buffer
(SCB) requirement, which include supervisory
stress testing by the Federal Reserve. Based on
2024 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review
(CCAR) stress test results, our SCB is 3.2
percent effective from October 1, 2024 through
September 30, 2025.
 Bank of America48 
On July 24, 2024, the Board authorized a $25
billion common stock repurchase program,
effective August 1, 2024, which replaced the
Corporation’s previous program that was initially
authorized by the Board in 2021, modified in 2023
and expired on August 1, 2024.
Pursuant to Board authorizations, during 2024 we
repurchased $13.1 billion of common stock. For
more information, see Part II, Item 5. Market for
Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder
Matters and issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
on page 24.
The timing and amount of common stock repurchases
are subject to various factors, including the
Corporation’s capital position, liquidity,
financial performance and alternative uses of
capital, stock trading price, regulatory
requirements and general market conditions, and
may be suspended at any time. Such repurchases
may be effected through open market purchases or
privately negotiated transactions, including
repurchase plans that satisfy the conditions of
Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (Exchange Act).
 Regulatory Capital 
As a BHC, we are subject to regulatory capital
rules, including Basel 3, issued by U.S. banking
regulators. Basel 3 established minimum capital
ratios and buffer requirements and outlined two
methods of calculating risk-weighted assets
(RWA), the Standardized approach and the Advanced
approaches. The Standardized approach relies
primarily on supervisory risk weights based on
exposure type, and the Advanced approaches
determine risk weights based on internal models.
The Corporation's depository institution
subsidiaries are also subject to the Prompt
Corrective Action (PCA) framework. The
Corporation and its primary affiliated banking
entity, BANA, are Advanced approaches
institutions under Basel 3 and are required to
report regulatory risk-based capital ratios and
RWA under both the Standardized and Advanced
approaches. The lower of the capital ratios under
Standardized or Advanced approaches compared to
their respective regulatory capital ratio
requirements is used to assess capital adequacy,
including under the PCA framework. As of December
31, 2024, the Common equity tier 1 (CET1)
capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios
under the Standardized approach were the binding
ratios.
 Minimum Capital Requirements 
In order to avoid restrictions on capital
distributions and discretionary bonus payments to
executive officers, the Corporation must meet
risk-based capital ratio requirements that
include a capital conservation buffer of 2.5
percent (under the Advanced approaches only), an
SCB (under the Standardized
approach only), plus any applicable
countercyclical capital buffer and a global
systemically important bank (G-SIB) surcharge.
The buffers and surcharge must be comprised
solely of CET1 capital. For the period from
January 1, 2024 through September 30, 2024, the
Corporation's minimum CET1 capital ratio
requirements were 10.0 percent under both the
Standardized approach and the Advanced
approaches. Effective October 1, 2024, the
Corporation’s minimum CET1 requirements were 10.7
percent under the Standardized approach and 10.0
percent under the Advanced approaches.
The Corporation is required to calculate its
G-SIB surcharge on an annual basis under two
methods and is subject to the higher of the
resulting two surcharges. Method 1 is consistent
with the approach prescribed by the Basel
Committee’s assessment methodology and is
calculated using specified indicators of systemic
importance. Method 2 modifies the Method 1
approach by, among other factors, including a
measure of the Corporation’s reliance on short-
term wholesale funding. The Corporation’s G-SIB
surcharge, which is higher under Method 2, is
expected to increase to 3.5 percent from 3.0
percent on January 1, 2027, unless its surcharge
calculated as of December 31, 2025 is lower than
3.5 percent. At December 31, 2024, the
Corporation’s CET1 capital ratio of 11.9 percent
under the Standardized approach exceeded its CET1
capital ratio requirement.
The Corporation is also required to maintain a
minimum supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) of 3.0
percent plus a leverage buffer of 2.0 percent in
order to avoid certain restrictions on capital
distributions and discretionary bonus payments to
executive officers. At December 31, 2024, our
insured depository institution subsidiaries
exceeded their requirement to maintain a minimum
6.0 percent SLR to be considered well capitalized
under the PCA framework. The numerator of the SLR
is quarter-end Basel 3 Tier 1 capital. The
denominator is total leverage exposure based on
the daily average of the sum of on-balance sheet
exposures less permitted deductions and the
simple average of certain off-balance sheet
exposures, as of the end of each month in a
quarter.
 Capital Composition and Ratios 
Table 10 presents Bank of America Corporation’s
capital ratios and related information in
accordance with Basel 3 Standardized and Advanced
approaches as measured at December 31, 2024 and
2023. For the periods presented herein, the
Corporation met the definition of well
capitalized under current regulatory
requirements.

(1) Capital ratios as of December 31, 2024 and
2023 are calculated using the regulatory capital
rule that allows a five-year transition period
related to the adoption of the current expected
credit losses (CECL) accounting standard on
January 1, 2020.
(2) The CET1 capital regulatory minimum is the
sum of the CET1 capital ratio minimum of 4.5
percent, our G-SIB surcharge of 3.0 percent at
December 31, 2024 and 2.5 percent at December 31,
2023, and SCB (under the Standardized approach)
of 3.2 percent at December 31, 2024 and 2.5
percent at December 31, 2023. The countercyclical
capital buffer was zero for both periods. The SLR
regulatory minimum includes a leverage buffer of
2.0 percent.
(3) Total capital under the Advanced approaches
differs from the Standardized approach due to
differences in the amount permitted in Tier 2
capital related to the qualifying allowance for
credit losses.
(4) Reflects total average assets adjusted for
certain Tier 1 capital deductions.
At December 31, 2024, CET1 capital was $201.1
billion, an increase of $6.2 billion from
December 31, 2023, primarily due to earnings,
partially offset by capital distributions. Tier 1
capital increased $135 million primarily driven
by the increase in CET1 capital, partially offset
by preferred stock redemptions. Total capital
under the Standardized approach increased $4.0
billion primarily due to an increase in
subordinated debt, adjusted allowance for credit
losses included in Tier 2 capital, and the
increase in Tier 1 capital. RWA under the
Standardized approach, which yielded the lower
CET1 capital ratio at December 31, 2024,
increased $44.5 billion during 2024 to $1,696
billion primarily driven by client activity in
Global Markets and lending activity in GWIM,
Global Banking and Consumer Banking .
Supplementary leverage exposure at December 31,
2024 increased $142.0 billion primarily driven by
increased activity in Global Markets and ALM
activities in All Other.

(1) Capital ratios as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 are calculated using the regulatory capital rule
that allows a five-year transition period related to the adoption of the CECL accounting standard on
January 1, 2020.
(2) Risk-based capital regulatory minimums at both December 31, 2024 and 2023 are the minimum ratios
under Basel 3 including a capital conservation buffer of 2.5 percent. The regulatory minimums for the
leverage ratios as of both period ends are the percent required to be considered well capitalized
under the PCA framework.
(3) Total capital under the Advanced approaches differs from the Standardized approach due to
differences in the amount permitted in Tier 2 capital related to the qualifying allowance for credit
losses.
(4) Reflects total average assets adjusted for certain Tier 1 capital deductions.
 Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity Requirements 
Total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) consists of
the Corporation’s Tier 1 capital and eligible
long-term debt issued directly by the
Corporation. Eligible long-term debt for TLAC
ratios is comprised of unsecured debt that has a
remaining maturity of at least one year and
satisfies additional requirements as prescribed
in the TLAC final rule. As with the
risk-based capital ratios and SLR, the
Corporation is required to maintain TLAC ratios
in excess of minimum requirements plus applicable
buffers to avoid restrictions on capital
distributions and discretionary bonus payments to
executive officers. Table 14 presents the
Corporation's TLAC and long-term debt ratios and

(1) As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, TLAC ratios are calculated using the regulatory capital rule
that allows a five-year transition period related to the adoption of the CECL accounting standard on
January 1, 2020.
(2) The TLAC RWA regulatory minimum consists of 18.0 percent plus a TLAC RWA buffer comprised of 2.5
percent plus the Method 1 G-SIB surcharge of 1.5 percent. The countercyclical buffer is zero for both
periods. The TLAC supplementary leverage exposure regulatory minimum consists of 7.5 percent plus a
2.0 percent TLAC leverage buffer. The TLAC RWA and leverage buffers must be comprised solely of CET1
capital and Tier 1 capital, respectively.
(3) The long-term debt RWA regulatory minimum is comprised of 6.0 percent plus the Corporation’s
G-SIB surcharge of 3.0 percent at December 31, 2024 and 2.5 percent at December 31, 2023. The long-
term debt leverage exposure regulatory minimum is 4.5 percent. Effective January 1, 2024, the
Corporation’s G-SIB surcharge, which is higher under Method 2, increased 50 bps, resulting in an
increase in our long-term debt RWA regulatory minimum requirement to 9.0 percent from 8.5 percent.
(4) The approach that yields the higher RWA is used to calculate TLAC and long-term debt ratios,
which was the Standardized approach as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.
 Regulatory Capital and Securities Regulation 
The Corporation’s principal U.S. broker-dealer
subsidiaries are BofA Securities, Inc. (BofAS)
and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith
Incorporated (MLPF&S). The Corporation's
principal European subsidiaries undertaking
broker-dealer activities are Merrill Lynch
International (MLI) and BofA Securities Europe SA
(BofASE).
The U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject
to the net capital requirements of Rule 15c3-1
under the Exchange Act. BofAS computes its
capital requirements as an alternative net
capital broker-dealer under Rule 15c3-1e, and
MLPF&S computes its capital requirements in
accordance with the alternative standard under
Rule 15c3-1. BofAS is registered as a futures
commission merchant and is subject to Commodity
Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Regulation
1.17. The U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are
also registered with the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA). Pursuant to
FINRA Rule 4110, FINRA may impose higher net
capital requirements than Rule 15c3-1 under the
Exchange Act with respect to each of the broker-
dealers.
BofAS provides institutional services, and in
accordance with the alternative net capital
requirements, is required to maintain tentative
net capital in excess of $5.0 billion and net
capital in excess of the greater of $1.0 billion
or a certain percentage of its reserve
requirement in addition to a certain percentage
of securities-based swap risk margin. BofAS must
also notify the SEC in the event its tentative
net capital is less than $6.0 billion. BofAS is
also required to hold a certain percentage of its
customers' and affiliates' risk-based margin in
order to meet its CFTC minimum net capital
requirement. At December 31, 2024, BofAS had
tentative net capital of $23.6 billion. BofAS
also had regulatory net capital of $21.0 billion,
which exceeded the minimum requirement of $4.5
billion.
MLPF&S provides retail services. At December 31,
2024, MLPF&S' regulatory net capital was $7.2
billion, which exceeded the minimum requirement
of $155 million.
Our European broker-dealers are subject to
requirements from U.S. and non-U.S. regulators.
MLI, a U.K. investment firm, is regulated by the
Prudential Regulation Authority and the Financial
Conduct Authority and is subject to certain
regulatory capital requirements. At December 31,
2024, MLI’s capital resources were $33.8 billion,
which exceeded the minimum Pillar 1 requirement
of $11.0 billion.
BofASE, an authorized credit institution with its
head office located in France, is regulated by
the Autorité de Contrôle
Prudentiel et de Résolution and the Autorité des
Marchés Financiers, and supervised under the
Single Supervisory Mechanism by the European
Central Bank. At December 31, 2024, BofASE's
capital resources were $10.9 billion, which
exceeded the minimum Pillar 1 requirement of $3.3
billion.
In addition, MLI and BofASE remained
conditionally registered with the SEC as
security-based swap dealers, and maintained net
liquid assets at December 31, 2024 that exceeded
the applicable minimum requirements under the
Exchange Act. The entities are also registered as
swap dealers with the CFTC and met applicable
capital requirements at December 31, 2024.
 Liquidity Risk 
 Funding and Liquidity Risk Management 
Our primary liquidity risk management objective
is to meet expected or unexpected cash flow and
collateral requirements, including payments under
long-term debt agreements, commitments to extend
credit and customer deposit withdrawals, while
continuing to support our businesses and
customers under a range of economic conditions.
To achieve that objective, we analyze and monitor
our liquidity risk under expected and stressed
conditions, maintain liquidity and access to
diverse funding sources, including our stable
deposit base, and seek to align liquidity-related
incentives and risks. These liquidity risk
management practices have allowed us to
effectively manage market fluctuations from the
elevated interest rate environment, inflationary
pressures and changes in the macroeconomic
environment.
We define liquidity as readily available assets,
limited to cash and high-quality, liquid,
unencumbered securities that we can use to meet
our contractual and contingent financial
obligations as they arise. We manage our
liquidity position through line-of-business and
ALM activities, as well as through our legal
entity funding strategy, on both a forward and
current (including intraday) basis under both
expected and stressed conditions. We believe that
a centralized approach to funding and liquidity
management enhances our ability to monitor
liquidity requirements, maximizes access to
funding sources, minimizes borrowing costs and
facilitates timely responses to liquidity events.
We provide centralized funding and liquidity
management through a variety of activities,
including monitoring of
 53Bank of America 
established limits and liquidity risk appetites,
reviews of liquidity risk management controls and
production, and reviews of regulatory and
internally defined liquidity risk metrics. In
addition, GRM provides oversight of centralized
liquidity and funding management as well as
oversight of liquidity management across FLUs and
legal entities. GRM oversees the liquidity risk
management governance structure, establishes
liquidity risk policies, reports and monitors
liquidity risk limits and provides review and
challenge of the Corporation's liquidity risk
management processes. The Board, its risk
committee and various management committees
oversee the Corporation’s liquidity activities
and risk governance. The Board and/or ERC approve
our liquidity risk policy, Financial Contingency
and Recovery Plan and liquidity risk appetite
limits. Management committees responsible for
liquidity governance include the Corporation’s
Management Risk Committee, Asset and Liability
Governance Committee, Liquidity Risk Committee
and Asset and Liability Management Investment
Committee. For more information, see Managing
Risk on page 45. Under this governance framework,
we developed certain funding and liquidity risk
management practices which include: maintaining
liquidity at Bank of America Corporation (Parent)
and selected subsidiaries, including our bank
subsidiaries and other regulated entities;
determining what amounts of liquidity are
appropriate for these entities based on analysis
of debt maturities and other potential cash
outflows, including those that we may experience
during stressed market conditions; diversifying
funding sources, considering our asset profile
and legal entity structure; and performing
contingency planning. NB Holdings Corporation
Bank of America Corporation, as the parent
company (Parent), which is a separate and
distinct legal entity from our bank and nonbank
subsidiaries, has an intercompany arrangement
with our wholly-owned holding company subsidiary,
NB Holdings Corporation (NB Holdings). We have
transferred, and agreed to transfer, additional
Parent assets not required to satisfy anticipated
near-term expenditures to NB Holdings. The Parent
is expected to continue to have access to the
same flow of dividends, interest and other
amounts of cash necessary to service its debt,
pay dividends and perform other obligations as it
would have had it not entered into these
arrangements and transferred any assets. These
arrangements support our preferred single point
of entry resolution strategy, under which only
the Parent would be resolved under the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code. In consideration for the
transfer of assets, NB Holdings issued a
subordinated note to the Parent in a principal
amount equal to the value of the transferred
assets. The aggregate principal amount of the
note will increase by the amount of any future
asset transfers. NB Holdings also provided the
Parent with a committed line of credit that
allows the Parent to draw funds necessary to
service near-term cash needs. These arrangements
support our preferred single point of entry
resolution strategy, under which only the Parent
would be resolved under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
These arrangements include provisions to
terminate the line of credit, forgive the
subordinated note and require the Parent to
transfer its remaining financial assets to NB
Holdings if our projected liquidity resources
deteriorate so severely that resolution of the
Parent becomes imminent. Global Liquidity Sources
and Other Unencumbered Assets We maintain
liquidity available to the Corporation, including
the Parent and selected subsidiaries, in the form
of cash and high- quality, liquid, unencumbered
securities. Our liquidity buffer,
referred to as Global Liquidity Sources (GLS), is
comprised of assets that are readily available to
the Parent and selected subsidiaries, including
holding company, bank and broker-dealer
subsidiaries, even during stressed market
conditions. Our cash is primarily on deposit with
the Federal Reserve Bank and, to a lesser extent,
central banks outside of the U.S. We limit the
composition of high-quality, liquid, unencumbered
securities to U.S. government securities, U.S.
agency securities, U.S. agency mortgage-backed
securities and other investment-grade securities,
and a select group of non-U.S. government
securities. We can obtain cash for these
securities, even in stressed conditions, through
repurchase agreements or outright sales. We hold
our GLS in legal entities that allow us to meet
the liquidity requirements of our global
businesses, and we consider the impact of
potential regulatory, tax, legal and other
restrictions that could limit the transferability
of funds among entities. Table 15 presents
average GLS for the three months ended December
31, 2024 and 2023.

(1) Nonbank includes Parent, NB Holdings and
other regulated entities. Our bank subsidiaries’
liquidity is primarily driven by deposit and
lending activity, as well as securities valuation
and net debt activity. Bank subsidiaries can also
generate incremental liquidity by pledging a
range of unencumbered loans and securities to
certain FHLBs and the Federal Reserve Discount
Window. The cash we could have obtained by
borrowing against this pool of specifically-
identified eligible assets was $328 billion and
$312 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023. We
have established operational procedures to enable
us to borrow against these assets, including
regularly monitoring our total pool of eligible
loans and securities collateral. Eligibility is
defined in guidelines from the FHLBs and the
Federal Reserve and is subject to change at their
discretion. Due to regulatory restrictions,
liquidity generated by the bank subsidiaries can
generally be used only to fund obligations within
the bank subsidiaries, and transfers to the
Parent or nonbank subsidiaries may be subject to
prior regulatory approval. Liquidity is also held
in nonbank entities, including the Parent, NB
Holdings and other regulated entities. The Parent
and NB Holdings liquidity is typically in the
form of cash deposited at BANA, which is excluded
from the liquidity at bank subsidiaries, and
high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities.
Liquidity held in other regulated entities,
comprised primarily of broker-dealer
subsidiaries, is primarily available to meet the
obligations of that entity, and transfers to the
Parent or to any other subsidiary may be subject
to prior regulatory approval due to regulatory
restrictions and minimum requirements. Our other
regulated entities also hold unencumbered
investment-grade securities and equities that we
believe could be used to generate additional
liquidity. Table 16 presents the composition of
average GLS for the three months ended December

Our GLS are substantially the same in composition to what qualifies as High Quality Liquid Assets
(HQLA) under the final U.S. Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) rules. However, HQLA for purposes of
calculating LCR is not reported at market value, but at a lower value that incorporates regulatory
deductions and the exclusion of excess liquidity held at certain subsidiaries. The LCR is calculated
as the amount of a financial institution’s unencumbered HQLA relative to the estimated net cash
outflows the institution could encounter over a 30-day period of significant liquidity stress,
expressed as a percentage. Our average consolidated HQLA, on a net basis, was $623 billion and $590
billion for the three months ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. For the same periods, the average
consolidated LCR was 113 percent and 115 percent. Our LCR fluctuates due to normal business flows
from customer activity. Liquidity Stress Analysis We utilize liquidity stress analysis to assist us
in determining the appropriate amounts of liquidity to maintain at the Parent and our subsidiaries to
meet contractual and contingent cash outflows under a range of scenarios. The scenarios we consider
and utilize incorporate market-wide and Corporation-specific events, including potential credit
rating downgrades for the Parent and our subsidiaries, and more severe events including potential
resolution scenarios. The scenarios are based on our historical experience, experience of distressed
and failed financial institutions, regulatory guidance, and both expected and unexpected future
events. The types of potential contractual and contingent cash outflows we consider in our scenarios
may include, but are not limited to, upcoming contractual maturities of unsecured debt and reductions
in new debt issuances; diminished access to secured financing markets; potential deposit withdrawals;
increased draws on loan commitments, liquidity facilities and letters of credit; additional
collateral that counterparties could call if our credit ratings were downgraded; collateral and
margin requirements arising from market value changes; and potential liquidity required to maintain
businesses and finance customer activities. Changes in certain market factors, including, but not
limited to, credit rating downgrades, could negatively impact potential contractual and contingent
outflows and the related financial instruments, and in some cases these impacts could be material to
our financial results. We consider all sources of funds that we could access during each stress
scenario and focus particularly on matching available sources with corresponding liquidity
requirements by legal entity. We also use the stress modeling results to manage our asset and
liability profile and establish limits and guidelines on certain funding sources and businesses. Net
Stable Funding Ratio The Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) is a liquidity requirement for large banks
to maintain a minimum level of stable funding
over a one-year period. The requirement is intended to support the ability of banks to lend to
households and businesses in both normal and adverse economic conditions and is complementary to the
LCR, which focuses on short-term liquidity risks. The U.S. NSFR applies to the Corporation on a
consolidated basis and to our insured depository institutions. For the three months ended September
30, 2024 and December 31, 2024, the average consolidated NSFR was 121 percent and 119 percent.
Diversified Funding Sources We fund our assets primarily with a mix of deposits, and secured and
unsecured liabilities through a centralized, globally coordinated funding approach diversified across
products, programs, markets, currencies and investor groups. The primary benefits of our centralized
funding approach include greater control, reduced funding costs, wider name recognition by investors
and greater flexibility to meet the variable funding requirements of subsidiaries. Where regulations,
time zone differences or other business considerations make Parent funding impractical, certain other
subsidiaries may issue their own debt. We fund a substantial portion of our lending activities
through our deposits, which were $1.97 trillion and $1.92 trillion at December 31, 2024 and 2023 .
Deposits are primarily generated by our Consumer Banking, GWIM and Global Banking segments. These
deposits are diversified by clients, product type and geography, and the majority of our U.S.
deposits are insured by the FDIC. At December 31, 2024, 48 percent of our deposits were in Consumer
Banking , 15 percent in GWIM and 29 percent in Global Banking . As of the same period, approximately
68 percent of consumer and small business deposits and 79 percent of U.S. deposits in Global Banking
were held by clients who have had accounts with us for 10 or more years. In addition, at December 31,
2024 and 2023, 27 percent and 28 percent of our deposits were noninterest bearing and included
operating accounts of our consumer and commercial clients. During the three months ended December 31,
2024 and 2023, rates paid on deposits were 64 bps and 47 bps in Consumer Banking , 275 bps and 287
bps in GWIM , and 297 bps and 296 bps in Global Bankin g. For information on annual rates paid on
consolidated deposit balances, see Table 8 on page 33 . We consider a substantial portion of our
deposit base to be a stable, low-cost and consistent source of funding. We believe this deposit
funding is generally less sensitive to interest rate changes, market volatility or changes in our
credit ratings than wholesale funding sources. Our lending activities may also be financed through
secured borrowings, including credit card securitizations and securitizations with government-
sponsored enterprises (GSE), the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and private-label investors, as
well as FHLB loans. Our trading activities in other regulated entities are primarily funded on a
secured basis through securities lending and repurchase agreements, and these amounts will vary based
on customer activity and market conditions. We believe funding these activities in the secured
financing markets is more cost-efficient and less sensitive to changes in our credit ratings than
unsecured financing. Repurchase agreements are generally short-term and often overnight. Disruptions
in secured financing markets for financial institutions have occurred in prior market cycles which
resulted in adverse changes in terms or significant reductions in the availability of such financing.
We manage the liquidity risks arising from secured funding by sourcing funding globally from a
diverse group of counterparties, providing a
 55Bank of America 
range of securities collateral and pursuing
longer durations, when appropriate. For more
information on secured financing agreements, see
Note 10 – Securities Financing Agreements, Short-
term Borrowings, Collateral and Restricted Cash
to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Total
long-term debt decreased $18.9 billion to $283.3
billion during 2024, primarily due to maturities
and redemptions, partially offset by debt
issuances and valuation adjustments. We may, from
time to time, purchase outstanding debt
instruments in various transactions, depending on
market conditions, liquidity and other factors.
Our other regulated entities may also make
markets in our debt instruments to provide
liquidity for investors. At December 31, 2024,
Bank of America Corporation's senior notes of
$180.3 billion included $167.5 billion of
outstanding notes, substantially all of which are
both TLAC eligible and callable at least one year
before their stated maturities. Of these senior
notes, $22.1 billion will be callable and become
TLAC ineligible during 2025 , and $21.6 billion ,
$24.9 billion , $19.5 billion and $8.0 billion
will do so during each of 2026 through 2029 ,
respectively, and $71.4 billion thereafter. We
issue long-term unsecured debt in a variety of
maturities and currencies to achieve cost-
efficient funding and to maintain an appropriate
maturity profile. While the cost and availability
of unsecured funding may be negatively impacted
by general market conditions or by matters
specific to the financial services industry or
the Corporation, we seek to mitigate refinancing
risk by actively managing the amount of our
borrowings that we anticipate will mature within
any month or quarter. We may issue unsecured debt
in the form of structured notes for client
purposes, certain of which qualify as TLAC-
eligible debt. During 2024, we issued $28.2
billion of structured notes, which are debt
obligations that pay investors returns linked to
other debt or equity securities, indices,
currencies or commodities. We typically hedge the
returns we are obligated to pay on these
liabilities with derivatives and/or investments
in the underlying instruments, so that from a
funding perspective, the cost is similar to our
other unsecured long-term debt. We could be
required to settle certain structured note
obligations for cash or other securities prior to
maturity under certain circumstances, which we
consider for liquidity planning purposes. We
believe, however, that a portion of such
borrowings will remain outstanding beyond the
earliest put or redemption date. Substantially
all of our senior and subordinated debt
obligations contain no provisions that could
trigger a requirement for an early repayment,
require additional collateral support, result in
changes to terms, accelerate maturity or create
additional financial obligations upon an adverse
change in our credit ratings, financial ratios,
earnings, cash flows or stock price. For more
information on long-term debt funding, including
issuances and maturities and redemptions, see
Note 11 – Long-term Debt to the Consolidated
Financial Statements. We use derivative
transactions to manage the duration, interest
rate and currency risks of our borrowings,
considering the characteristics of the assets
they are funding. For more information on our ALM
activities, see Interest Rate Risk Management for
the Banking Book on page 78. Uninsured Deposits
The FDIC insures the Corporation’s U.S. deposits
up to $250,000 per depositor, per insured bank
for each account ownership category, and various
country-specific funds insure non-U.S. deposits
up to specified limits. Deposits that exceed
insurance limits are uninsured. At December 31,
2024, the Corporation’s deposits totaled $1.97
trillion, of which total estimated uninsured U.S.
and non-U.S. deposits were $646.2 billion and
$124.9 billion. At December 31, 2023, the
Corporation’s deposits totaled $1.92 trillion, of
which total estimated uninsured U.S. and non-U.S.
deposits were $606.8 billion and $116.6 billion.
Deposit balances exclude $16.9 billion and $14.8
billion of collateral received on certain
derivative contracts that are netted against the
derivative asset in the Consolidated Balance
Sheet at December 31, 2024 and 2023. Estimated
uninsured deposits presented in this section
reflect amounts disclosed in our regulatory
reports, adjusted to exclude related accrued
interest and intercompany deposit balances. Table
17 presents information about the Corporation’s
total estimated uninsured time deposits. For more
information on our liquidity sources, see Global
Liquidity Sources and Other Unencumbered Assets,
and for more information on deposits, see
Diversified Funding Sources in this section. For
more information on contractual time deposit
maturities, see Note 9 – Deposits to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Contingency Planning We maintain contingency
funding plans that outline our potential
responses to liquidity stress events at various
levels of severity. These policies and plans are
based on stress scenarios and include potential
funding strategies and communication and
notification procedures that we would implement
in the event we experienced stressed liquidity
conditions. We periodically review and test the
contingency funding plans to validate efficacy
and assess readiness. Our U.S. bank subsidiaries
can access contingency funding through the
Federal Reserve Discount Window. Certain non-U.S.
subsidiaries have access to central bank
facilities in the jurisdictions in which they
operate. While we do not rely on these sources in
our liquidity modeling, we maintain the policies,
procedures and governance processes that would
enable us to access these sources if necessary.
Credit Ratings Our borrowing costs and ability to
raise funds are impacted by our credit ratings.
In addition, credit ratings may be important to
customers or counterparties when we compete in
certain markets and when we seek to engage in
certain transactions,
 Bank of America56 
including over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives.
Thus, it is our objective to maintain high-
quality credit ratings, and management maintains
an active dialogue with the major rating
agencies.
Credit ratings and outlooks are opinions
expressed by rating agencies on our
creditworthiness and that of our obligations or
securities, including long-term debt, short-term
borrowings, preferred stock and other securities,
including asset securitizations. Our credit
ratings are subject to ongoing review by the
rating agencies, and they consider a number of
factors, including our own financial strength,
performance, prospects and operations as well as
factors not under our control. The rating
agencies could make adjustments to our ratings at
any time, and they provide no assurances that
they will maintain our ratings at current levels.
Other factors that influence our credit ratings
include changes to the rating agencies’
methodologies for our industry or certain
security types; the rating agencies’ assessment
of the
general operating environment for financial
services companies; our relative positions in the
markets in which we compete; our various risk
exposures and risk management policies and
activities; pending litigation and other
contingencies or potential tail risks; our
reputation; our liquidity position, diversity of
funding sources and funding costs; the current
and expected level and volatility of our
earnings; our capital position and capital
management practices; our corporate governance;
the sovereign credit ratings of the U.S.
government; current or future regulatory and
legislative initiatives; and the agencies’ views
on whether the U.S. government would provide
meaningful support to the Corporation or its
subsidiaries in a crisis.
The ratings and outlooks from Moody's Investors
Service, Standard & Poor’s Global Ratings and
Fitch Ratings for the Corporation and its
subsidiaries did not change during 2024.

NR = not rated
A reduction in certain of our credit ratings or
the ratings of certain asset-backed
securitizations may have a material adverse
effect on our liquidity, potential loss of access
to credit markets, the related cost of funds, our
businesses and on certain revenues, particularly
in those businesses where counterparty
creditworthiness is critical. In addition, under
the terms of certain OTC derivative contracts and
other trading agreements, in the event of
downgrades of our or our rated subsidiaries’
credit ratings, the counterparties to those
agreements may require us to provide additional
collateral, or to terminate these contracts or
agreements, which could cause us to sustain
losses and/or adversely impact our liquidity. If
the short-term credit ratings of our Parent, bank
or broker-dealer subsidiaries were downgraded by
one or more levels, the potential loss of access
to short-term funding sources such as repo
financing and the effect on our incremental cost
of funds could be material.
While certain potential impacts are contractual
and quantifiable, the full scope of the
consequences of a credit rating downgrade to a
financial institution is inherently uncertain, as
it depends upon numerous dynamic, complex and
inter-related factors and assumptions, including
whether any downgrade of a company’s long-term
credit ratings precipitates downgrades to its
short-term credit ratings, and assumptions about
the potential behaviors of various customers,
investors and counterparties. For more
information on potential impacts of credit rating
downgrades, see Liquidity Risk – Liquidity Stress
Analysis on page 55.
For more information on additional collateral and
termination payments that could be required in
connection with certain over-
the-counter derivative contracts and other
trading agreements in the event of a credit
rating downgrade, see Note 3 – Derivatives to the
Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 1A.

 Finance Subsidiary Issuers and Parent Guarantor 
BofA Finance LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company (BofA Finance), is a consolidated finance
subsidiary of the Corporation that has issued and
sold, and is expected to continue to issue and
sell, its senior unsecured debt securities
(Guaranteed Notes) that are fully and
unconditionally guaranteed by the Corporation.
The Corporation guarantees the due and punctual
payment, on demand, of amounts payable on the
Guaranteed Notes if not paid by BofA Finance. In
addition, each of BAC Capital Trust XIII, BAC
Capital Trust XIV and BAC Capital Trust XV,
Delaware statutory trusts (collectively, the
Trusts) is a 100 percent owned finance subsidiary
of the Corporation that has issued and sold trust
preferred securities (the Trust Preferred
Securities) or capital securities (the Capital
Securities and, together with the Guaranteed
Notes and the Trust Preferred Securities, the
Guaranteed Securities), as applicable, that
remained outstanding at December 31, 2024 . The
Corporation guarantees the payment of amounts and
distributions with respect to the Trust Preferred
Securities and Capital Securities
 57Bank of America 
if not paid by the Trusts, to the extent of funds
held by the Trusts. This guarantee, together with
the Corporation’s other obligations with respect
to the Trust Preferred Securities and Capital
Securities, effectively constitutes a full and
unconditional guarantee of the Trusts’ payment
obligations on the Trust Preferred Securities or
Capital Securities, as applicable. No other
subsidiary of the Corporation guarantees the
Guaranteed Securities.
BofA Finance and each of the Trusts are finance
subsidiaries, have no independent assets,
revenues or operations and are dependent upon the
Corporation and/or the Corporation’s other
subsidiaries to meet their respective obligations
under the Guaranteed Securities in the ordinary
course. If holders of the Guaranteed Securities
make claims on their Guaranteed Securities in a
bankruptcy, resolution or similar proceeding, any
recoveries on those claims will be limited to
those available under the applicable guarantee by
the Corporation, as described above.
The Corporation is a holding company and depends
upon its subsidiaries for liquidity. Applicable
laws and regulations and intercompany
arrangements entered into in connection with the
Corporation’s resolution plan could restrict the
availability of funds from subsidiaries to the
Corporation, which could adversely affect the
Corporation’s ability to make payments under its
guarantees. In addition, the obligations of the
Corporation under the guarantees of the
Guaranteed Securities will be structurally
subordinated to all existing and future
liabilities of its subsidiaries, and claimants
should look only to assets of the Corporation for
payments. If the Corporation, as guarantor of the
Guaranteed Notes, transfers all or substantially
all of its assets to one or more direct or
indirect majority-owned subsidiaries, under the
indenture governing the Guaranteed Notes, the
subsidiary or subsidiaries will not be required
to assume the Corporation’s obligations under its
guarantee of the Guaranteed Notes.
For more information on factors that may affect
payments to holders of the Guaranteed Securities,
see Liquidity Risk – NB Holdings Corporation in
this section, Item 1. Business – Insolvency and
the Orderly Liquidation Authority on page 6 and
Item 1A. Risk Factors – Liquidity on page 9.
 Representations and Warranties Obligations 
For information on representations and warranties
obligations in connection with the sale of
mortgage loans, see Note 12 – Commitments and
Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.
 Credit Risk Management 
Credit risk is the risk of loss arising from the
inability or failure of a borrower or
counterparty to meet its obligations. Credit risk
can also arise from operational failures that
result in an erroneous advance, commitment or
investment of funds. We define the credit
exposure to a borrower or counterparty as the
loss potential arising from all product
classifications including loans and leases,
deposit overdrafts, derivatives, assets held-for-
sale and unfunded lending commitments, which
include loan commitments, letters of credit and
financial guarantees. Derivative positions are
recorded at fair value, and assets held-for-sale
are recorded at either fair value or the lower of
cost or
fair value. Certain loans and unfunded
commitments are accounted for under the fair
value option. Credit risk for categories of
assets carried at fair value is not accounted for
as part of the allowance for credit losses but as
part of the fair value adjustments recorded in
earnings. For derivative positions, our credit
risk is measured as the net cost in the event the
counterparties with contracts in which we are in
a gain position fail to perform under the terms
of those contracts. We use the current fair value
to represent credit exposure without giving
consideration to future mark-to-market changes.
The credit risk amounts take into consideration
the effects of legally enforceable master netting
agreements and cash collateral. Our consumer and
commercial credit extension and review procedures
encompass funded and unfunded credit exposures.
For more information on derivatives and credit
extension commitments, see Note 3 – Derivatives
and Note 12 – Commitments and Contingencies to
the Consolidated Financial Statements .
We manage credit risk based on the risk profile
of the borrower or counterparty, repayment
sources, the nature of underlying collateral and
other support given current events, conditions
and expectations. We classify our portfolios as
either consumer or commercial and monitor credit
risk in each as discussed below.
We refine our underwriting and credit risk
management practices as well as credit standards
to meet the changing economic environment. To
mitigate losses and enhance customer support in
our consumer businesses, we have in place
collection programs and loan modification and
customer assistance infrastructures. We utilize a
number of actions to mitigate losses in the
commercial businesses including increasing the
frequency and intensity of portfolio monitoring,
hedging activity and our practice of transferring
management of deteriorating commercial exposures
to independent special asset officers as credits
enter criticized categories.
For information on our credit risk management
activities, see the following: Consumer Portfolio
Credit Risk Management on page 59, Commercial
Portfolio Credit Risk Management on page 63,
Non-U.S. Portfolio on page 69, Allowance for
Credit Losses on page 72 and Note 5 – Outstanding
Loans and Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses
to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For
information on the Corporation’s loan
modification programs, see Note 1 – Summary of
Significant Accounting Principles and Note 5 –
Outstanding Loans and Leases and Allowance for
Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial
Statements. For more information on the
Corporation’s credit risks, see the Credit
section within Item 1A. Risk Factors of this
Annual Report on Form 10-K.
During 2024, our net charge-off ratio increased
primarily driven by credit card loans and the
commercial real estate office portfolio.
Commercial reservable criticized exposure
increased compared to December 31, 2023 driven by
an increase across a broad range of industries.
Nonperforming loans also increased compared to
December 31, 2023 primarily driven by the U.S.
commercial portfolio. Uncertainty remains
regarding broader economic impacts due to higher
costs associated with inflationary pressures
experienced over the past several years, elevated
rates as well as the current geopolitical
environment, and could lead to adverse impacts to
credit quality metrics in future periods.
 Bank of America58 
 Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management 
Credit risk management for the consumer portfolio
begins with initial underwriting and continues
throughout a borrower’s credit cycle. Statistical
techniques in conjunction with experiential
judgment are used in all aspects of portfolio
management including underwriting, product
pricing, risk appetite, setting credit limits,
and establishing operating processes and metrics
to quantify and balance risks and returns.
Statistical models are built using detailed
behavioral information from external sources,
such as credit bureaus, and/or internal
historical experience and are a component of our
consumer credit risk management process. These
models are used in part to assist in making both
new and ongoing credit decisions as well as
portfolio management strategies, including
authorizations and line management, collection
practices and strategies, and determination of
the allowance for loan and lease losses and
allocated capital for credit risk.
 Consumer Credit Portfolio 
During 2024, the U.S. unemployment rate remained
relatively stable, and home prices increased
steadily throughout most of 2024. Net charge-offs
increased $1.1 billion to $4.2 billion in 2024
primarily due to higher credit card loan charge-
offs.
The consumer allowance for loan and lease losses
was $8.6 billion, relatively unchanged from 2023.
For more information, see Allowance for Credit
Losses on page 72.
For more information on our accounting policies
regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status,
charge-offs and loan modifications for the
consumer portfolio, see Note 1 – Summary of
Significant Accounting Principles and Note 5 –
Outstanding Loans and Leases and Allowance for
Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

(1) Residential mortgage loans accruing past due 90 days or more are fully-insured loans. At December
31, 2024 and 2023, residential mortgage included $119 million and $156 million of loans on which
interest had been curtailed by the FHA, and therefore were no longer accruing interest, although
principal was still insured, and $110 million and $96 million of loans on which interest was still
accruing.
(2) Outstandings primarily includes auto and specialty lending loans and leases of $54.9 billion and
$53.9 billion, U.S. securities-based lending loans of $48.7 billion and $46.0 billion at December 31,
2024 and 2023, and non-U.S. consumer loans of $2.8 billion at both December 31, 2024 and 2023.
(3) For more information on the fair value option, see Note 21 – Fair Value Option to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.
(4) Excludes consumer loans accounted for under the fair value option. At December 31, 2024 and 2023,
loans accounted for under the fair value option past due 90 days or more and not accruing interest
were insignificant.

We believe that the presentation of information
adjusted to exclude the impact of the fully-
insured loan portfolio and loans accounted for
under the fair value option is more
representative of the ongoing operations and
credit quality of the business. As a result, in
the following tables and discussions of the
residential mortgage and home equity portfolios,
we exclude loans accounted for under the fair
value option and provide information that
excludes the impact of the fully-insured loan
portfolio in certain credit quality statistics.
 Residential Mortgage 
The residential mortgage portfolio made up the
largest percentage of our consumer loan portfolio
at 49 percent of consumer loans and leases in
2024. Approximately 50 percent of the residential
mortgage portfolio was in Consumer Banking, 47
percent was in GWIM and the remaining portion was
in All Other .
Outstanding balances in the residential mortgage
portfolio decreased $204 million in 2024, as
paydowns and payoffs outpaced new originations.
At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the residential
mortgage portfolio included $9.9 billion and
$11.0 billion of outstanding fully-insured loans,
of which $2.0 billion and $2.2 billion had FHA
insurance, with the remainder protected by Fannie
Mae long-term standby agreements.
Table 21 presents certain residential mortgage
key credit statistics on both a reported basis
and excluding the fully-insured loan portfolio.

(1) Outstandings, accruing past due,
nonperforming loans and percentages of portfolio
exclude loans accounted for under the fair value
option.
(2) Includes loans that are contractually current
that have not yet demonstrated a sustained period
of payment performance following a modification.
Nonperforming outstanding balances in the
residential mortgage portfolio remained
relatively unchanged in 2024. Of the
nonperforming residential mortgage loans at
December 31, 2024, $1.2 billion, or 61 percent,
were current on contractual payments. Excluding
fully-insured loans, loans accruing past due 30
days or more of $1.0 billion also remained
relatively unchanged.
Of the $218.3 billion in total residential
mortgage loans outstanding at December 31, 2024,
$64.0 billion, or 29 percent, of loans were
originated as interest-only. The outstanding
balance of interest-only residential mortgage
loans that had entered the amortization period
was $3.6 billion, or six percent, at December 31,
2024. Residential mortgage loans that have
entered the amortization period generally
experience a higher rate of early stage
delinquencies and nonperforming status compared
to the residential mortgage portfolio as a whole.
At December 31, 2024, $65 million, or two
percent, of outstanding interest-only residential
mortgages that had entered the amortization
period were accruing past due 30 days or more
compared to $1.0 billion, or less than one
percent, for the
entire residential mortgage portfolio. In
addition, at December 31, 2024, $209 million, or
six percent, of outstanding interest-only
residential mortgage loans that had entered the
amortization period were nonperforming, of which
$56 million were contractually current. Loans
that have yet to enter the amortization period in
our interest-only residential mortgage portfolio
are primarily well-collateralized loans to our
wealth management clients and have an interest-
only period of three years to 10 years.
Substantially all of these loans that have yet to
enter the amortization period will not be
required to make a fully-amortizing payment until
2026 or later.
Table 22 presents outstandings, nonperforming
loans and net charge-offs by certain state
concentrations for the residential mortgage
portfolio. In the New York area, the New York-
Northern New Jersey-Long Island Metropolitan
Statistical Area (MSA) made up 15 percent of
outstandings at both December 31, 2024 and 2023.
The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana MSA within
California represented 14 percent of outstandings
at both December 31, 2024 and 2023.

 Home Equity 
At December 31, 2024, the home equity portfolio
made up six percent of the consumer portfolio and
was comprised of home equity lines of credit
(HELOCs), home equity loans and reverse
mortgages. HELOCs generally have an initial draw
period of 10 years, and after the initial draw
period ends, the loans generally convert to 15-
or 20-year amortizing loans. We no longer
originate home equity loans or reverse mortgages.
At December 31, 2024, 85 percent of the home
equity portfolio was in Consumer Banking , 10
percent was in GWIM and the remainder of the
portfolio was in All Other. Outstanding balances
in the home equity portfolio increased $210
million in 2024 primarily due to draws on
existing lines and new
originations outpacing paydowns. Of the total
home equity portfolio at December 31, 2024 and
2023, $9.2 billion and $10.1 billion, or 36
percent and 39 percent, were in first-lien
positions. At December 31, 2024, outstanding
balances in the home equity portfolio that were
in a second-lien or more junior-lien position and
where we also held the first-lien loan totaled
$4.5 billion, or 18 percent, of our total home
equity portfolio.
Unused HELOCs totaled $44.3 billion and $45.1
billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023. The HELOC
utilization rate was 36 percent and 35 percent at
December 31, 2024 and 2023.

Nonperforming outstanding balances in the home
equity portfolio decreased $41 million to $409
million at December 31, 2024, primarily driven by
returns to performing status and paydowns and
payoffs outpacing new additions. Of the
nonperforming home equity loans at December 31,
2024, $246 million, or 60 percent, were current
on contractual payments. In addition, $83
million, or 20 percent, were 180 days or more
past due and had been written down to the
estimated fair value of the collateral, less
costs to sell. Accruing loans that were 30 days
or more past d ue remained relatively unchanged
in 2024 compared to 2023.
Of the $25.7 billion in total home equity
portfolio outstandings at December 31, 2024, as
shown in Table 23, nine percent require interest-
only payments. The outstanding balance of HELOCs
that had reached the end of their draw period and
entered the amortization period was $3.4 billion
at December 31, 2024. The HELOCs that have
entered the amortization period have experienced
a higher percentage of early stage delinquencies
and nonperforming status when compared to the
HELOC portfolio as a whole. At December 31,
2024, $30 million, or one percent, of outstanding
HELOCs that had entered the amortization period
were accruing past due 30 days or more. In
addition, at December 31, 2024, $244 million, or
seven percent, were nonperforming.
For our interest-only HELOC portfolio, we do not
actively track how many of our home equity
customers pay only the minimum amount due on
their home equity loans and lines; however, we
can infer some of this information through a
review of our HELOC portfolio that we service and
is still in its revolving period. During 2024, 15
percent of these customers with an outstanding
balance did not pay any principal on their
HELOCs.
Table 24 presents outstandings, nonperforming
balances and net recoveries by certain state
concentrations for the home equity portfolio. In
the New York area, the New York-Northern New
Jersey-Long Island MSA made up 11 percent of the
outstanding home equity portfolio at both
December 31, 2024 and 2023. The Los Angeles-Long
Beach-Santa Ana MSA within California made up 11
percent and 10 percent of the outstanding home
equity portfolio at December 31, 2024 and 2023.

with the remainder in GWIM . Outstandings in the
credit card portfolio increased $1.4 billion
during 2024 to $103.6 billion, primarily driven
by higher purchase volumes. Net charge-offs
increased $1.2 billion to $3.7 billion in 2024

Nonperforming Consumer Loans, Leases and
Foreclosed Properties Activity
Table 27 presents nonperforming consumer loans,
leases and foreclosed properties activity during
2024 and 2023. During 2024, nonperforming
consumer loans of $2.6 billion remained
relatively unchanged.
At December 31, 2024, $459 million, or 17
percent, of nonperforming loans were 180 days or
more past due and had been written down to their
estimated property value less costs to sell. In
addition, at December 31, 2024, $1.5 billion, or
58 percent, of nonperforming consumer loans were
current and classified as nonperforming loans in
accordance with applicable policies.
Foreclosed properties decreased $14 million in
2024 to $89 million.

 Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management 
Credit risk management for the commercial
portfolio begins with an assessment of the credit
risk profile of the borrower or counterparty
based on an analysis of its financial position.
As part of the overall credit risk assessment,
our commercial credit exposures are assigned a
risk rating and are subject to approval based on
defined credit approval standards. Subsequent to
loan origination, risk ratings are monitored on
an ongoing basis, and if necessary, adjusted to
reflect changes in the financial condition, cash
flow, risk profile or outlook of a borrower or
counterparty. In making credit decisions, we
consider risk rating, collateral, country,
industry and single-name concentration limits
while also balancing these considerations with
the total borrower or counterparty relationship.
We use a variety of tools to continuously monitor
the ability of a borrower or counterparty to
perform under its obligations. We use risk rating
aggregations to measure and evaluate
concentrations within portfolios. In addition,
risk ratings are a factor in determining the
level of allocated capital and the allowance for
credit losses.
As part of our ongoing risk mitigation
initiatives, we attempt to work with clients
experiencing financial difficulty to modify their
loans to terms that better align with their
current ability to pay. For more information on
our accounting policies regarding delinquencies,
nonperforming status and net charge-offs for the
commercial portfolio, see Note 1 – Summary of
Significant Accounting Principles to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.
 Management of Commercial Credit Risk Concentrations 
Commercial credit risk is evaluated and managed
with the goal that concentrations of credit
exposure continue to be aligned with our risk
appetite. We review, measure and manage
concentrations of credit exposure by industry,
product, geography, customer relationship and
loan size. We also review, measure and manage
commercial real estate loans by geographic
location and property type. In addition, within
our non-U.S. portfolio, we evaluate exposures by
region and by country. Tables 32, 34 and 37
summarize our concentrations. We also utilize
syndications of exposure to third parties, loan
sales, hedging and other risk mitigation
techniques to manage the size and risk profile of
the commercial credit portfolio. For more
information on our industry concentrations, see
Table 34 and Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk
Management – Industry Concentrations on page 67.
We account for certain large corporate loans and
loan commitments, including issued but unfunded
letters of credit which are considered utilized
for credit risk management purposes, that exceed
our single-name credit risk concentration
guidelines under the fair value option. Lending
commitments, both funded and unfunded, are
actively managed and monitored, and as
appropriate, credit risk for these lending
relationships may be mitigated through the use of
credit derivatives, with our credit view and
market perspectives determining the size and
timing of the hedging activity. In addition, we
purchase credit protection to cover the funded
portion as well as the unfunded portion of
certain other credit exposures. To lessen the
cost of obtaining our desired credit protection
levels, credit exposure may be added within an
industry, borrower or counterparty group by
selling protection. These credit derivatives do
not meet the requirements for treatment as
accounting hedges. They are carried at fair value
with changes in fair value recorded in other
income.
In addition, we are a member of various
securities and derivative exchanges and
clearinghouses, both in the U.S. and other
countries. As a member, we may be required to pay
a pro-rata share of the losses incurred by some
of these organizations as a result of another
member default and under other loss scenarios.
For more information, see Note 12 – Commitments
and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.
 Commercial Credit Portfolio 
Outstanding commercial loans and leases increased
$37.1 billion during 2024 due to growth in U.S.
and Non-U.S. commercial, primarily in Global
Markets and Global Banking. During 2024,
commercial credit quality deteriorated as
reservable criticized utilized exposure increased
across a broad range of industries, and
nonperforming commercial loans increased
primarily driven by U.S. commercial. Commercial
net charge-offs increased $1.1 billion to $1.8
billion during 2024 primarily due to higher
losses in the commercial real estate office
portfolio and U.S. commercial portfolio.
With the exception of the office property type,
which is further discussed in the Commercial Real
Estate section herein, credit quality of
commercial real estate borrowers has remained
relatively stable since December 31, 2023;
however, we are closely monitoring emerging
trends and borrower performance in a higher
interest rate environment. Recent demand for
office
 63Bank of America 
space continues to be stagnant, and future demand
for office space continues to be uncertain as
companies evaluate space needs with employment
models that utilize a mix of remote and
conventional office use.
The commercial allowance for loan and lease
losses decreased $152 million during 2024 to $4.7
billion. For more information, see Allowance for
Credit Losses on page 72.
Total commercial utilized credit exposure
increased $43.2 billion during 2024 to $739.5
billion primarily driven by higher loans and
leases. The utilization rate for loans and
leases, standby letters of credit (SBLCs) and
financial guarantees, and commercial letters of
credit, in the aggregate, was 55 percent at both
December 31, 2024 and 2023.
Table 28 presents commercial credit exposure by
type for utilized, unfunded and total binding
committed credit exposure. Commercial utilized
credit exposure includes SBLCs and financial
guarantees and commercial letters of credit that
have been issued and for which we are legally
bound to advance funds under prescribed
conditions during a specified time period, and
excludes exposure related to trading account
assets. Although funds have not yet been
advanced, these exposure types are considered
utilized for credit risk management purposes.

At December 31, 2024, 60 percent of the U.S.
commercial loan portfolio, excluding small
business, was managed in Global Banking, 23
percent in Global Markets , 15 percent in GWIM
(loans that provide financing for asset
purchases, business investments and other
liquidity needs for high net worth clients) and
the remainder primarily in Consumer Banking .
U.S. commercial loans increased $28.1 billion, or
eight percent, during 2024 primarily driven by
Global Markets and Global Banking. Reservable
criticized utilized exposure increased $1.4
billion, or 12 percent, driven by a broad range
of industries.

commercial loan portfolio was managed in Global
Banking, 43 percent in Global Markets and the
remainder primarily in GWIM. Non-U.S. commercial
loans increased $12.9 billion, or 10 percent,
during 2024 primarily driven by Global Markets .
Reservable criticized utilized exposure increased
$168 million, or nine percent. For information on
the non-U.S. commercial portfolio, see Non-U.S.
Portfolio on page 69.
 Commercial Real Estate 
Commercial real estate primarily includes
commercial loans secured by non-owner-occupied
real estate and is dependent on the sale or lease
of the real estate as the primary source of
repayment. Outstanding loans decreased $7.1
billion, or 10 percent, during 2024 to $65.7
billion driven by multiple property types,
including office. The commercial real estate
portfolio is primarily managed in Global Banking
and consists of loans made primarily to public
and private developers, and commercial real
estate firms. The portfolio remains diversified
across property types and geographic regions.
California represented the largest state
concentration at 21 percent and 20 percent of
commercial real estate at December 31, 2024 and
2023.
Reservable criticized utilized exposure increased
$1.4 billion, or 16 percent, during 2024
primarily driven by industrial/warehouse and
multi-family rental loans. Office loans
represented the largest property type
concentration at 23 percent of the commercial
real estate portfolio at December 31, 2024, and
approximately one percent of total loans for the
Corporation. This property type is roughly 75
percent Class A and had an origination loan-to-
value of approximately 55 percent.
Reservable criticized exposure for the office
property type was $5.1 billion at December 31,
2024, representing a decrease of $398 million, or
seven percent, from December 31, 2023, with an
aggregate loan-to-value of approximately 85
percent based on property appraisals completed in
the last twelve months. Approximately $5.1
billion of office loans are scheduled to mature
by the end of 2025.
 65Bank of America 
During 2024, net charge-offs increased $619
million to $864 million driven by office loans.
We use a number of proactive risk mitigation
initiatives to reduce adversely rated exposure in
the commercial real estate portfolio, including
transfers of deteriorating exposures for
management by independent special asset officers
and the pursuit of loan
restructurings or asset sales to achieve the best
results for our customers and the Corporation.

 U.S. Small Business Commercial 
The U.S. small business commercial loan portfolio
is comprised of small business card loans and
small business loans primarily managed in
Consumer Banking . Credit card-related products
were 53 percent and 54 percent of the U.S. small
business commercial portfolio at December 31,
2024 and 2023 and represented 99 percent of net
charge-offs for both 2024 and 2023. Accruing past
due 90 days or more increased $13 million in 2024
to $197 million.
Nonperforming Commercial Loans, Leases and
Foreclosed Properties Activity
Table 33 presents the nonperforming commercial
loans, leases and foreclosed properties activity
during 2024 and 2023. Nonperforming loans do not
include loans accounted for under the fair value
option. During 2024, nonperforming commercial
loans and leases increased $555 million to $3.3
billion. At December 31, 2024, nearly 100 percent
of commercial nonperforming loans, leases and
foreclosed properties were secured, and 41
percent were contractually current. Commercial
nonperforming loans were carried at 88 percent of
their unpaid principal balance, as the carrying
value of these loans has been reduced to the
estimated collateral value less costs to sell.

 Industry Concentrations 
Table 34 presents commercial committed and
utilized credit exposure by industry. For
information on net notional credit protection
purchased to hedge funded and unfunded exposures
for which we elected the fair value option, as
well as certain other credit exposures, see
Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management –
Risk Mitigation.
Commercial credit exposure is diversified across
a broad range of industries. Total commercial
committed exposure increased $72.5 billion during
2024 to $1.3 trillion. The increase in commercial
committed exposure was concentrated in Asset
managers and funds, Finance companies and
Individuals and trusts.
Industry limits are used internally to manage
industry concentrations and are based on
committed exposure that is determined on an
industry-by-industry basis. A risk management
framework is in place to set and approve industry
limits as well as to provide ongoing monitoring.
Asset managers and funds, our largest industry
concentration with committed exposure of $193.9
billion, increased $24.6 billion, or 15 percent,
during 2024, which was primarily driven by
investment-grade exposures.
Finance companies, our second largest industry
concentration with committed exposure of $101.8
billion, increased $12.7 billion, or 14 percent,
during 2024. The increase in committed exposure
was primarily driven by increases in Consumer
finance, Thrifts and mortgage finance and
Diversified financials.
Capital goods, our third largest industry
concentration with committed exposure of $98.8
billion, increased $1.7 billion, or two percent,
during 2024. The increase in committed exposure
was driven by increases in Trading companies and
distributors, Machinery, and Construction and
engineering, partially offset by a decrease in
Industrial conglomerates.
Various macroeconomic challenges, including
geopolitical tensions, higher costs associated
with inflationary pressures experienced over the
past several years and elevated interest rates,
have led to uncertainty in the U.S. and global
economies and have adversely impacted, and may
continue to adversely impact, a number of
industries. We continue to monitor all
industries, particularly higher risk industries
that are experiencing or could experience a more
significant impact to their financial condition.

 industry 
(1) Includes U.S. small business commercial exposure.
(2) Includes the notional amount of unfunded legally binding lending commitments, net of amounts
distributed (i.e., syndicated or participated) to other financial institutions. The distributed
amounts were $10.4 billion and $10.3 billion at both December 31, 2024 and 2023.
(3) Industries are viewed from a variety of perspectives to best isolate the perceived risks. For
purposes of this table, the real estate industry is defined based on the primary business activity of
the borrowers or counterparties using operating cash flows and primary source of repayment as key
factors.
Risk Mitigation We purchase credit protection to
cover the funded portion as well as the unfunded
portion of certain credit exposures. To lower the
cost of obtaining our desired credit protection
levels, we may add credit exposure within an
industry, borrower or counterparty group by
selling protection. At December 31, 2024 and
2023, net notional credit default protection
purchased in our credit derivatives portfolio to
hedge our funded and unfunded exposures for which
we elected the fair value option, as well as
certain other credit exposures, was $10.4 billion
and $10.9 billion. We recorded net losses of $87
million in 2024 compared to net losses $185
million in 2023. The gains and losses on these
instruments were largely offset by gains and
losses on the related exposures. The Value-at-
Risk (VaR) results for these exposures are
included in the fair value option portfolio
information in Table 41. For more information,
see Trading Risk Management on page 75.

NR is comprised of index positions held and any names that have not been rated. In addition to our
net notional credit default protection purchased to cover the funded and unfunded portion of certain
credit exposures, credit derivatives are used for market-making activities for clients and
establishing positions intended to profit from directional or relative value changes. We execute the
majority of our credit derivative trades in the OTC market with large, multinational financial
institutions, including broker-dealers and, to a lesser degree, with a variety of other investors.
Because these transactions are executed in the OTC market, we are subject to settlement risk. We are
also subject to credit risk in the event that these counterparties fail to perform under the terms of
these contracts. In order to properly reflect counterparty credit risk, we record counterparty credit
risk valuation adjustments on certain derivative assets, including our purchased credit default
protection. In most cases, credit derivative transactions are executed on a daily margin basis.
Therefore, events such as a credit downgrade, depending on the ultimate rating level, or a breach of
credit covenants would typically require an increase in the amount of collateral required by the
counterparty, where applicable, and/or allow us to take additional protective measures such as early
termination of all
trades. For more information on credit derivatives and counterparty credit risk valuation
adjustments, see Note 3 – Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Non-U.S. Portfolio
Our non-U.S. credit and trading portfolios are subject to country risk. We define country risk as the
risk of loss from unfavorable economic and political conditions, currency fluctuations, social
instability and changes in government policies. A risk management framework is in place to measure,
monitor and manage non-U.S. risk and exposures. In addition to the direct risk of doing business in a
country, we also are exposed to indirect country risks (e.g., related to the collateral received on
secured financing transactions or related to client clearing activities). These indirect exposures
are managed in the normal course of business through credit, market and operational risk governance
rather than through country risk governance. Table 37 presents our 20 largest non-U.S. country
exposures at December 31, 2024. These exposures accounted for 89 percent of our total non-U.S.
exposure at both December 31, 2024 and 2023. Net country exposure for these 20 countries increased
$21.5 billion in 2024 primarily driven by increases in the United Kingdom and Canada. Non-U.S.
exposure is presented on an internal risk management basis and includes sovereign and non-sovereign
credit exposure, securities and other investments issued by or domiciled in countries other than the
U.S. Funded loans and loan equivalents include loans, leases, and other extensions of credit and
funds, including letters of credit and due from placements. Unfunded commitments are the undrawn
portion of legally binding commitments related to loans and loan equivalents. Net counterparty
exposure includes the fair value of derivatives, including the counterparty risk associated with
credit default swaps (CDS), and secured financing transactions. Securities and other investments are
carried at fair value and long securities exposures are netted against short exposures with the same
underlying issuer to, but not below, zero. Net country exposure represents country exposure less
hedges and credit default protection purchased, net of credit default protection sold.

(1) Ratios are calculated as allowance for loan
and lease losses as a percentage of loans and
leases outstanding excluding loans accounted for
under the fair value option.
(2) Includes allowance for loan and lease losses
for U.S. small business commercial loans of $1.2
billion and $1.0 billion at December 31, 2024 and
2023.
n/m = not meaningful
Net charge-offs for 2024 were $6.0 billion
compared to $3.8 billion in 2023 primarily due to
credit card loans and the commercial real estate
office portfolio. The provision for credit losses
increased $1.4 billion to $5.8 billion during
2024 compared to 2023. The provision for credit
losses in 2024 was primarily driven by credit
card as well as small business loan growth, and
asset quality deterioration in the commercial
real estate office and credit card portfolios.
The provision for credit losses for the consumer
portfolio, including unfunded lending
commitments, decreased $267 million to $4.3
billion during 2024 compared to 2023. The
provision for credit losses for the
commercial portfolio, including unfunded lending
commitments, increased $1.7 billion to $1.6
billion during 2024 compared to 2023.
Table 40 presents a rollforward of the allowance
for credit losses, including certain loan and
allowance ratios for 2024 and 2023. For more
information on the Corporation’s credit loss
accounting policies and activity related to the
allowance for credit losses, see Note 1 – Summary

 Market Risk Management 
Market risk is the risk that changes in market
conditions may adversely impact the value of
assets or liabilities, or otherwise negatively
impact earnings. This risk is inherent in the
financial instruments associated with our
operations, primarily within our Global Markets
segment. We are also exposed to these risks in
other areas of the Corporation (e.g., our ALM
activities). In the event of market stress, these
risks could have a material impact on our
results. For more information, see Interest Rate
Risk Management for the Banking Book on page 78.
Our traditional banking loan and deposit products
are non-trading positions and are generally
reported at amortized cost for assets or the
amount owed for liabilities (historical cost).
However, these positions are still subject to
changes in economic value based on varying market
conditions, with one of the primary risks being
changes in the levels of interest rates. The risk
of adverse changes in the economic value of our
non-trading positions arising from changes in
interest rates is managed through our ALM
activities. We have elected to account for
certain assets and liabilities under the fair
value option.
Our trading positions are reported at fair value
with changes reflected in income. Trading
positions are subject to various changes in
market-based risk factors. The majority of this
risk is generated by our activities in the
interest rate, foreign exchange, credit, equity
and commodities markets. In addition, the values
of assets and liabilities could change due to
market liquidity, correlations across markets and
expectations of market volatility. We seek to
manage these risk exposures by using a variety of
techniques that encompass a broad range of
financial instruments. The key risk management
techniques are discussed in more detail in the
Trading Risk Management section.
GRM is responsible for providing senior
management with a clear and comprehensive
understanding of the trading risks to which we
are exposed. These responsibilities include
ownership of market risk policy, developing and
maintaining quantitative risk models, calculating
aggregated risk measures, establishing and
monitoring position limits consistent with risk
appetite, conducting daily reviews and analysis
of trading inventory, approving material risk
exposures and fulfilling regulatory requirements.
Market risks that impact businesses outside of
Global Markets are monitored and governed by
their respective governance functions.
Model risk is the potential for adverse
consequences from decisions based on incorrect or
misused model outputs and reports. Given that
models are used across the Corporation, model
risk impacts all risk types including credit,
market and operational risks. The Enterprise
Model Risk Policy defines model risk standards,
consistent with our Risk Framework and risk
appetite, prevailing regulatory guidance and
industry best practice. All models, including
risk management, valuation and regulatory capital
models, must meet certain validation criteria,
including effective challenge of the conceptual
soundness of the model, independent model testing
and ongoing monitoring through outcomes analysis
and benchmarking. The Enterprise Model Risk
Committee, a subcommittee of the MRC, oversees
that model standards are consistent with model
risk requirements and monitors the effective
challenge in the model validation process across
the Corporation.
 Interest Rate Risk 
Interest rate risk represents exposures to
instruments whose values vary with the level or
volatility of interest rates. These instruments
include, but are not limited to, loans, debt
securities, certain trading-related assets and
liabilities, deposits, borrowings and
derivatives. Hedging instruments used to mitigate
these risks include derivatives such as options,
futures, forwards and swaps.
 Foreign Exchange Risk 
Foreign exchange risk represents exposures to
changes in the values of current holdings and
future cash flows denominated in currencies other
than the U.S. dollar. The types of instruments
exposed to this risk include investments in
non-U.S. subsidiaries, foreign currency-
denominated loans and securities, future cash
flows in foreign currencies arising from foreign
exchange transactions, foreign currency-
denominated debt and various foreign exchange
derivatives whose values fluctuate with changes
in the level or volatility of currency exchange
rates or non-U.S. interest rates. Hedging
instruments used to mitigate this risk include
foreign exchange options, currency swaps,
futures, forwards, and foreign currency-
denominated debt and deposits.
 Mortgage Risk 
Mortgage risk represents exposures to changes in
the values of mortgage-related instruments. The
values of these instruments are sensitive to
prepayment rates, mortgage rates, agency debt
ratings, default, market liquidity, government
participation and interest rate volatility. Our
exposure to these instruments takes several
forms. For example, we trade and engage in
market-making activities in a variety of mortgage
securities including whole loans, pass-through
certificates, commercial mortgages and
collateralized mortgage obligations including
collateralized debt obligations using mortgages
as underlying collateral. In addition, we
originate a variety of MBS, which involves the
accumulation of mortgage-related loans in
anticipation of eventual securitization, and we
may hold positions in mortgage securities and
residential mortgage loans as part of the ALM
portfolio. We also record MSRs as part of our
mortgage origination activities. Hedging
instruments used to mitigate this risk include
derivatives such as options, swaps, futures and
forwards as well as securities including MBS and
U.S. Treasury securities. For more information,
see Mortgage Banking Risk Management on page 80.
 Equity Market Risk 
Equity market risk represents exposures to
securities that represent an ownership interest
in a corporation in the form of domestic and
foreign common stock or other equity-linked
instruments. Instruments that would lead to this
exposure include, but are not limited to, the
following: common stock, exchange-traded funds,
American Depositary Receipts, convertible bonds,
listed equity options (puts and calls), OTC
equity options, equity total return swaps, equity
index futures and other equity derivative
products. Hedging instruments used to mitigate
this risk include options, futures, swaps,
convertible bonds and cash positions.
 Commodity Risk 
Commodity risk represents exposures to
instruments traded in the petroleum, natural gas,
power and metals markets. These instruments
consist primarily of futures, forwards, swaps and
options. Hedging instruments used to mitigate
this risk include
 Bank of America74 
options, futures and swaps in the same or similar
commodity product, as well as cash positions.
 Issuer Credit Risk 
Issuer credit risk represents exposures to
changes in the creditworthiness of individual
issuers or groups of issuers. Our portfolio is
exposed to issuer credit risk where the value of
an asset may be adversely impacted by changes in
the levels of credit spreads, by credit migration
or by defaults. Hedging instruments used to
mitigate this risk include bonds, CDS and other
credit fixed-income instruments.
 Market Liquidity Risk 
Market liquidity risk represents the risk that
the level of expected market activity changes
dramatically and, in certain cases, may even
cease. This exposes us to the risk that we will
not be able to transact business and execute
trades in an orderly manner which may impact our
results. This impact could be further exacerbated
if expected hedging or pricing correlations are
compromised by disproportionate demand or lack of
demand for certain instruments. We utilize
various risk mitigating techniques as discussed
in more detail in Trading Risk Management.
 Trading Risk Management 
To evaluate risks in our trading activities, we
focus on the actual and potential volatility of
revenues generated by individual positions as
well as portfolios of positions. Various
techniques and procedures are utilized to enable
the most complete understanding of these risks.
Quantitative measures of market risk are
evaluated on a daily basis from a single position
to the portfolio of the Corporation. These
measures include sensitivities of positions to
various market risk factors, such as the
potential impact on revenue from a one basis
point change in interest rates, and statistical
measures utilizing both actual and hypothetical
market moves, such as VaR and stress testing.
Periods of extreme market stress influence the
reliability of these techniques to varying
degrees. Qualitative evaluations of market risk
utilize the suite of quantitative risk measures
while understanding each of their respective
limitations. Additionally, risk managers
independently evaluate the risk of the portfolios
under the current market environment and
potential future environments.
VaR is a common statistic used to measure market
risk as it allows the aggregation of market risk
factors, including the effects of portfolio
diversification. A VaR model simulates the value
of a portfolio under a range of scenarios in
order to generate a distribution of potential
gains and losses. VaR represents the loss a
portfolio is not expected to exceed more than a
certain number of times per period, based on a
specified holding period, confidence level and
window of historical data. We use one VaR model
consistently across the trading portfolios and it
uses a historical simulation approach based on a
three-year window of historical data. Our primary
VaR statistic is equivalent to a 99 percent
confidence level, which means that for a VaR with
a one-day holding period, there should not be
losses in excess of VaR, on average, 99 out of
100 trading days.
Within any VaR model, there are significant and
numerous assumptions that will differ from
company to company. The accuracy of a VaR model
depends on the availability and quality of
historical data for each of the risk factors in
the portfolio. A VaR model may require additional
modeling assumptions for new products that do not
have the necessary historical market data or for
less liquid positions for which accurate daily
prices
are not consistently available. For positions
with insufficient historical data for the VaR
calculation, the process for establishing an
appropriate proxy is based on fundamental and
statistical analysis of the new product or less
liquid position. This analysis identifies
reasonable alternatives that replicate both the
expected volatility and correlation to other
market risk factors that the missing data would
be expected to experience.
VaR may not be indicative of realized revenue
volatility as changes in market conditions or in
the composition of the portfolio can have a
material impact on the results. In particular,
the historical data used for the VaR calculation
might indicate higher or lower levels of
portfolio diversification than will be
experienced. In order for the VaR model to
reflect current market conditions, we update the
historical data underlying our VaR model on a
weekly basis, or more frequently during periods
of market stress, and regularly review the
assumptions underlying the model. A minor portion
of risks related to our trading positions is not
included in VaR. These risks are reviewed as part
of our ICAAP. For more information regarding
ICAAP, see Capital Management on page 48.
GRM continually reviews, evaluates and enhances
our VaR model so that it reflects the material
risks in our trading portfolio. Changes to the
VaR model are reviewed and approved prior to
implementation and any material changes are
reported to management through the appropriate
management committees.
Trading limits on quantitative risk measures,
including VaR, are independently set by Global
Markets Risk Management and reviewed on a regular
basis so that trading limits remain relevant and
within our overall risk appetite for market
risks. Trading limits are reviewed in the context
of market liquidity, volatility and strategic
business priorities. Trading limits are set at
both a granular level to allow for extensive
coverage of risks as well as at aggregated
portfolios to account for correlations among risk
factors. All trading limits are approved at least
annually. Approved trading limits are stored and
tracked in a centralized limits management
system. Trading limit excesses are communicated
to management for review. Certain quantitative
market risk measures and corresponding limits
have been identified as critical in the
Corporation’s Risk Appetite Statement. These risk
appetite limits are reported on a daily basis and
are approved at least annually by the ERC and the
Board.
In periods of market stress, Global Markets
senior leadership communicates daily to discuss
losses, key risk positions and any limit
excesses. As a result of this process, the
businesses may selectively reduce risk.
Table 41 presents the total market-based
portfolio VaR, which is the combination of the
total covered positions (and less liquid trading
positions) portfolio and the fair value option
portfolio. Covered positions are defined by
regulatory standards as trading assets and
liabilities, both on- and off-balance sheet, that
meet a defined set of specifications. These
specifications identify the most liquid trading
positions which are intended to be held for a
short-term horizon and where we are able to hedge
the material risk elements in a two-way market.
Positions in less liquid markets, or where there
are restrictions on the ability to trade the
positions, typically do not qualify as covered
positions. Foreign exchange and commodity
positions are always considered covered
positions, except for structural foreign currency
positions that are excluded with prior regulatory
approval.
In addition, Table 41 presents our fair value
option portfolio, which includes substantially
all of the funded and unfunded exposures for
which we elect the fair value option, and their
 75Bank of America 
corresponding hedges. Additionally, market risk
VaR for trading activities, as presented in Table
41, differs from VaR used for regulatory capital
calculations due to the holding period used. The
holding period for VaR used for regulatory
capital calculations is 10 days, while for the
market risk VaR presented below, it is one day.
Both measures utilize the same process and
methodology.
The total market-based portfolio VaR results in
Table 41 include market risk to which we are
exposed from all business segments, excluding
credit valuation adjustment (CVA), DVA and
related hedges. The majority of this portfolio is
within the Global Markets segment.
Table 41 presents year-end, average, high and low
daily trading VaR for 2024 and 2023 using a 99
percent confidence level. The amounts disclosed
in Table 41 and Table 42 align to the view of
covered positions used in the Basel 3 capital
calculations. Foreign exchange and commodity
positions are always considered covered
positions, regardless of trading or banking
treatment for the trade, except for structural
foreign currency positions that are excluded with
prior regulatory approval.
The annual average of total covered positions and
less liquid trading positions portfolio VaR
marginally decreased for 2024 compared to 2023,
with modest changes across asset classes.

Additional VaR statistics produced within our single VaR model are provided in Table 42 at the same
level of detail as in Table 41. Evaluating VaR with additional statistics allows for an increased
understanding of the risks in the portfolio, as the historical market data used in the VaR
calculation does not necessarily follow a predefined statistical distribution. Table 42 presents

 Backtesting 
The accuracy of the VaR methodology is evaluated
by backtesting, which compares the daily VaR
results, utilizing a one-day holding period,
against a comparable subset of trading revenue. A
backtesting excess occurs when a trading loss
exceeds the VaR for the corresponding day. These
excesses are evaluated to understand the
positions and market moves that produced the
trading loss with a goal to help confirm that the
VaR methodology accurately represents those
losses. We expect the frequency of trading losses
in excess of VaR to be in line with the
confidence level of the VaR statistic being
tested. For example, with a 99 percent confidence
level, we expect one trading loss in excess of
VaR every 100 days or between two to three
trading losses in excess of VaR over the course
of a year. The number of backtesting excesses
observed can differ from the statistically
expected number of excesses if the current level
of market volatility is materially different than
the level of market volatility that existed
during the three years of historical data used in
the VaR calculation.
The trading revenue used for backtesting is
defined by regulatory agencies in order to most
closely align with the VaR component of the
regulatory capital calculation. This revenue
differs from total trading-related revenue in
that it excludes revenue from trading activities
that either do not generate market risk or for
which the market risk cannot be included in VaR.
Some examples of the types of revenue excluded
for backtesting are fees, commissions, reserves,
net interest income and intra-day trading
revenues.
We conduct daily backtesting on the VaR results
used for regulatory capital calculations as well
as at the level of key legal entities. These
results are reported to senior management, who
regularly review and evaluate the results of
these tests.
During 2024, there was one day where this subset
of trading revenue had losses that exceeded our
total covered portfolio VaR, utilizing a one-day
holding period.
 Total Trading-related Revenue 
Total trading-related revenue, excluding
brokerage fees, and CVA, DVA and funding
valuation adjustment gains (losses), represents
the total amount earned from trading positions,
including market-based net interest income, which
are taken in a diverse range of financial
instruments and markets. For more information on
fair value, see Note 20 – Fair Value Measurements
to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Trading-related revenue can be volatile and is
largely driven by general market conditions and
customer demand. Also, trading-related revenue is
dependent on the volume and type of transactions,
the level of risk assumed, and the volatility of
price and rate movements at any given time within
the ever-changing market environment. Significant
daily revenue by business is monitored and the
primary drivers of these are reviewed.
The following histogram is a graphic depiction of
trading volatility and illustrates the daily
level of trading-related revenue for 2024 and
2023. During 2024, positive trading-related
revenue was recorded for more than 99 percent of
the trading days, of which 94 percent were daily
trading gains of over $25 million, and the
largest loss was $12 million. This compares to
2023 where positive trading-related revenue was
recorded for 100 percent of the trading days, of
which 93 percent were daily trading gains of over
$25 million.
 77Bank of America 
Trading Portfolio Stress Testing Because the very
nature of a VaR model suggests results can exceed
our estimates and it is dependent on a limited
historical window, we also stress test our
portfolio using scenario analysis. This analysis
estimates the change in the value of our trading
portfolio that may result from abnormal market
movements. A set of scenarios, categorized as
either historical or hypothetical, are computed
daily for the overall trading portfolio and
individual businesses. These scenarios include
shocks to underlying market risk factors that may
be well beyond the shocks found in the historical
data used to calculate VaR. Historical scenarios
simulate the impact of the market moves that
occurred during a period of extended historical
market stress. Generally, a multi-week period
representing the most severe point during a
crisis is selected for each historical scenario.
Hypothetical scenarios provide estimated
portfolio impacts from potential future market
stress events. Scenarios are reviewed and updated
in response to changing positions and new
economic or political information. In addition,
new or ad hoc scenarios are developed to address
specific potential market events or particular
vulnerabilities in the portfolio. The stress
tests are reviewed on a regular basis and the
results are presented to senior management.
Stress testing for the trading portfolio is
integrated with enterprise-wide stress testing
and incorporated into the limits framework. The
macroeconomic scenarios used for enterprise-wide
stress testing purposes differ from the typical
trading portfolio scenarios in that they have a
longer time horizon and the results are
forecasted over multiple periods for use in
consolidated capital and liquidity planning. For
more information, see Managing Risk on page 45.
Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking
Book The following discussion presents net
interest income for banking book activities.
Interest rate risk represents the most
significant market risk exposure to our banking
book balance sheet. Interest rate risk is
measured as the potential change in net interest
income caused by movements in market interest
rates. Client-facing activities, primarily
lending and deposit-taking, create interest rate
sensitive positions on our balance sheet.
We prepare forward-looking forecasts of net
interest income. The baseline forecast takes into
consideration expected future business growth,
ALM positioning and the future direction of
interest rate movements as implied by market-
based forward curves. We then measure and
evaluate the impact that alternative interest
rate scenarios have on the baseline forecast in
order to assess interest rate sensitivity under
varied conditions. The net interest income
forecast is frequently updated for changing
assumptions and differing outlooks based on
economic trends, market conditions and business
strategies. Thus, we continually monitor our
banking book balance sheet position in order to
maintain an acceptable level of exposure to
interest rate changes. The interest rate
scenarios that we analyze incorporate balance
sheet assumptions such as loan and deposit growth
and pricing, changes in funding mix, product
repricing, maturity characteristics and
investment securities premium amortization. Our
overall goal is to manage interest rate risk so
that movements in interest rates do not
significantly adversely affect earnings and
capital. Table 43 presents the spot and 12-month
forward rates used in developing the forward
curve used in our baseline forecasts at December
31, 2024 and 2023.

months from December 31, 2024 and 2023 resulting
from instantaneous parallel and non-parallel
shocks to the market-based forward curve.
Periodically, we evaluate the scenarios presented
so that they are meaningful in the context of the
current rate environment.

(1) Dynamic Deposit sensitivity reflects behavioral customer deposit balance changes that could occur
under various scenarios while Static Deposits assumes no deposit balance change.
n/a=not applicable
We continue to be asset sensitive to a parallel
upward move in interest rates with the majority
of that impact coming from the short end of the
yield curve. Additionally, higher interest rates
negatively impact the fair value of our debt
securities classified as available for sale and
adversely affect accumulated OCI and thus capital
levels under the Basel 3 capital rules. Under
instantaneous upward parallel shifts, the near-
term adverse impact to Basel 3 capital would be
reduced over time by offsetting positive impacts
to net interest income generated from banking
book activities. For more information on Basel 3,
see Capital Management – Regulatory Capital on
page 49.
As part of our ALM activities, we use securities,
certain residential mortgages, and interest rate
and foreign exchange derivatives in managing
interest rate sensitivity. The sensitivity
analysis in Table 44 assumes that we take no
action in response to these rate shocks and does
not assume any change in other macroeconomic
variables normally correlated with changes in
interest rates. Beginning in the second quarter
of 2024, the sensitivity analysis incorporates
potential movements in customer behavior that
could result in changes in both total customer
deposit balances and deposit balance mix, (e.g.,
interest bearing versus noninterest bearing),
under the various interest rate scenarios. In
higher rate scenarios, the analysis assumes that
a portion of low-cost or noninterest-bearing
deposits are replaced with higher yielding
deposits or market-based funding. Conversely, in
lower rate scenarios, the analysis assumes that a
portion of higher yielding deposits or market-
based funding are replaced with low-cost or
noninterest-bearing deposits.
For larger interest rate scenarios, the interest
rate sensitivity may behave in a non-linear
manner as there are numerous estimates and
assumptions, which require a high degree of
judgment and are often interrelated, that could
impact the outcome. Pertaining to the mortgage-
backed securities and residential mortgage
portfolio, if long-end interest rates were to
significantly decrease over the next twelve
months, for example over 200 bps, there would
generally be an increase in customer prepayment
behaviors with an incremental reduction to net
interest income, noting that the extent of
changes in customer prepayment activity can be
impacted by multiple factors and is not
necessarily limited to long-end interest rates.
Conversely, if long-end interest rates were to
significantly increase over the next twelve
months, for example, over 200 bps, customer
prepayments would likely modestly decrease and
result in an incremental increase to net interest
income. In addition, deposit pricing is rate
sensitive in nature. This sensitivity is assumed
to have non-linear impacts to larger short-end
rate movements. In
decreasing interest rate scenarios, and
particularly where interest rates have decreased
to small amounts, the ability to further reduce
rates paid is reduced as customer rates near
zero. In higher short-end rate scenarios, deposit
pricing will likely increase at a faster rate,
leading to incremental interest expense and
reducing asset sensitivity. While the impact
related to the above assumptions used in the
asset sensitivity analysis can provide
directional analysis on how net interest income
will be impacted in changing environments, the
ultimate impact is dependent upon the
interrelationship of the assumptions and factors,
which vary in different macroeconomic scenarios.
 Economic Value of Equity 
In addition to interest rate sensitivity
described above, the Corporation’s management of
its interest rate exposures in the banking book
also considers a long-term view of interest rate
sensitivity through the measurement of Economic
Value of Equity (EVE). EVE captures changes in
the net present value of banking book assets and
liabilities under various interest rate scenarios
and its impact to Tier 1 capital. Similar to net
interest income, the Corporation establishes
limits for EVE. EVE is largely driven by the
Corporation’s longer duration fixed-rate
products, such as investment securities,
residential mortgages and deposits. For assets or
liabilities that have no stated maturity, such as
deposits, the Corporation estimates the duration
for measurement purposes.
Interest Rate and Foreign Exchange Derivative
Contracts
We use interest rate and foreign exchange
derivative contracts in our ALM activities to
manage our interest rate and foreign exchange
risks. Specifically, we use those derivatives to
manage both the variability in cash flows and
changes in fair value of various assets and
liabilities arising from those risks. Our
interest rate derivative contracts are generally
non-leveraged swaps tied to various benchmark
interest rates and foreign exchange basis swaps,
options, futures and forwards, and our foreign
exchange contracts include cross-currency
interest rate swaps, foreign currency futures
contracts, foreign currency forward contracts and
options.
The derivatives used in our ALM activities can be
split into two broad categories: designated
accounting hedges and other risk management
derivatives. Designated accounting hedges are
primarily used to manage our exposure to interest
rates as described in the Interest Rate Risk
Management for the Banking Book section and are
included in the sensitivities presented in Table
44. The Corporation also uses foreign currency
derivatives
 79Bank of America 
in accounting hedges to manage substantially all
of the foreign exchange risk of our foreign
operations. By hedging the foreign exchange risk
of our foreign operations, the Corporation's
market risk exposure in this area is not
significant.
Risk management derivatives are predominantly
used to hedge foreign exchange risks related to
various foreign currency-denominated assets and
liabilities and eliminate substantially all
foreign currency exposures in the cash flows of
the Corporation’s non-trading foreign currency-
denominated financial instruments. These foreign
exchange derivatives are sensitive to other
market risk exposures such as cross-currency
basis spreads and interest rate risk. However, as
these features are not a significant component of
these foreign exchange derivatives, the market
risk related to this exposure is not significant.
For more information on the accounting for
derivatives, see Note 3 – Derivatives to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.
 Mortgage Banking Risk Management 
We originate, fund and service mortgage loans,
which subject us to credit, liquidity and
interest rate risks, among others. We determine
whether loans will be held for investment or held
for sale at the time of commitment and manage
credit and liquidity risks by selling or
securitizing a portion of the loans we originate.
Interest rate risk and market risk can be
substantial in the mortgage business. Changes in
interest rates and other market factors impact
the volume of mortgage originations. Changes in
interest rates also impact the value of interest
rate lock commitments (IRLCs) and the related
residential first mortgage LHFS between the date
of the IRLC and the date the loans are sold to
the secondary market. An increase in mortgage
interest rates typically leads to a decrease in
the value of these instruments. Conversely, when
there is an increase in interest rates, the value
of the MSRs will increase driven by lower
prepayment expectations. Because the interest
rate risks of these hedged items offset, we
combine them into one overall hedged item with
one combined economic hedge portfolio consisting
of derivative contracts and securities.
 Compliance and Operational Risk Management 
Compliance risk is the risk of legal or
regulatory sanctions, material financial loss or
damage to the reputation of the Corporation
arising from the failure of the Corporation to
comply with the requirements of applicable LRRs
and our internal policies and procedures
(collectively, applicable LRRs). We are subject
to comprehensive and evolving regulation under
federal and state laws, rules and regulations in
the U.S. and the laws of the various
jurisdictions in which we operate, including
those related to financial crimes and anti-money
laundering, market conduct, trading activities,
fair lending, privacy, data protection,
development and use of AI, and unfair, deceptive
or abusive acts or practices.
Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting
from inadequate or failed internal processes or
systems, people or external events, and includes
legal risk. Operational risk may occur anywhere
in the Corporation, including third-party
business processes, and is not limited to
operations functions. The Corporation faces a
number of key operational risks including third-
party risk, model risk, conduct risk, technology
risk, information security risk and data risk.
The pace of technological change, including in
the field of AI, may heighten risks in those
areas. Operational risk can result in financial
losses and reputational impacts and is a
component in
the calculation of total RWA used in the Basel 3
capital calculation. For more information on
Basel 3 calculations, see Capital Management on
page 48.
FLUs and control functions are first and foremost
responsible for managing all aspects of their
businesses, including their compliance and
operational risk. FLUs and control functions are
required to understand their business processes
and related risks and controls, including third-
party dependencies and the related regulatory
requirements, and monitor and report on the
effectiveness of the control environment. In
order to actively monitor and assess the
performance of their processes and controls, they
must conduct comprehensive quality assurance
activities and identify issues and risks to
remediate control gaps and weaknesses. FLUs and
control functions must also adhere to compliance
and operational risk appetite limits to meet
strategic, capital and financial planning
objectives. Finally, FLUs and control functions
are responsible for the proactive identification,
management and escalation of compliance and
operational risks across the Corporation.
Collectively, these efforts are important to
strengthen their compliance and operational
resiliency, which is the ability to deliver
critical operations through disruption. To
address AI-related risks, we have implemented
internal processes and governance frameworks.
These measures help with regulatory compliance
and responsible use of AI across our operations.
Global Compliance and Operational Risk teams
independently assess compliance and operational
risk, monitor business activities and processes
and evaluate FLUs and control functions for
adherence to applicable LRRs, including
identifying issues and risks, and reporting on
the state of the control environment. Corporate
Audit provides an independent assessment and
validation through testing of key compliance and
operational risk processes and controls across
the Corporation.
The Corporation's Global Compliance – Enterprise
Policy and Operational Risk Management –
Enterprise Policy set the requirements for
reporting compliance and operational risk
information to executive management as well as
the Board or appropriate Board-level committees
and reflect Global Compliance and Operational
Risk’s responsibilities for conducting
independent oversight of the Corporation’s
compliance and operational risk management
activities. The Board provides oversight of
compliance risk through its Audit Committee and
the ERC, and operational risk through its ERC.
 Cybersecurity 
 Risk Management and Strategy 
Cybersecurity is a key operational risk facing
the Corporation. We, our employees, customers,
regulators and third parties are ongoing targets
of an increasing number of cybersecurity threats
and cyberattacks and, accordingly, the
Corporation devotes considerable resources to the
establishment and maintenance of processes for
assessing, identifying and managing cybersecurity
risk through its global workforce and 24/7 cyber
operations centers around the world. The
Corporation takes a cross-functional approach to
addressing cybersecurity risk, with our Global
Technology, Global Risk Management, Legal and
Corporate Audit functions playing key roles. In
addition, the Corporation’s processes related to
cybersecurity risk are an element of and
integrated with the Corporation’s comprehensive
risk program, including our risk framework.For
more information on the Corporation’s
Cybersecurity risk, see Item 1A. Risk Factors –
Business Operations beginning on page 14. For
more
 Bank of America80 
information on our approach to risk management,
including our risk management governance
framework, see Managing Risk on page 45. As part
of the Corporation’s overall risk management
program, the Corporation’s Global Information
Security (GIS) Program is supported by three
lines of defense. As the first line of defense,
the GIS team is responsible for the day-to-day
management of the GIS Program, which includes
defining policies and procedures designed to
safeguard the Corporation’s information systems
and the information those systems collect,
process, maintain, use, share, disseminate and
dispose of. As the second line of defense, Global
Compliance and Operational Risk independently
assesses, monitors and tests cybersecurity risk
across the Corporation, as well as the
effectiveness of the GIS Program. As the third
line of defense, Corporate Audit conducts
additional independent review and validation of
the first-line and second-line processes and
functions. The Corporation seeks to mitigate
cybersecurity risk and associated legal,
financial, reputational, operational and/or
regulatory risks by employing a multi-faceted GIS
Program, through various policies and procedures,
that are focused on governing, preparing for,
identifying, preventing, detecting, mitigating,
responding to and recovering from cybersecurity
threats and incidents suffered by the Corporation
and its third-party service providers, as well as
effectively operating the Corporation’s
processes. Our business continuity policies and
procedures are designed to maintain the
availability of business functions and enable
impacted units within the Corporation and its
third-party service providers to achieve
strategic objectives in the event of a
cybersecurity incident. In accordance with the
Corporation’s cyber incident response framework,
GIS, including its incident response team,
tracks, documents, responds to and analyzes
cybersecurity threats and cybersecurity
incidents, including those experienced by the
Corporation’s third-party service providers that
may impact the Corporation. Additionally, the
Corporation has a process for assembling multi-
stakeholder executive response teams to monitor
and coordinate cross-functional responses to
certain cybersecurity incidents. As part of the
GIS Program, the Corporation leverages both
internal and external assessments and industry
partnerships. The Corporation engages third-party
assessors, consultants, auditors and other third-
party professionals to evaluate and test its
cybersecurity program and provide guidance on
operating and improving the GIS Program,
including the design and operational
effectiveness of the security and resiliency of
our information systems. The Corporation focuses
on and has processes to oversee cybersecurity
risk associated with its third-party service
providers. As part of its cybersecurity risk
management processes, the Corporation maintains
an enterprise-wide program that defines standards
for the planning, sourcing, management, and
oversight of third-party relationships and third-
party access to its information system,
facilities, and/or confidential or proprietary
data. The Corporation has established security
requirements applicable to third-party service
providers, and where permitted by contract,
cybersecurity diligence is conducted to assess
the alignment of third-party service providers’
cybersecurity programs with the Corporation’s
cybersecurity requirements. While we and our
third parties have experienced cybersecurity
incidents, as well as adverse impacts from such
incidents, we have not experienced material
losses or other material consequences relating to
cybersecurity incidents experienced by us or our
third parties. However, we expect to
continue to experience cybersecurity incidents
resulting in adverse impacts with increased
frequency and severity due to the evolving threat
environment including the increasing use of AI,
such as generative AI and machine learning, for
cybersecurity threat and cyberattack purposes,
and there can be no assurance that future
cybersecurity incidents, including incidents
experienced by our third parties, will not have a
material adverse impact on the Corporation,
including its business strategy, results of
operations and/or financial condition.
 Governance 
Through established governance structures, the
Corporation has policies and procedures to help
facilitate oversight of cybersecurity risk. In
accordance with these policies and procedures,
the Corporation’s three lines of defense, and
management, strive to prepare for, identify,
prevent, detect, mitigate, respond to and recover
from cybersecurity threats and incidents, monitor
performance, and escalate to executive
management, the committees of the Corporation’s
Board and/or to the Board, as appropriate.
Additionally, GIS reports cybersecurity incidents
that meet certain criteria to the Legal
Department for evaluation of materiality and
potential escalation and disclosure, which
includes the consideration of relevant
quantitative and qualitative factors. The Board
is actively engaged in the oversight of the GIS
Program and devotes time and attention to the
oversight and mitigation of cybersecurity risk.
The Board, which includes members with technology
and cybersecurity experience, oversees
management’s approach to staffing and the
policies and procedures to address cybersecurity
risk. The Board and its ERC, which is responsible
for reviewing cybersecurity risk, each receive
regular presentations, memoranda and reports from
our Chief Technology and Information Officer
(CTIO) and our Chief Information Security Officer
(CISO)on internal and external cybersecurity
developments, threats and risks. The
Boardreceives prompt and timely information from
management on cybersecurity incidents, including
cybersecurity incidents experienced by the
Corporation’s third-party service providers, that
may pose significant risk to the Corporation, and
continues to receive regular reports on any such
incidents until their conclusion. Additionally,
the Board receives quarterly reports on the
performance metrics for the GIS Program and the
performance of the Corporation’s cybersecurity
risk appetite metrics, including metrics on
vulnerabilities and third-party cybersecurity
risks and incidents, and is notified promptly if
a Board-level cybersecurity risk limit is
breached. Our ERC also annually reviews and
approves our GIS Program and our Information
Security Policy, which establish administrative,
technical, and physical safeguards designed to
protect the security, confidentiality,
availability and integrity of customer records
and information in accordance with the Gramm-
Leach-Bliley Act and the interagency guidelines
issued thereunder, and applicable laws globally.
Under the Board’s oversight, management works
closely with key stakeholders, including
regulators, government agencies, law enforcement,
peer institutions and industry groups, and
develops and invests in talent and innovative
technology in order to better manage
cybersecurity risk. Our most senior cybersecurity
employees are the CTIO and CISO, who are
primarily responsible for managing and assessing
cybersecurity risk. The CISO oversees a team of
more than 3,400 information security
professionals spanning the globe. The CISO and
the GIS senior leadership team have deep
cybersecurity expertise, with over 200 years of
collective
 81Bank of America 
experience working in the cybersecurity field, at
the Corporation, in government, and other
companies in various industries. Additionally,
certain members of the GIS leadership team hold
leadership roles in sector-specific information
and infrastructure security organizations,
including the Financial Services Information
Sharing and Analysis Center and the Financial
Services Sector Coordinating Council. Employees
across the Corporation also play a role in
protecting the Corporation from cybersecurity
threats and receive periodic training and
education on cybersecurity-related topics.
 Reputational Risk Management 
Reputational risk is the risk that negative
perception of the Corporation may adversely
impact profitability or operations. Reputational
risk may result from many of the Corporation’s
activities, including those related to the
management of strategic, operational, compliance,
liquidity, market (price and interest rate) and
credit risks.
The Corporation manages reputational risk through
established policies and controls embedded
throughout its business and risk management
processes. We proactively monitor and identify
potential reputational risk events and have
processes established to mitigate reputational
risks in a timely manner. If reputational risk
events occur, we focus on remediating the
underlying issue and taking action to minimize
damage to the Corporation’s reputation. The
Corporation has processes in place to respond to
events that give rise to reputational risk,
including educating, using policy influencers and
implementing communication strategies, as
applicable, to mitigate the impact. The
Corporation’s organization and governance
structure provides oversight of reputational
risks through management and Board or Board
committees. Each FLU has a MRC that is
responsible for the oversight of reputational
risk, including approval for business activities
that present elevated levels of reputational
risks. Additionally, reputational risk reporting
is provided to senior management and the Board
regularly.
 Climate Risk Management 
Climate risk is divided into two major
categories, both of which span the seven key risk
types discussed in Managing Risk on page 45: (1)
Physical Risk: risks related to the physical
impacts of climate change, driven by extreme
weather events such as hurricanes and floods, as
well as chronic longer-term shifts such as rising
average global temperatures and sea levels, and
(2) Transition Risk: risks related to the
transition to a low-carbon economy, which may
entail extensive policy, legal, technology and
market changes.
Physical risks of climate change, such as more
frequent and severe extreme weather events, can
increase the Corporation’s risks, including
credit risk by diminishing borrowers’ repayment
capacity or collateral values, and operational
risk by negatively impacting the Corporation’s
facilities, employees, or third parties.
Transition risks of climate change may amplify
credit risks through the financial impacts of
changes in policy, technology or the market on
the Corporation or our counterparties.
Unanticipated market changes can lead to sudden
price adjustments and give rise to heightened
market risk.
Our approach to managing climate risk is
consistent with our risk management governance
structure, from senior management to our Board
and its committees, including the ERC and the
Corporate Governance, ESG and Sustainability
Committee (CGESC) of the Board, which regularly
discuss climate-related topics. The ERC oversees
climate risk as set
forth in our Risk Framework and Risk Appetite
Statement. The CGESC is responsible for
overseeing the Corporation’s environmental and
sustainability-related activities and practices,
and regularly reviews the Corporation’s climate-
related policies and practices.
Our Climate Risk Council consists of leaders
across risk, FLU and control functions, and meets
routinely to discuss our approach to managing
climate-related risks. Our climate risk
management efforts are overseen by an officer who
reports to the CRO. The Corporation has a Climate
and Environmental Risk Management function that
is responsible for overseeing climate risk
management. They are responsible for establishing
the Climate Risk Framework (described below) and
governance structure, and providing an
independent assessment of enterprise-wide climate
risks.
Based on the Corporation’s Risk Framework, we
created our internal Climate Risk Framework,
which addresses various global climate-related
laws, rules, regulations and guidance. The
framework describes how the Corporation
identifies, measures, monitors and controls
climate risk by enhancing existing risk
management processes, includes examples of how
climate risk manifests across the seven risk
types, and details the roles and responsibilities
for climate risk management across our three
lines of defense (i.e., FLUs, Global Risk
Management and Corporate Audit).
For more information on our governance framework,
see Managing Risk on page 45. For more
information on climate risk, see Item 1A. Risk
Factors on page 8. For more information on
climate- and sustainability-related matters and
their importance in supporting our customers and
clients, see the Corporation’s website, including
its 2024 Sustainability at Bank of America
document. The contents of the Corporation’s
website, including the 2024 Sustainability at
Bank of America document, are not incorporated by
reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Complex Accounting Estimates 
Our significant accounting principles, as
described in Note 1 – Summary of Significant
Accounting Principles to the Consolidated
Financial Statements, are essential in
understanding the MD&A. Many of our significant
accounting principles require complex judgments
to estimate the values of assets and liabilities.
We have procedures and processes in place to
facilitate making these judgments.
The more judgmental estimates are summarized in
the following discussion. We have identified and
described the development of the variables most
important in the estimation processes that
involve mathematical models to derive the
estimates. In many cases, there are numerous
alternative judgments that could be used in the
process of determining the inputs to the models.
Where alternatives exist, we have used the
factors that we believe represent the most
reasonable value in developing the inputs. Actual
performance that differs from our estimates of
the key variables could materially impact our
results of operations. Separate from the possible
future impact to our results of operations from
input and model variables, the value of our
lending portfolio and market-sensitive assets and
liabilities may change subsequent to the balance
sheet date, often significantly, due to the
nature and magnitude of future credit and market
conditions. Such credit and market conditions may
change quickly and in unforeseen ways and the
resulting volatility could have a significant,
negative effect on future operating results.
These fluctuations would not be indicative of
deficiencies in our models or inputs.
 Bank of America82 
Allowance for Credit Losses The allowance for
credit losses includes the allowance for loan and
lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending
commitments. Our process for determining the
allowance for credit losses is discussed in Note
1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles
and Note 5 – Outstanding Loans and Leases and
Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated
Financial Statements. The determination of the
allowance for credit losses is based on numerous
estimates and assumptions, which require a high
degree of judgment and are often interrelated. A
critical judgment in the process is the weighting
of our forward-looking macroeconomic scenarios
that are incorporated into our quantitative
models. As any one economic outlook is inherently
uncertain, the Corporation uses multiple
macroeconomic scenarios in its expected credit
losses (ECL) calculation, which have included a
baseline scenario derived from consensus
estimates, an adverse scenario reflecting a
moderate recession, a downside scenario
reflecting continued inflation and interest rates
above the baseline scenario, a tail risk scenario
similar to the severely adverse scenario used in
stress testing and an upside scenario that
considers the potential for improvement above the
baseline scenario. The overall economic outlook
is weighted to reflect a moderate growth
environment, with lower gross domestic product
(GDP) growth and higher unemployment rate
expectations as compared to what we experienced
in 2024. Generally, as the consensus estimates
improve or deteriorate, the allowance for credit
losses will change in a similar direction. There
are multiple variables that drive the
macroeconomic scenarios with the key variables
including, but not limited to, U.S. real GDP and
unemployment rates. As of December 31, 2024, the
latest consensus estimate for the U.S. average
unemployment rate for the fourth quarter of 2024
was 4.2 percent, and U.S. real GDP was forecasted
to grow 2.4 percent year-over-year in the fourth
quarter of 2024, reflecting a strong labor market
and steady growth compared to our macroeconomic
outlook as of December 31, 2023, and were
factored into our allowance for credit losses
estimate as of December 31, 2024. In addition,
the table below presents the weighted
macroeconomic outlook for U.S. average
unemployment rate and U.S. real GDP.
 Table 45 Key Allowance Variables 
 Quarterly Average 
 4Q Year 1(1) 4Q Year 2(1)

 December 31, 2024 forecast 1.4 1.8 
(1) Represents the forecasted weighted economic outlook one and two years out from the reporting
date. In addition to the above judgments and estimates, the allowance for credit losses can also be
impacted by unanticipated changes in asset quality of the portfolio, such as increases or decreases
in credit and/or internal risk ratings in our commercial portfolio, improvement or deterioration in
borrower delinquencies or credit scores in our credit card portfolio and increases or decreases in
home prices, which is a primary driver of LTVs, in our consumer real estate portfolio, all
of which have some degree of uncertainty. The allowance for credit losses decreased $215 million from
$14.6 billion at December 31, 2023 to $14.3 billion at December 31, 2024, primarily due to a reserve
release in our commercial portfolio due to a favorable macroeconomic environment and reduced exposure
in our commercial real estate portfolio. To provide an illustration of the sensitivity of the
macroeconomic scenarios and other assumptions on the estimate of our allowance for credit losses, the
Corporation compared the December 31, 2024 modeled ECL from the baseline scenario to our adverse
scenario. Relative to the baseline scenario, the adverse scenario assumed a peak U.S. unemployment
rate of over two percentage points higher than the baseline scenario, a decline in U.S. real GDP
followed by a prolonged recovery and a lower home price outlook with a difference of approximately 19
percent at the trough. This sensitivity analysis resulted in a hypothetical increase in the allowance
for credit losses of approximately $4.8 billion. While the sensitivity analysis may be useful to
consider how changes in certain macroeconomic assumptions could impact our baseline ECLs, it should
not be relied upon as a forecast of how our allowance for credit losses is expected to change in a
different macroeconomic outlook. Ultimately, the estimate of the allowance for credit losses is
dependent upon a variety of potential factors including, but not limited to, qualitative assessments,
weighting of alternate macroeconomic scenarios and changes in portfolio mix that would need to be
considered comprehensively in determining the allowance for credit losses. Due to the uncertainty in
predicting these factors, they are not incorporated into the sensitivity analysis. Fair Value of
Financial Instruments Under applicable accounting standards, we are required to maximize the use of
observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs in measuring fair value. We classify
fair value measurements of financial instruments and MSRs based on the three-level fair value
hierarchy in the accounting standards. The fair values of assets and liabilities may include
adjustments, such as market liquidity and credit quality, where appropriate. Valuations of products
using models or other techniques are sensitive to assumptions used for the significant inputs. Where
market data is available, the inputs used for valuation reflect that information as of our valuation
date. Inputs to valuation models are considered unobservable if they are supported by little or no
market activity. In periods of extreme volatility, lessened liquidity or in illiquid markets, there
may be more variability in market pricing or a lack of market data to use in the valuation process.
In keeping with the prudent application of estimates and management judgment in determining the fair
value of assets and liabilities, we have in place various processes and controls that include: a
model validation policy that requires review and approval of quantitative models used for deal
pricing, financial statement fair value determination and risk quantification; a trading product
valuation policy that requires verification of all traded product valuations; and a periodic review
and substantiation of daily profit and loss reporting for all traded products. Primarily through
validation controls, we utilize both broker and pricing service inputs which can and do include both
market-observable and internally-modeled values and/or valuation inputs. Our reliance on this
information is affected by our understanding of how the broker and/or pricing service develops its
data with a higher degree of reliance applied to those that are more directly observable and lesser
reliance applied to those developed through their own
 83Bank of America 
internal modeling. For example, broker quotes in
less active markets may only be indicative and
therefore less reliable. These processes and
controls are performed independently of the
business. For more information, see Note 20 –
Fair Value Measurements and Note 21 – Fair Value
Option to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Level 3 Assets and Liabilities Financial assets
and liabilities, and MSRs, where values are based
on valuation techniques that require inputs that
are both unobservable and are significant to the
overall fair value measurement are classified as
Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy
established in applicable accounting standards.
The fair value of these Level 3 financial assets
and liabilities and MSRs is determined using
pricing models, discounted cash flow
methodologies or similar techniques for which the
determination of fair value requires significant
management judgment or estimation. Level 3
financial instruments may be hedged with
derivatives classified as Level 1 or 2;
therefore, gains or losses associated with Level
3 financial instruments may be offset by gains or
losses associated with financial instruments
classified in other levels of the fair value
hierarchy. The Level 3 gains and losses recorded
in earnings did not have a significant impact on
our liquidity or capital. We conduct a review of
our fair value hierarchy classifications on a
quarterly basis. Transfers into or out of Level 3
are made if the significant inputs used in
financial models measuring the fair values of the
assets and liabilities became unobservable or
observable, respectively, in the current
marketplace, or when previously insignificant
unobservable and observable inputs become
significant, respectively. For more information
on transfers into and out of Level 3 during 2024,
2023 and 2022, see Note 20 – Fair Value
Measurements to the Consolidated Financial
Statements. Accrued Income Taxes and Deferred Tax
Assets Accrued income taxes, reported as a
component of either other assets or accrued
expenses and other liabilities on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet, represent the net
amount of current income taxes we expect to pay
to or receive from various taxing jurisdictions
attributable to our operations to date. We
currently file income tax returns in more than
100 jurisdictions and consider many factors,
including statutory, judicial and regulatory
guidance, in estimating the appropriate accrued
income taxes for each jurisdiction. Net deferred
tax assets, reported as a component of other
assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet,
represent the net decrease in taxes expected to
be paid in the future because of net operating
loss (NOL) and tax credit carryforwards and
because of future reversals of temporary
differences in the
bases of assets and liabilities as measured by
tax laws and their bases as reported in the
financial statements. NOL and tax credit
carryforwards result in reductions to future tax
liabilities, and many of these attributes can
expire if not utilized within certain periods. We
consider the need for valuation allowances to
reduce net deferred tax assets to the amounts
that we estimate are more likely than not to be
realized. Consistent with the applicable
accounting guidance, we monitor relevant tax
authorities and change our estimates of accrued
income taxes and/or net deferred tax assets due
to changes in income tax laws and their
interpretation by the courts and regulatory
authorities. These revisions of our estimates,
which also may result from our income tax
planning and from the resolution of income tax
audit matters, may be material to our operating
results for any given period. See Note 19 –
Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for a table of significant tax
attributes and additional information. For more
information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors –
Regulatory, Compliance and Legal. Goodwill and
Intangible Assets The nature of and accounting
for goodwill and intangible assets are discussed

assessment. Factors considered in the qualitative
assessment include, among others, macroeconomic
conditions, industry and market considerations,
financial performance of the respective reporting
unit and other relevant entity and reporting-unit

Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
The management of Bank of America Corporation is
responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial
reporting.
The Corporation’s internal control over financial
reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. The
Corporation’s internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures
that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records
that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the Corporation; (ii) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America, and that receipts and
expenditures of the Corporation are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the Corporation; and
(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the
Corporation’s assets that could have a material
effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or
that the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate.
Management assessed the effectiveness of the
Corporation’s internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2024 based on the
framework set forth by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission in Internal Control – Integrated
Framework (2013) . Based on that assessment,
management concluded that, as of December 31,
2024, the Corporation’s internal control over
financial reporting is effective.
The Corporation’s internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been
audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers , LLP , an
independent registered public accounting firm, as
stated in their accompanying report which
expresses an unqualified opinion on the
effectiveness of the Corporation’s internal
control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2024.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
Bank of America Corporation
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal
Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Bank of America Corporation and
its subsidiaries (the “Corporation”) as of
December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related
consolidated statements of income, comprehensive
income, changes in shareholders’ equity and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2024, including the related
notes (collectively referred to as the
“consolidated financial statements”). We also
have audited the Corporation's internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024,
based on criteria established in Internal Control
- Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of
the Corporation as of December 31, 2024 and 2023,
and the results of its operations and its cash
flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2024 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. Also in our opinion,
the Corporation maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2024,
based on criteria established in Internal Control
- Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.
 Basis for Opinions 
The Corporation’s management is responsible for
these consolidated financial statements, for
maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting, and for its assessment of
the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting, included in the accompanying
Report of Management on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to
express opinions on the Corporation’s
consolidated financial statements and on the
Corporation's internal control over financial
reporting based on our audits. We are a public
accounting firm registered with the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States) (PCAOB) and are required to be
independent with respect to the Corporation in
accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws
and the applicable rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the
consolidated financial statements are free of
material misstatement, whether due to error or
fraud, and whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects. Our audits of the consolidated
financial statements included performing
procedures to assess the risks of material
misstatement of the consolidated financial
statements, whether due to error or fraud, and
performing procedures that respond to those
risks. Such procedures included examining, on a
test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and
disclosures in the consolidated financial
statements. Our audits also included evaluating
the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of the
consolidated financial statements. Our audit of
internal control over financial reporting
included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal
control based on the assessed risk. Our audits
also included performing such other procedures as
we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control
over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial
reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. A company’s internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii)
provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation
of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and
that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations
of management and directors of the company; and
(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s
assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or
that the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate.
 Critical Audit Matters 
The critical audit matters communicated below are
matters arising from the current period audit of
the consolidated financial statements that were
communicated or required to be communicated to
the audit committee and that (i) relate to
accounts or disclosures that are material to the
consolidated financial statements and (ii)
involved our especially challenging, subjective,
or complex judgments. The communication of
critical audit matters does not alter in any way
our opinion on the consolidated financial
statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by
communicating the critical audit matters below,
providing separate opinions on the critical audit
matters or on the accounts or disclosures to
which they relate.
Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses - Commercial
and Consumer Card Loans
As described in Notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated
financial statements, the allowance for loan and
lease losses represents management’s estimate of
the expected credit losses in the Corporation’s
loan and lease portfolio, excluding loans and
unfunded lending commitments accounted for under
the fair value option. As of December 31, 2024,
the allowance for loan and lease losses was $13.2
billion on total loans and leases of $1,091.6
billion, which excludes loans accounted for under
the fair value option. For commercial and
consumer card loans, the expected credit loss is
typically estimated using quantitative methods
that consider a variety of factors such as
historical
 Bank of America88 
loss experience, the current credit quality of
the portfolio as well as an economic outlook over
the life of the loan. In its loss forecasting
framework, the Corporation incorporates forward
looking information through the use of
macroeconomic scenarios applied over the
forecasted life of the assets. These
macroeconomic scenarios include variables that
have historically been key drivers of increases
and decreases in credit losses. These variables
include, but are not limited to, unemployment
rates, real estate prices, gross domestic product
levels and corporate bond spreads. The scenarios
that are chosen and the weighting given to each
scenario depend on a variety of factors including
recent economic events, leading economic
indicators, views of internal as well as third-
party economists and industry trends. Also
included in the allowance for loan and lease
losses are qualitative reserves to cover losses
that are expected but, in the Corporation's
assessment, may not be adequately reflected in
the quantitative methods or the economic
assumptions. Factors that the Corporation
considers include changes in lending policies and
procedures, business conditions, the nature and
size of the portfolio, portfolio concentrations,
the volume and severity of past due loans and
nonaccrual loans, the effect of external factors
such as competition, and legal and regulatory
requirements, among others. Further, the
Corporation considers the inherent uncertainty in
quantitative models that are built on historical
data.
The principal considerations for our
determination that performing procedures relating
to the allowance for loan and lease losses for
the commercial and consumer card portfolios is a
critical audit matter are (i) the significant
judgment and estimation by management in
developing lifetime economic forecast scenarios
and related weightings to each scenario, which in
turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment,
subjectivity and effort in performing procedures
and in evaluating audit evidence obtained, and
(ii) the audit effort involved professionals with
specialized skill and knowledge.
Addressing the matter involved performing
procedures and evaluating audit evidence in
connection with forming our overall opinion on
the consolidated financial statements. These
procedures included testing the effectiveness of
controls relating to the allowance for loan and
lease losses, including controls over the
evaluation and approval of models, forecast
scenarios and related weightings, and qualitative
reserves. These procedures also included, among
others, testing management’s process for
estimating the allowance for loan and lease
losses, including (i) evaluating the
appropriateness of the loss forecast models and
methodology, (ii) evaluating the reasonableness
of certain macroeconomic variables, (iii)
evaluating the reasonableness of management’s
development, selection and weighting of lifetime
economic forecast scenarios used in the loss
forecast models, (iv) testing the completeness
and accuracy of data used in the estimate, and
(v) evaluating the reasonableness of certain
qualitative reserves made to the model output
results to determine the overall allowance for
loan and lease losses. The procedures also
included the involvement of professionals with
specialized skill and knowledge to assist in
evaluating the appropriateness of certain loss
forecast models, the reasonableness of economic
forecast scenarios
and related weightings and the reasonableness of
certain qualitative reserves.
Valuation of Certain Level 3 Financial
Instruments
As described in Notes 1 and 20 to the
consolidated financial statements, the
Corporation carries certain financial instruments
at fair value, which includes $10.0 billion of
assets and $6.3 billion of liabilities classified
as Level 3 fair value measurements that are
valued on a recurring basis and $3.1 billion of
assets classified as Level 3 fair value
measurements that are valued on a nonrecurring
basis, for which the determination of fair value
requires significant management judgment or
estimation. The Corporation determines the fair
value of Level 3 financial instruments using
pricing models, discounted cash flow
methodologies, or similar techniques that require
inputs that are both unobservable and are
significant to the overall fair value
measurement. Unobservable inputs, such as
volatility or implied yield, may be determined
using quantitative-based extrapolations, pricing
models or other internal methodologies which
incorporate management estimates and available
market information.
The principal considerations for our
determination that performing procedures relating
to the valuation of certain Level 3 financial
instruments is a critical audit matter are the
significant judgment and estimation used by
management to determine the fair value of these
financial instruments, which in turn led to a
high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and
effort in performing procedures and in evaluating
audit evidence obtained, including the
involvement of professionals with specialized
skill and knowledge.
Addressing the matter involved performing
procedures and evaluating audit evidence in
connection with forming our overall opinion on
the consolidated financial statements. These
procedures included testing the effectiveness of
controls relating to the valuation of financial
instruments, including controls related to
valuation models, significant unobservable
inputs, and data. These procedures also included,
among others, the involvement of professionals
with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in
developing an independent estimate of fair value
for a sample of these certain financial
instruments and comparison of management’s
estimate to the independently developed estimate
of fair value. Developing the independent
estimate involved testing the completeness and
accuracy of data provided by management and
evaluating the reasonableness of management’s
significant unobservable inputs.

 Bank of America Corporation and Subsidiaries 
 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
NOTE 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles
Bank of America Corporation, a bank holding company and a financial holding company, provides a
diverse range of financial services and products throughout the U.S. and in certain international
markets. The term “the Corporation” as used herein may refer to Bank of America Corporation,
individually, Bank of America Corporation and its subsidiaries, or certain of Bank of America
Corporation’s subsidiaries or affiliates. Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation The
Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Corporation and its majority-owned
subsidiaries and those variable interest entities (VIEs) where the Corporation is the primary
beneficiary. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Results of operations of
acquired companies are included from the dates of acquisition, and for VIEs, from the dates that the
Corporation became the primary beneficiary. Assets held in an agency or fiduciary capacity are not
included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Corporation accounts for investments in
companies for which it owns a voting interest and for which it has the ability to exercise
significant influence over operating and financing decisions using the equity method of accounting.
These investments, which include the Corporation’s interests in affordable housing and renewable
energy partnerships, are recorded in other assets. Equity method investments are subject to
impairment testing, and the Corporation’s proportionate share of income or loss is included in other
income. The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect reported amounts and disclosures. Actual results could materially differ
from those estimates and assumptions. New Accounting Standard Adopted Segment Reporting The Financial
Accounting Standards Board amended the segment reporting requirements to add disclosures of
incremental segment expense categories. The Corporation adopted this guidance effective January 1,
2024 on a retrospective basis.The additional disclosures are included in Note 23 – Business Segment
Information . Significant Accounting Principles Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents
include cash on hand, cash items in the process of collection, cash segregated under federal and
other brokerage regulations, and amounts due from correspondent banks, the Federal Reserve Bank and
certain non-U.S. central banks. Certain cash balances are restricted as to withdrawal or usage by
legally binding contractual agreements or regulatory requirements. Securities Financing Agreements
Securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell and securities loaned or sold under
agreements to repurchase (securities financing agreements) are treated as collateralized financing
transactions except in instances where the transaction
is required to be accounted for as individual sale and purchase transactions. Generally, these
agreements are recorded at acquisition or sale price plus accrued interest. In instances where the
interest is negative, the Corporation’s policy is to present negative interest on financial assets as
interest income and negative interest on financial liabilities as interest expense. For securities
financing agreements that are accounted for under the fair value option, the changes in the fair
value of these securities financing agreements are recorded in market making and similar activities
in the Consolidated Statement of Income. The Corporation’s policy is to monitor the market value of
the principal amount loaned under resale agreements and obtain collateral from or return collateral
pledged to counterparties when appropriate. Securities financing agreements do not create material
credit risk due to these collateral provisions; therefore, any allowance for loan losses is
insignificant. In transactions where the Corporation acts as the lender in a securities lending
agreement and receives securities that can be pledged or sold as collateral, it recognizes an asset
on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value, representing the securities received, and a
liability, representing the obligation to return those securities. Trading Instruments Financial
instruments utilized in trading activities are carried at fair value. Fair value is generally based
on quoted market prices for the same or similar assets and liabilities. If these market prices are
not available, fair values are estimated based on dealer quotes, pricing models, discounted cash flow
methodologies, or similar techniques where the determination of fair value may require significant
management judgment or estimation. Realized gains and losses are recorded on a trade-date basis.
Realized and unrealized gains and losses are recognized in market making and similar activities.
Derivatives and Hedging Activities Derivatives are entered into on behalf of customers, for trading
or to support risk management activities. Derivatives used in risk management activities include
derivatives that are both designated in qualifying accounting hedge relationships and derivatives
used to hedge market risks in relationships that are not designated in qualifying accounting hedge
relationships (referred to as other risk management activities). The Corporation manages interest
rate and foreign currency exchange rate sensitivity predominantly through the use of derivatives.
Derivatives utilized by the Corporation include swaps, futures and forward settlement contracts, and
option contracts. All derivatives are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value,
taking into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements that allow the
Corporation to settle positive and negative positions and offset cash collateral held with the same
counterparty on a net basis. For exchange-traded contracts, fair value is based on quoted market
prices in active or inactive markets or is derived from observable market-based pricing parameters,
similar to those applied to over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives. For non-exchange traded contracts,
fair value is based on dealer quotes, pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar
techniques for which the determination of fair value may require significant management judgment or
estimation.
 Bank of America94 
Valuations of derivative assets and liabilities reflect the fair value of the instrument including
counterparty credit risk and the Corporation’s own credit standing, as applicable. Trading
Derivatives and Other Risk Management Activities Derivatives held for trading purposes are included
in derivative assets or derivative liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet with changes in fair
value included in market making and similar activities. Derivatives used for other risk management
activities are included in derivative assets or derivative liabilities. Derivatives used in other
risk management activities have not been designated in qualifying accounting hedge relationships
because they did not qualify or the risk that is being mitigated pertains to an item that is reported
at fair value through earnings so that the effect of measuring the derivative instrument and the
asset or liability to which the risk exposure pertains will offset in the Consolidated Statement of
Income to the extent effective. The changes in the fair value of derivatives that serve to mitigate
certain risks associated with mortgage servicing rights (MSRs), interest rate lock commitments
(IRLCs) and first-lien mortgage loans held-for-sale (LHFS) that are originated by the Corporation are
recorded in other income. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that serve to mitigate interest
rate risk and foreign currency risk are included in market making and similar activities. Credit
derivatives are also used by the Corporation to mitigate the risk associated with various credit
exposures. The changes in the fair value of these derivatives are included in market making and
similar activities and other income. Derivatives Used For Hedge Accounting Purposes (Accounting
Hedges) For accounting hedges, the Corporation formally documents at inception all relationships
between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as the risk management objectives and
strategies for undertaking various accounting hedges. The Corporation primarily uses regression
analysis at the inception of a hedge and for each reporting period thereafter to assess whether the
derivative used in an accounting hedge transaction is expected to be and has been highly effective in
offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of a hedged item or forecasted transaction. The
Corporation discontinues hedge accounting when it is determined that a derivative is not expected to
be or has ceased to be highly effective as a hedge. Additionally, the Corporation may choose to
discontinue a hedge relationship at any time. Fair value hedges are used to protect against changes
in the fair value of the Corporation’s assets and liabilities that are attributable to interest rate
or foreign exchange volatility. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as fair value
hedges are recorded in earnings, together and in the same income statement line item with changes in
the fair value of the related hedged item. If a derivative instrument in a fair value hedge is
terminated or the hedge designation removed, the previous adjustments to the carrying value of the
hedged asset or liability are subsequently accounted for in the same manner as other components of
the carrying value of that asset or liability. For interest-earning assets and interest-bearing
liabilities, such adjustments are amortized to earnings over the remaining life of the respective
asset or liability. Cash flow hedges are used primarily to minimize the variability in cash flows of
assets and liabilities or forecasted transactions caused by interest rate or foreign exchange rate
fluctuations. The Corporation also uses cash flow hedges to hedge the price risk associated with
deferred compensation. Changes in the fair value of derivatives used in cash flow hedges are recorded
in accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI) and are reclassified into the line item in the income
statement in which the hedged item is recorded in the same period the hedged item affects earnings.
Components of a derivative that are excluded in assessing hedge effectiveness are recorded in the
same income statement line item as the hedged item. Net investment hedges are used to manage the
foreign exchange rate sensitivity arising from a net investment in a foreign operation. Changes in
the spot prices of derivatives that are designated as net investment hedges of foreign operations are
recorded as a component of accumulated OCI. The remaining components of these derivatives are
excluded in assessing hedge effectiveness and are recorded in market making and similar activities.
Securities Debt securities are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at their trade date. Their
classification is dependent on the purpose for which the securities were acquired. Debt securities
purchased for use in the Corporation’s trading activities are reported in trading account assets at
fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in market making and similar activities.
Substantially all other debt securities purchased are used in the Corporation’s asset and liability
management (ALM) activities and are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as either debt
securities carried at fair value or as held-to-maturity (HTM) debt securities. Debt securities
carried at fair value are either available-for-sale (AFS) securities with unrealized gains and losses
net-of-tax included in accumulated OCI or carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses
reported in market making and similar activities. HTM debt securities are debt securities that
management has the intent and ability to hold to maturity and are reported at amortized cost. If more
than 85percent of the principal has been collected on level-payment mortgage-backed HTM debt
securities since their acquisition, the debt securities, if disposed, are treated as matured for
classification purposes. The Corporation evaluates each AFS security where the value has declined
below amortized cost. If the Corporation intends to sell or believes it is more likely than not that
it will be required to sell the debt security, it is written down to fair value through earnings. For
AFS debt securities the Corporation intends to hold, the Corporation evaluates the debt securities
for ECL, except for debt securities that are guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury, U.S. government
agencies or sovereign entities of high credit quality where the Corporation applies a zero credit
loss assumption. For the remaining AFS debt securities, the Corporation considers qualitative
parameters such as internal and external credit ratings and the value of underlying collateral. If an
AFS debt security fails any of the qualitative parameters, a discounted cash flow analysis is used by
the Corporation to determine if a portion of the unrealized loss is a result of an ECL. The
Corporation will then recognize either credit loss expense or a reversal of credit loss expense in
other income for the amount necessary to adjust the debt securities valuation allowance to its
current estimate of expected credit losses. Cash flows expected to be collected are estimated using
all relevant information available such as remaining payment terms, prepayment speeds, the financial
condition of the issuer, expected defaults and the value of the underlying collateral. If any of the
decline in fair value is related to market factors, that amount is recognized in accumulated OCI. In
certain instances, the credit loss may exceed the total decline in fair value, in
 95Bank of America 
which case, the allowance recorded is limited to the difference between the amortized cost and the
fair value of the asset. The Corporation separately evaluates its HTM debt securities for any credit
losses, of which substantially all qualify for the zero loss assumption. For the remaining
securities, the Corporation performs a discounted cash flow analysis to estimate any credit losses
which are then recognized as part of the allowance for credit losses. Interest on debt securities,
including amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, is included in interest income.
Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted to interest income at a constant effective yield
over the contractual lives of the securities. Realized gains and losses from the sales or
dispositions of debt securities are determined using the specific identification method. Equity
securities with readily determinable fair values that are not held for trading purposes are carried
at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in other income. Equity securities that do
not have readily determinable fair values are recorded at cost less impairment, if any, plus or minus
qualifying observable price changes. These securities are reported in other assets. Loans and Leases
Loans, with the exception of loans accounted for under the fair value option, are reported at their
outstanding principal balances net of any unearned income, charge-offs, unamortized deferred fees and
costs on originated loans, and for purchased loans, net of any unamortized premiums or discounts.
Loan origination fees and certain direct origination costs are deferred and recognized as adjustments
to interest income over the lives of the related loans. Unearned income, discounts and premiums are
amortized to interest income using a constant effective yield methodology. The Corporation elects to
account for certain consumer and commercial loans under the fair value option with interest reported
in interest income and changes in fair value reported in market making and similar activities or
other income. Under applicable accounting guidance, for reporting purposes, the loan and lease
portfolio is categorized by portfolio segment and, within each portfolio segment, by class of
financing receivable. A portfolio segment is defined as the level at which an entity develops and
documents a systematic methodology to determine the allowance for credit losses, and a class of
financing receivable is defined as the level of disaggregation of portfolio segments based on the
initial measurement attribute, risk characteristics and methods for assessing risk. The Corporation’s
threeportfolio segments are Consumer Real Estate, Credit Card and Other Consumer, and Commercial. The
classes within the Consumer Real Estate portfolio segment are residential mortgage and home equity.
The classes within the Credit Card and Other Consumer portfolio segment are credit card,
direct/indirect consumer and other consumer. The classes within the Commercial portfolio segment are
U.S. commercial, non-U.S. commercial, commercial real estate, commercial lease financing and U.S.
small business commercial. Leases The Corporation provides equipment financing to its customers
through a variety of lessor arrangements. Direct financing leases and sales-type leases are carried
at the aggregate of lease payments receivable plus the estimated residual value of the leased
property less unearned income, which is accreted to interest income over the lease terms using
methods that approximate the interest method. Operating lease income is recognized on a straight-line
basis. The Corporation's lease arrangements generally do not contain non-lease components. Allowance
for Credit Losses The ECL on funded consumer and commercial loans and leases is referred to as the
allowance for loan and lease losses and is reported separately as a contra-asset to loans and leases
on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The ECL for unfunded lending commitments, including home equity
lines of credit (HELOCs), standby letters of credit (SBLCs) and binding unfunded loan commitments is
reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in accrued expenses and other liabilities. The provision
for credit losses related to the loan and lease portfolio and unfunded lending commitments is
reported in the Consolidated Statement of Income at the amount necessary to adjust the allowance for
credit losses to the current estimate of ECL. For loans and leases, the ECL is typically estimated
using quantitative methods that consider a variety of factors such as historical loss experience, the
current credit quality of the portfolio as well as an economic outlook over the life of the loan. The
life of the loan for closed-ended products is based on the contractual maturity of the loan adjusted
for any expected prepayments. The contractual maturity includes any extension options that are at the
sole discretion of the borrower. For open- ended products (e.g., lines of credit), the ECL is
determined based on the maximum repayment term associated with future draws from credit lines unless
those lines of credit are unconditionally cancellable (e.g., credit cards) in which case the
Corporation does not record any allowance. In its loss forecasting framework, the Corporation
incorporates forward-looking information through the use of macroeconomic scenarios applied over the
forecasted life of the assets. These macroeconomic scenarios include variables that have historically
been key drivers of increases and decreases in credit losses. These variables include, but are not
limited to, unemployment rates, real estate prices, gross domestic product levels and corporate bond
spreads. As any one economic outlook is inherently uncertain, the Corporation leverages multiple
scenarios. The scenarios that are chosen each quarter and the weighting given to each scenario depend
on a variety of factors including recent economic events, leading economic indicators, views of
internal and third-party economists and industry trends. The estimate of credit losses includes
expected recoveries of amounts previously charged off (i.e., negative allowance). If a loan has been
charged off, the expected cash flows on the loan are not limited by the current amortized cost
balance. Instead, expected cash flows can be assumed up to the unpaid principal balance immediately
prior to the charge-off. Included in the allowance for loan and lease losses are qualitative reserves
to cover losses that are expected but, in the Corporation's assessment, may not be adequately
reflected in the quantitative methods or the economic assumptions described above. For example,
factors that the Corporation considers include changes in lending policies and procedures, business
conditions, the nature and size of the portfolio, portfolio concentrations, the volume and severity
of past due loans and nonaccrual loans, the effect of external factors such as competition, and legal
and regulatory requirements, among others. Further, the Corporation considers the inherent
uncertainty in quantitative models that are built on historical data. With the exception of the
Corporation's credit card portfolio, the Corporation does not include reserves for interest
receivable
 Bank of America96 
in the measurement of the allowance for credit losses as the Corporation generally classifies
consumer loans as nonperforming at 90days past due and reverses interest income for these loans at
that time. For credit card loans, the Corporation reserves for interest and fees as part of the
allowance for loan and lease losses. Upon charge-off of a credit card loan, the Corporation reverses
the interest and fee income against the income statement line item where it was originally recorded.
The Corporation has identified the following threeportfolio segments and measures the allowance for
credit losses using the following methods. Consumer Real Estate To estimate ECL for consumer loans
secured by residential real estate, the Corporation estimates the number of loans that will default
over the life of the existing portfolio, after factoring in estimated prepayments, using quantitative
modeling methodologies. The attributes that are most significant in estimating the Corporation’s ECL
include refreshed loan-to-value (LTV) or, in the case of a subordinated lien, refreshed combined LTV
(CLTV), borrower credit score, months since origination and geography, all of which are further
broken down by present collection status (whether the loan is current, delinquent, in default, or in
bankruptcy). The estimates are based on the Corporation’s historical experience with the loan
portfolio, adjusted to reflect the economic outlook. The outlook on the unemployment rate and
consumer real estate prices are key factors that impact the frequency and severity of loss estimates.
The Corporation does not reserve for credit losses on the unpaid principal balance of loans insured
by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and long-term standby loans, as these loans are fully
insured. The Corporation records a reserve for unfunded lending commitments for the ECL associated
with the undrawn portion of the Corporation’s HELOCs, which can only be canceled by the Corporation
if certain criteria are met. The ECL associated with these unfunded lending commitments is calculated
using the same models and methodologies noted above and incorporate utilization assumptions at time
of default. For loans that are more than 180days past due, the Corporation bases the allowance on the
estimated fair value of the underlying collateral as of the reporting date less costs to sell. The
fair value of the collateral securing these loans is generally determined using an automated
valuation model (AVM) that estimates the value of a property by reference to market data including
sales of comparable properties and price trends specific to the Metropolitan Statistical Area in
which the property being valued is located. In the event that an AVM value is not available, the
Corporation utilizes publicized indices or if these methods provide less reliable valuations, the
Corporation uses appraisals or broker price opinions to estimate the fair value of the collateral.
While there is inherent imprecision in these valuations, the Corporation believes that they are
representative of this portfolio in the aggregate. For loans that are more than 180days past due,
with the exception of the Corporation’s fully insured portfolio, the outstanding balance of loans
that is in excess of the estimated property value after adjusting for costs to sell is charged off.
If the estimated property value decreases in periods subsequent to the initial charge-off, the
Corporation will record an additional charge-off; however, if the value increases in periods
subsequent to the charge-off, the Corporation will adjust the allowance to account for the increase
but not to a level above the cumulative charge-off amount. Credit Cards and Other Consumer Credit
cards are revolving lines of credit without a defined maturity date. The estimated life of a credit
card receivable is determined by estimating the amount and timing of expected future payments (e.g.,
borrowers making full payments, minimum payments or somewhere in between) that it will take for a
receivable balance to pay off. The ECL on the future payments incorporates the spending behavior of a
borrower through time using key borrower-specific factors and the economic outlook described above.
The Corporation applies all expected payments in accordance with the Credit Card Accountability
Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (i.e., paying down the highest interest rate bucket first).
Then forecasted future payments are prioritized to pay off the oldest balance until it is brought to
zero or an expected charge-off amount. Unemployment rate outlook, borrower credit score, delinquency
status and historical payment behavior are all key inputs into the credit card receivable loss
forecasting model. Future draws on the credit card lines are excluded from the ECL as they are
unconditionally cancellable. The ECL for the consumer vehicle lending portfolio is also determined
using quantitative methods supplemented with qualitative analysis. The quantitative model estimates
ECL giving consideration to key borrower and loan characteristics such as delinquency status,
borrower credit score, LTV ratio, underlying collateral type and collateral value. Commercial The ECL
on commercial loans is forecasted using models that estimate credit losses over the loan’s
contractual life at an individual loan level. The models use the contractual terms to forecast future
principal cash flows while also considering expected prepayments. For open-ended commitments such as
revolving lines of credit, changes in funded balance are captured by forecasting a borrower’s draw
and payment behavior over the remaining life of the commitment. For loans collateralized with
commercial real estate and for which the underlying asset is the primary source of repayment, the
loss forecasting models consider key loan and customer attributes such as LTV ratio, net operating
income and debt service coverage, and captures variations in behavior according to property type and
region. The outlook on the unemployment rate, gross domestic product, and forecasted real estate
prices are utilized to determine indicators such as rent levels and vacancy rates, which impact the
ECL estimate. For all other commercial loans and leases, the loss forecasting model determines the
probabilities of transition to different credit risk ratings or default at each point over the life
of the asset based on the borrower’s current credit risk rating, industry sector, size of the
exposure and the geographic market. The severity of loss is determined based on the type of
collateral securing the exposure, the size of the exposure, the borrower’s industry sector, any
guarantors and the geographic market. Assumptions of expected loss are conditioned to the economic
outlook, and the model considers key economic variables such as unemployment rate, gross domestic
product, corporate bond spreads, real estate and other asset prices and equity market returns. In
addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses, the Corporation also estimates ECL related to
unfunded lending commitments such as letters of credit, financial guarantees, unfunded bankers
acceptances and binding loan commitments, excluding commitments accounted for under the fair value
option. Reserves are estimated for the unfunded exposure using the same models and methodologies as
the funded exposure
 97Bank of America 
and are reported as reserves for unfunded lending commitments. Nonperforming Loans and Leases,
Charge-offs and Delinquencies Nonperforming loans and leases generally include loans and leases that
have been placed on nonaccrual status. Loans accounted for under the fair value option and LHFS are
not reported as nonperforming. When a nonaccrual loan is deemed uncollectible, it is charged off
against the allowance for credit losses. If the charged-off amount is later recovered, the amount is
reversed through the allowance for credit losses at the recovery date. Charge-offs are reported net
of recoveries (net charge-offs). If recoveries for the period are greater than charge- offs, net
charge-offs are reported as a negative amount. In accordance with the Corporation’s policies,
consumer real estate-secured loans, including residential mortgages and home equity loans, are
generally placed on nonaccrual status and classified as nonperforming at 90days past due unless
repayment of the loan is insured by the FHA or through individually insured long-term standby
agreements with Fannie Mae (FNMA) or Freddie Mac (FHLMC) (the fully-insured portfolio). Residential
mortgage loans in the fully-insured portfolio are not placed on nonaccrual status and, therefore, are
not reported as nonperforming. Junior-lien home equity loans are placed on nonaccrual status and
classified as nonperforming when the underlying first-lien mortgage loan becomes 90days past due even
if the junior-lien loan is current. The outstanding balance of real estate-secured loans that is in
excess of the estimated property value less costs to sell is charged off no later than the end of the
month in which the loan becomes 180days past due unless the loan is fully insured, or for loans in
bankruptcy, within 60days of receipt of notification of filing, with the remaining balance classified
as nonperforming. Credit card and other unsecured consumer loans are charged off when the loan
becomes 180days past due, within 60days after receipt of notification of death or bankruptcy or upon
confirmation of fraud. These loans continue to accrue interest until they are charged off and,
therefore, are not reported as nonperforming loans. Consumer vehicle loans are placed on nonaccrual
status when they become 90days past due, within 60days after receipt of notification of bankruptcy or
death or upon confirmation of fraud, unless the borrower’s performance indicates that repayment is
likely to occur. These loans are charged off to the estimated fair value of the collateral less
expected disposal costs when the loans become 120days past due, upon repossession of the collateral,
within 60days after receipt of notification of bankruptcy or death or upon confirmation of fraud, and
when the borrower’s ability to pay cannot be validated. If repossession of the collateral is not
expected, the loans are fully charged off. Commercial loans and leases, excluding business card
loans, that are past due 90days or more as to principal or interest, or where reasonable doubt exists
as to timely collection, including loans that are individually identified as being impaired, are
generally placed on nonaccrual status and classified as nonperforming unless well-secured and in the
process of collection. Business card loans are charged off in the same manner as consumer credit card
loans. Other commercial loans and leases are generally charged off when all or a portion of the
principal amount is determined to be uncollectible. The entire balance of a consumer loan or
commercial loan or lease is contractually delinquent if the minimum payment is not received by the
specified due date on the customer’s billing statement. Interest and fees continue to accrue on past
due loans and leases until the date the loan is placed on nonaccrual status, if applicable. Accrued
interest receivable is reversed when loans and leases are placed on nonaccrual status. Interest
collections on nonaccruing loans and leases for which the ultimate collectability of principal is
uncertain are applied as principal reductions; otherwise, such collections are credited to income
when received. Loans and leases may be restored to accrual status when all principal and interest is
current and full repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is expected. Loans
Held-for-sale Loans that the Corporation intends to sell in the foreseeable future, including
residential mortgages, loan syndications, and to a lesser degree, commercial real estate, consumer
finance and other loans, are reported as LHFS and are carried at the lower of aggregate cost or fair
value. The Corporation accounts for certain LHFS, including residential mortgage LHFS, under the fair
value option. Loan origination costs for LHFS carried at the lower of cost or fair value are
capitalized as part of the carrying value of the loans and, upon the sale of a loan, are recognized
as part of the gain or loss in noninterest income. LHFS that are on nonaccrual status and are
reported as nonperforming, as defined in the policy herein, are reported separately from
nonperforming loans and leases. Premises and Equipment Premises and equipment are carried at cost
less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are recognized using
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Estimated lives range up to
40years for buildings, up to 12years for furniture and equipment, and the shorter of lease term or
estimated useful life for leasehold improvements. Other Assets For the Corporation’s financial assets
that are measured at amortized cost and are not included in debt securities or loans and leases on
the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Corporation evaluates these assets for ECL using various
techniques. For assets that are subject to collateral maintenance provisions, including federal funds
sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell, where the collateral consists
of daily margining of liquid and marketable assets where the margining is expected to be maintained
into the foreseeable future, the expected losses are assumed to be zero. For all other assets, the
Corporation performs qualitative analyses, including consideration of historical losses and current
economic conditions, to estimate any ECL which are then included in a valuation account that is
recorded as a contra-asset against the amortized cost basis of the financial asset. Lessee
Arrangements Substantially all of the Corporation’s lessee arrangements are operating leases. Under
these arrangements, the Corporation records right-of-use assets and lease liabilities at lease
commencement. Right-of-use assets are reported in other assetson the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and
the related lease liabilities are reported in accrued expenses and other liabilities. All leases are
recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet except leases with an initial term less than 12 months for
which the Corporation made the short-term lease election. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-
line basis over the
 Bank of America98 
lease term and is recorded in occupancy and equipment expense in the Consolidated Statement of
Income. The Corporation made an accounting policy election not to separate lease and non-lease
components of a contract that is or contains a lease for its real estate and equipment leases. As
such, lease payments represent payments on both lease and non-lease components. At lease
commencement, lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the remaining lease
payments and discounted using the Corporation’s incremental borrowing rate. Right-of-use assets
initially equal the lease liability, adjusted for any lease payments made prior to lease commencement
and for any lease incentives. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill is the purchase premium after
adjusting for the fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed for
potential impairment on an annual basis, or when events or circumstances indicate a potential
impairment, at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is a business segment or one level below a
business segment. The Corporation assesses the fair value of each reporting unit against its carrying
value, including goodwill, as measured by allocated equity. For purposes of goodwill impairment
testing, the Corporation utilizes allocated equity as a proxy for the carrying value of its reporting
units. Allocated equity in the reporting units is comprised of allocated capital plus capital for the
portion of goodwill and intangibles specifically assigned to the reporting unit. In performing its
goodwill impairment testing, the Corporation first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether
it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value.
Qualitative factors include, among other things, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market
considerations, financial performance of the respective reporting unit and other relevant entity- and
reporting-unit specific considerations. If the Corporation concludes it is more likely than not that
the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative assessment is
performed. The Corporation has an unconditional option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any
reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative goodwill impairment
test. The Corporation may resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period. When
performing the quantitative assessment, if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying
value, goodwill of the reporting unit would not be considered impaired. If the carrying value of the
reporting unit exceeds its fair value, a goodwill impairment loss would be recognized for the amount
by which the reporting unit’s allocated equity exceeds its fair value. An impairment loss recognized
cannot exceed the amount of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit. An impairment loss establishes a
new basis in the goodwill, and subsequent reversals of goodwill impairment losses are not permitted
under applicable accounting guidance. For intangible assets subject to amortization, an impairment
loss is recognized if the carrying value of the intangible asset is not recoverable and exceeds fair
value. The carrying value of the intangible asset is considered not recoverable if it exceeds the sum
of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset. Intangible assets deemed
to have indefinite useful lives are not subject to amortization and are assessed for impairment when
events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value.
Variable Interest Entities A VIE is an entity that lacks equity investors or whose equity investors
do not have a controlling financial interest in the entity through their equity investments. The
Corporation consolidates a VIE if it has both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most
significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and an obligation to absorb losses or the right
to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. On a quarterly basis, the
Corporation reassesses its involvement with the VIE and evaluates the impact of changes in governing
documents and its financial interests in the VIE. The consolidation status of the VIEs with which the
Corporation is involved may change as a result of such reassessments. The Corporation primarily uses
VIEs for its securitization activities, in which the Corporation transfers whole loans or debt
securities into a trust or other vehicle. When the Corporation is the servicer of whole loans held in
a securitization trust, including non-agency residential mortgages, home equity loans, credit cards,
and other loans, the Corporation has the power to direct the most significant activities of the
trust. The Corporation generally does not have the power to direct the most significant activities of
a residential mortgage agency trust except in certain circumstances in which the Corporation holds
substantially all of the issued securities and has the unilateral right to liquidate the trust. The
power to direct the most significant activities of a commercial mortgage securitization trust is
typically held by the special servicer or by the party holding specific subordinate securities which
embody certain controlling rights. The Corporation consolidates a whole-loan securitization trust if
it has the power to direct the most significant activities and also holds securities issued by the
trust or has other contractual arrangements, other than standard representations and warranties, that
could potentially be significant to the trust. The Corporation may also transfer trading account
securities and AFS securities into municipal bond or resecuritization trusts. The Corporation
consolidates a municipal bond or resecuritization trust if it has control over the ongoing activities
of the trust such as the remarketing of the trust’s liabilities or, if there are no ongoing
activities, sole discretion over the design of the trust, including the identification of securities
to be transferred in and the structure of securities to be issued, and also retains securities or has
liquidity or other commitments that could potentially be significant to the trust. The Corporation
does not consolidate a municipal bond or resecuritization trust if one or a limited number of third-
party investors share responsibility for the design of the trust or have control over the significant
activities of the trust through liquidation or other substantive rights.
 99Bank of America 
Other VIEs used by the Corporation include collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), investment
vehicles created on behalf of customers and other investment vehicles. The Corporation does not
routinely serve as collateral manager for CDOs and, therefore, does not typically have the power to
direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of a CDO. However,
following an event of default, if the Corporation is a majority holder of senior securities issued by
a CDO and acquires the power to manage its assets, the Corporation consolidates the CDO. The
Corporation consolidates a customer or other investment vehicle if it has control over the initial
design of the vehicle or manages the assets in the vehicle and also absorbs potentially significant
gains or losses through an investment in the vehicle, derivative contracts or other arrangements. The
Corporation does not consolidate an investment vehicle if a single investor controlled the initial
design of the vehicle or manages the assets in the vehicles or if the Corporation does not have a
variable interest that could potentially be significant to the vehicle. Retained interests in
securitized assets are initially recorded at fair value. In addition, the Corporation may invest in
debt securities issued by unconsolidated VIEs. Fair values of these debt securities, which are
classified as trading account assets, debt securities carried at fair value or HTM securities, are
based primarily on quoted market prices in active or inactive markets. Generally, quoted market
prices for retained residual interests are not available; therefore, the Corporation estimates fair
values based on the present value of the associated expected future cash flows. Fair Value The
Corporation measures the fair values of its assets and liabilities, where applicable, in accordance
with accounting guidance that requires an entity to base fair value on exit price. Under this
guidance, an entity is required to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of
unobservable inputs in measuring fair value. Under applicable accounting standards, fair value
measurements are categorized into one of three levels based on the inputs to the valuation technique
with the highest priority given to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority
given to unobservable inputs. The Corporation categorizes its fair value measurements of financial
instruments based on this three-level hierarchy. Level 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets
for identical assets or liabilities. Level 1 assets and liabilities include debt and equity
securities and derivative contracts that are traded in an active exchange market, as well as certain
U.S. Treasury securities that are highly liquid and are actively traded in OTC markets. Level 2
Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities,
quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be
corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
Level 2 assets and liabilities include debt securities with quoted prices that are traded less
frequently than exchange-traded instruments and derivative contracts where fair value is determined
using a pricing model with inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally
from or corroborated by observable market data. This category generally includes U.S. government and
agency mortgage-backed (MBS) and asset-backed securities (ABS), corporate debt securities, derivative
contracts, certain loans and LHFS. Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no
market activity and that are significant to the overall fair value of the assets or liabilities.
Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments for which the determination of fair
value requires significant management judgment or estimation. The fair value for such assets and
liabilities is generally determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or
similar techniques that incorporate the assumptions a market participant would use in pricing the
asset or liability. This category generally includes retained residual interests in securitizations,
consumer MSRs, certain ABS, highly structured, complex or long-dated derivative contracts, certain
loans and LHFS, IRLCs and certain CDOs where independent pricing information cannot be obtained for a
significant portion of the underlying assets. Income Taxes There are two components of income tax
expense: current and deferred. Current income tax expense reflects taxes to be paid or refunded for
the current period. Deferred income tax expense results from changes in deferred tax assets and
liabilities between periods. These gross deferred tax assets and liabilities represent decreases or
increases in taxes expected to be paid in the future because of future reversals of temporary
differences in the bases of assets and liabilities as measured by tax laws and their bases as
reported in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets are also recognized for tax attributes such
as net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances are recorded
to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts management concludes are more likely than not to be
realized. Income tax benefits are recognized and measured based upon a two-step model: first, a tax
position must be more likely than not to be sustained based solely on its technical merits in order
to be recognized, and second, the benefit is measured as the largest dollar amount of that position
that is more likely than not to be sustained upon settlement. The difference between the benefit
recognized and the tax benefit claimed on a tax return is referred to as an unrecognized tax benefit.
The Corporation records income tax-related interest and penalties, if applicable, within income tax
expense. Revenue Recognition The following summarizes the Corporation’s revenue recognition
accounting policies for certain noninterest income activities. Card Income Card income includes
annual, late and over-limit fees as well as interchange, cash advances and other miscellaneous items
from credit and debit card transactions and from processing card transactions for merchants. Card
income is presented net of direct costs. Interchange fees are recognized upon settlement of the
credit and debit card payment transactions and are generally determined on a percentage basis for
credit cards and fixed rates for debit cards based on the corresponding payment network’s rates.
Substantially all card fees are recognized at the transaction date, except for certain time-based
fees such as annual fees, which are recognized over 12 months. Fees charged to cardholders and
merchants that are estimated to be uncollectible are reserved in the allowance for loan and lease
losses. Included in direct cost are rewards
 Bank of America100 
and credit card partner payments. Rewards paid to
cardholders are related to points earned by the
cardholder that can be redeemed for a broad range
of rewards including cash, travel and gift cards.
The points to be redeemed are estimated based on
past redemption behavior, card product type,
account transaction activity and other historical
card performance. The liability is reduced as the
points are redeemed. The Corporation also makes
payments to credit card partners. The payments
are based on revenue-sharing agreements that are
generally driven by cardholder transactions and
partner sales volumes. As part of the revenue-
sharing agreements, the credit card partner
provides the Corporation exclusive rights to
market to the credit card partner’s members or
customers on behalf of the Corporation. Service
Charges Service charges include deposit and
lending-related fees. Deposit-related fees
consist of fees earned on consumer and commercial
deposit activities and are generally recognized
when the transactions occur or as the service is
performed. Consumer fees are earned on consumer
deposit accounts for account maintenance and
various transaction-based services, such as ATM
transactions, wire transfer activities, check and
money order processing and insufficient
funds/overdraft transactions. Commercial deposit-
related fees are from the Corporation’s Global
Transaction Services business and consist of
commercial deposit and treasury management
services, including account maintenance and other
services, such as payroll, sweep account and
other cash management services. Lending-related
fees generally represent transactional fees
earned from certain loan commitments, financial
guarantees and SBLCs. Investment and Brokerage
Services Investment and brokerage services
consist of asset management and brokerage fees.
Asset management fees are earned from the
management of client assets under advisory
agreements or the full discretion of the
Corporation’s financial advisors (collectively
referred to as assets under management (AUM)).
Asset management fees are earned as a percentage
of the client’s AUM and generally range from
50basis points (bps) to 150bps of the AUM. In
cases where a third party is used to obtain a
client’s investment allocation, the fee remitted
to the third party is recorded net and is not
reflected in the transaction price, as the
Corporation is an agent for those services.
Brokerage fees include income earned from
transaction-based services that are performed as
part of investment management services and are
based on a fixed price per unit or as a
percentage of the total transaction amount.
Brokerage fees also include distribution fees and
sales commissions that are primarily in the
Global Wealth & Investment Management (GWIM)
segment and are earned over time. In addition,
primarily in the Global Markets segment,
brokerage fees are earned when the Corporation
fills customer orders to buy or sell various
financial products or when it acknowledges,
affirms, settles and clears transactions and/or
submits trade information to the appropriate
clearing broker. Certain customers pay brokerage,
clearing and/or exchange fees imposed by relevant
regulatory bodies or exchanges in order to
execute or clear trades. These fees are recorded
net and are not reflected in the transaction
price, as the Corporation is an agent for those
services. Investment Banking Income Investment
banking income includes underwriting income and
financial advisory services income. Underwriting
consists of fees earned for the placement of a
customer’s debt or equity
securities. The revenue is generally earned based
on a percentage of the fixed number of shares or
principal placed. Once the number of shares or
notes is determined and the service is completed,
the underwriting fees are recognized. The
Corporation incurs certain out-of-pocket
expenses, such as legal costs, in performing
these services. These expenses are recovered
through the revenue the Corporation earns from
the customer and are included in operating
expenses. Syndication fees represent fees earned
as the agent or lead lender responsible for
structuring, arranging and administering a loan
syndication. Financial advisory services consist
of fees earned for assisting clients with
transactions related to mergers and acquisitions
and financial restructurings. Revenue varies
depending on the size of the transaction and
scope of services performed and is generally
contingent on successful completion of the
transaction. Revenue is typically recognized once
the transaction is completed and all services
have been rendered. Additionally, the Corporation
may earn a fixed fee in merger and acquisition
transactions to provide a fairness opinion, with
the fees recognized when the opinion is delivered
to the client. Other Revenue Measurement and
Recognition Policies The Corporation did not
disclose the value of any open performance
obligations at December 31, 2024, as its
contracts with customers generally have a fixed
term that is less than one year, an open term
with a cancellation period that is less than one
year, or provisions that allow the Corporation to
recognize revenue at the amount it has the right
to invoice. Earnings Per Common Share Earnings
per common share (EPS) is computed by dividing
net income allocated to common shareholders by
the weighted-average common shares outstanding,
excluding unvested common shares subject to
repurchase or cancellation. Net income allocated
to common shareholders is net income adjusted for
preferred stock dividends including dividends
declared, accretion of discounts on preferred
stock including accelerated accretion when
preferred stock is repaid early, and cumulative
dividends related to the current dividend period
that have not been declared as of period end,
less income allocated to participating
securities. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing
income allocated to common shareholders plus
dividends on dilutive convertible preferred stock
and preferred stock that can be tendered to
exercise warrants, by the weighted-average common
shares outstanding plus amounts representing the
dilutive effect of stock options outstanding,
restricted stock, restricted stock units (RSUs),
outstanding warrants and the dilution resulting
from the conversion of convertible preferred
stock, if applicable. Foreign Currency
Translation Assets, liabilities and operations of
foreign branches and subsidiaries are recorded
based on the functional currency of each entity.
When the functional currency of a foreign
operation is the local currency, the assets,
liabilities and operations are translated, for
consolidation purposes, from the local currency
to the U.S. dollar reporting currency at period-
end rates for assets and liabilities and
generally at average rates for results of
operations. The resulting unrealized gains and
losses are reported as a component of accumulated
OCI, net-of-tax. When the foreign entity’s
functional currency is the U.S. dollar, the
resulting remeasurement gains or losses on
foreign currency-denominated assets or
liabilities are included in earnings.

NOTE 3 Derivatives
Derivative Balances Derivatives are entered into on behalf of customers, for trading or to support
risk management activities. Derivatives used in risk management activities include derivatives that
may or may not be designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships. Derivatives that are not
designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships are referred to as other risk management
derivatives. For more information on the
Corporation’s derivatives and hedging activities, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting
Principles . The following tables present derivative instruments included on the Consolidated Balance
Sheet in derivative assets and liabilities at December 31, 2024 and 2023. Balances are presented on a
gross basis, prior to the application of counterparty and cash collateral netting. Total derivative
assets and liabilities are adjusted on an aggregate basis to take into consideration the effects of
legally enforceable master netting agreements and have been reduced by cash collateral received or
paid.

Offsetting of Derivatives The Corporation enters into International Swaps and Derivatives
Association, Inc. (ISDA) master netting agreements or similar agreements with substantially all of
the Corporation’s derivative counterparties. Where legally enforceable, these master netting
agreements give the Corporation, in the event of default by the counterparty, the right to liquidate
securities held as collateral and to offset receivables and payables with the same counterparty. For
purposes of the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Corporation offsets derivative assets and liabilities
and cash collateral held with the same counterparty where it has such a legally enforceable master
netting agreement. The following table presents derivative instruments included in derivative assets
and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2024 and 2023 by primary risk
(e.g., interest rate risk) and the platform, where applicable, on which these derivatives are
transacted. Balances are presented on a gross basis, prior to the application of counterparty and
cash collateral netting. Total gross derivative assets and liabilities are adjusted on an aggregate
basis to take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements, which
include reducing the balance for counterparty netting and cash collateral received or paid. For more
information on offsetting of securities financing agreements, see Note 10 – Securities Financing
Agreements, Short-term Borrowings, Collateral and Restricted Cash .

these agreements is uncertain under bankruptcy laws in some countries or industries.
(3) Amounts are limited to the derivative asset/liability balance and, accordingly, do not include
excess collateral received/pledged. Financial instruments collateral includes securities collateral
received or pledged and cash securities held and posted at third-party custodians that are not offset
on the Consolidated Balance Sheet but shown as a reduction to derive net derivative assets and
liabilities.
ALM and Risk Management Derivatives The Corporation’s ALM and risk management activities include the
use of derivatives to mitigate risk to the Corporation, including derivatives designated in
qualifying hedge accounting relationships and derivatives used in other risk management activities.
Interest rate, foreign exchange, equity, commodity and credit contracts are utilized in the
Corporation's ALM and risk management activities. The Corporation maintains an overall interest rate
risk management strategy that incorporates the use of interest rate contracts, which are generally
non-leveraged generic interest rate and basis swaps, options, futures and forwards, to minimize
significant fluctuations in earnings caused by interest rate volatility. The Corporation’s goal is to
manage interest rate sensitivity and volatility so that movements in interest rates do not
significantly adversely affect earnings or capital. As a result of interest rate fluctuations, hedged
fixed-rate assets and liabilities appreciate or depreciate in fair value. Gains or losses on the
derivative instruments that are linked to the hedged fixed-rate assets and liabilities are expected
to substantially offset this unrealized appreciation or depreciation. Market risk, including interest
rate risk, can be substantial in the mortgage business. Market risk in the mortgage business is the
risk that values of mortgage assets or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market
conditions such as interest rate movements. To mitigate the interest rate risk in mortgage banking
production income, the Corporation utilizes forward loan sale commitments and other derivative
instruments, including purchased options and certain debt securities. The Corporation also utilizes
derivatives such as interest rate options, interest rate swaps, forward settlement contracts and
eurodollar futures to hedge certain market risks of MSRs. The Corporation uses foreign exchange
contracts to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with certain foreign currency-denominated
assets and liabilities, as well as the Corporation’s investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries. Exposure
to loss on these contracts will increase or decrease over their respective lives as currency exchange
and interest rates fluctuate. The Corporation purchases credit derivatives to manage credit risk
related to certain funded and unfunded credit exposures. Credit derivatives include credit default
swaps (CDS), total return swaps and swaptions. These derivatives are recorded on the Consolidated
Balance Sheet at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in other income. Derivatives
Designated as Accounting Hedges The Corporation uses various types of interest rate and foreign
exchange derivative contracts to protect against changes in the fair value of its assets and
liabilities due to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates (fair value hedges). The
Corporation also uses these types of contracts to protect against changes in the cash flows of its
assets and liabilities, and other forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges). The Corporation hedges
its net investment in consolidated non-U.S.
 105Bank of America 
operations determined to have functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar using forward exchange
contracts and cross-currency basis swaps, and by issuing foreign currency- denominated debt (net
investment hedges). Fair Value Hedges The table below summarizes information related to fair value

expense, $ 463million, $( 51) million and $( 81) million in market making and similar activities, and
$ 15million, $ 15million and $( 2) million in accumulated OCI, respectively. Line item totals are in
the Consolidated Statement of Income and on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

The table below summarizes the carrying value of hedged assets and liabilities that are designated in
fair value hedging relationships, along with the cumulative amount of gains and losses on the hedged
assets and liabilities that are included in their carrying value. There is no impact to earnings for
the cumulative amount of these fair value hedging adjustments as long as the hedging relationships
remain open through the hedged period. Instead, the open hedges have the effect of synthetically
converting the hedged assets and liabilities into variable-rate instruments. If an open hedge is de-
designated prior to the derivative’s maturity, any cumulative fair value adjustments at the de-
designation date are then amortized or accreted into earnings over the remaining life of the hedged
assets or liabilities.

adjustments from de-designated AFS debt securities hedges decreased the AFS debt securities carrying

being amortized or accreted into interest over the contractual lives of the assets or liabilities.
Cash Flow and Net Investment Hedges The following table summarizes certain information related to
cash flow hedges and net investment hedges for 2024, 2023 and 2022. Of the $ 5.6billion after-tax net
loss ($ 7.5billion pretax) on derivatives in accumulated OCI at December 31, 2024, losses of $
2.5billion after-tax ($ 3.4billion pretax) related to both open and closed cash flow hedges are
expected to be reclassified into earnings in the next 12 months. These net losses reclassified into
earnings are expected to primarily decrease net interest income related to the respective hedged
items. For open cash flow hedges, the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are
hedged is approximately five years. For terminated cash flow hedges, the time period over which the
forecasted transactions will be recognized in interest income is approximately four years, with the
aggregated amount beyond this time period being insignificant. On November 15, 2023, Bloomberg Index
Services Limited announced the permanent cessation of the Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index
(BSBY) and all its tenors effective after final publication on November 15, 2024. The Corporation
determined that certain forecasted BSBY-indexed interest payments, which had been designated in cash
flow hedges, were no longer expected to occur beyond November 15, 2024 as they would transition to a
new reference rate. Accordingly, during the fourth quarter of 2023, the Corporation reclassified $
2.0billion of pretax loss from accumulated OCI into market making and similar activities for the
amount related to these forecasted transactions.

Corporation to reduce certain risk exposures by
economically hedging various assets and
liabilities. The table below presents gains
(losses) on these derivatives for 2024, 2023 and
2022. These gains (losses) are largely offset by
the income or expense recorded on the hedged

Transfers of Financial Assets with Risk Retained through Derivatives The Corporation enters into
certain transactions involving the transfer of financial assets that are accounted for as sales where
substantially all of the economic exposure to the transferred financial assets is retained through
derivatives (e.g., interest rate and/or credit), but the Corporation does not retain control over the
assets transferred. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Corporation had transferred $ 3.9billion and $
4.1billion of non-U.S. government-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities to a third-party trust and
retained economic exposure to the transferred assets through derivative contracts. In connection with
these transfers, the Corporation received gross cash proceeds of $ 3.9billion and $ 4.2billion at the
transfer dates. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the transferred securities was $
3.6billion and $ 4.1billion. Sales and Trading Revenue The Corporation enters into trading
derivatives to facilitate client transactions and to manage risk exposures arising from trading
account assets and liabilities. It is the Corporation’s policy to
include these derivative instruments in its trading activities, which include derivatives and non-
derivative cash instruments. The resulting risk from these derivatives is managed on a portfolio
basis as part of the Corporation’s Global Markets business segment. The related sales and trading
revenue generated within Global Markets is recorded in various income statement line items, including
market making and similar activities and net interest income as well as other revenue categories.
Sales and trading revenue includes changes in the fair value and realized gains and losses on the
sales of trading and other assets, net interest income, and fees primarily from commissions on equity
securities. Revenue is generated by the difference in the client price for an instrument and the
price at which the trading desk can execute the trade in the dealer market. For equity securities,
commissions related to purchases and sales are recorded in the “Other” column in the Sales and
Trading Revenue table. Changes in the fair value of these securities are included in market making
and similar activities. For debt securities, revenue, with the exception of interest associated with
the debt securities, is typically included in market making and similar activities. Unlike
commissions for equity securities, the initial revenue related to broker-dealer services for debt
securities is typically included in the pricing of the instrument rather than being charged through
separate fee arrangements. Therefore, this revenue is recorded in market making and similar
activities as part of the initial mark to fair value. For derivatives, the majority of revenue is
included in market making and similar activities. In transactions where the Corporation acts as
agent, which include exchange-traded futures and options, fees are recorded in other income. The
following table, which includes both derivatives and non-derivative cash instruments, identifies the
amounts in the respective income statement line items attributable to the Corporation’s sales and
trading revenue in Global Markets , categorized by primary risk, for 2024, 2023 and 2022. This table
includes debit valuation adjustment (DVA) and funding valuation adjustment (FVA) gains (losses).

Credit Derivatives The Corporation enters into credit derivatives primarily to facilitate client
transactions and to manage credit risk exposures. Credit derivatives derive value based on an
underlying third-party referenced obligation or a portfolio of referenced obligations and generally
require the Corporation, as the seller of credit protection, to make payments to a buyer upon the
occurrence of a predefined credit event. Such credit events generally include bankruptcy of the
referenced credit entity and failure to pay under the obligation, as well as acceleration of
indebtedness and payment repudiation or moratorium. For credit derivatives based on a portfolio of
referenced credits or credit indices, the Corporation may not be required to make payment until a
specified amount of loss has occurred and/or may only be required to make payment up to a specified
amount. Credit derivatives are classified as investment and non-investment grade based on the credit
quality of the underlying referenced obligation. The Corporation considers ratings of BBB- or higher
as investment grade. Non-investment grade includes non-rated credit derivative instruments. The
Corporation discloses internal categorizations of investment grade and non-investment grade
consistent with how risk is managed for these instruments. Credit derivative instruments where the
Corporation is the seller of credit protection and their expiration at December 31, 2024 and 2023 are
summarized in the following table.

 derivatives 
The notional amount represents the maximum amount payable by the Corporation for most credit
derivatives. However, the Corporation does not monitor its exposure to credit derivatives based
solely on the notional amount because this measure does not take into consideration the probability
of occurrence. As such, the notional amount is not a reliable indicator of the Corporation’s exposure
to these contracts. Instead, a risk framework is used to define risk tolerances and establish limits
so that certain credit risk-related losses occur within acceptable, predefined limits. Credit-related
notes in the table above include investments in securities issued by CDO, collateralized loan
obligation (CLO) and credit-linked note vehicles. These instruments are primarily classified as
trading securities. The carrying value of these instruments equals the Corporation’s maximum exposure
to loss. The Corporation is not obligated to make any payments to the entities under the terms of the
securities owned. Credit-related Contingent Features and Collateral The Corporation executes the
majority of its derivative contracts in the OTC market with large, international financial
institutions, including broker-dealers and, to a lesser degree, with a variety of nonfinancial
companies. A significant majority of the derivative transactions are executed on a daily margin
basis. Therefore, events such as a credit rating downgrade (depending on the ultimate rating level)
or a breach of credit covenants would typically require an increase in the amount of collateral
 109Bank of America 
required of the counterparty, where applicable, and/or allow the Corporation to take additional
protective measures such as early termination of all trades. Further, as previously discussed on page
158, the Corporation enters into legally enforceable master netting agreements that reduce risk by
permitting closeout and netting of transactions with the same counterparty upon the occurrence of
certain events. Certain of the Corporation’s derivative contracts contain credit risk-related
contingent features, primarily in the form of ISDA master netting agreements and credit support
documentation that enhance the creditworthiness of these instruments compared to other obligations of
the respective counterparty with whom the Corporation has transacted. These contingent features may
be for the benefit of the Corporation as well as its counterparties with respect to changes in the
Corporation’s creditworthiness and the mark-to-market exposure under the derivative transactions. At
December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Corporation held cash and securities collateral of $ 105.9billion and
$ 104.1billion and posted cash and securities collateral of $ 83.1billion and $ 93.4billion in the
normal course of business under derivative agreements, excluding cross-product margining agreements
where clients are permitted to margin on a net basis for both derivative and secured financing
arrangements. In connection with certain OTC derivative contracts and other trading agreements, the
Corporation can be required to provide additional collateral or to terminate transactions with
certain counterparties in the event of a downgrade of the senior debt ratings of the Corporation or
certain subsidiaries. The amount of additional collateral required depends on the contract and is
usually a fixed incremental amount and/or the market value of the exposure. At December 31, 2024, the
amount of collateral, calculated based on the terms of the contracts, that the Corporation and
certain subsidiaries could be required to post to counterparties but had not yet posted to
counterparties was $ 2.7billion, including $ 1.4billion for Bank of America, National Association
(BANA). Some counterparties are currently able to unilaterally terminate certain contracts, or the
Corporation or certain subsidiaries may be required to take other action such as find a suitable
replacement or obtain a guarantee. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the liability recorded for these
derivative contracts was not significant. The following table presents the amount of additional
collateral that would have been contractually required by derivative contracts and other trading
agreements at December 31, 2024 if the rating agencies had downgraded their long-term senior debt
ratings for the Corporation or certain subsidiaries by one incremental notch and by an additional
second incremental notch. The table also presents derivative liabilities that would be subject to
unilateral termination by counterparties upon downgrade of the Corporation's or certain subsidiaries’
long-term senior debt ratings.

Valuation Adjustments on Derivatives The
Corporation records credit risk valuation
adjustments on derivatives in order to properly
reflect the credit quality of the counterparties
and its own credit quality. The Corporation
calculates valuation adjustments on derivatives
based on a modeled expected exposure that
incorporates current market risk factors. The
exposure also takes into consideration credit
mitigants such as enforceable master netting
agreements and collateral. CDS spread data is
used to estimate the default probabilities and
severities that are applied to the exposures.
Where no observable credit default data is
available for counterparties, the Corporation
uses proxies and other market data to estimate
default probabilities and severity.
The table below presents credit valuation
adjustment (CVA), DVA and FVA gains (losses) on
derivatives (excluding the effect of any related
hedge activities), which are recorded in market
making and similar activities, for 2024, 2023 and
2022. CVA gains reduce the cumulative CVA thereby
increasing the derivative assets balance. DVA
gains increase the cumulative DVA thereby
decreasing the derivative liabilities balance.
CVA and DVA losses have the opposite impact. FVA
gains related to derivative assets reduce the
cumulative FVA thereby increasing the derivative
assets balance. FVA gains related to derivative
liabilities increase the cumulative FVA thereby
decreasing the derivative liabilities balance.
FVA losses have the opposite impact.

(1) At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the underlying collateral type included approximately 25percent
and 17percent prime and 75percent and 83percent subprime.
(2) Primarily includes non-U.S. securities used to satisfy certain international regulatory
requirements. Any changes in value are reported in market making and similar activities. For detail
on the components, see Note 20 – Fair Value Measurements .
(3) Includes securities pledged as collateral of $ 184.6billion and $ 204.9billion at December 31,
2024 and 2023.
(4) The Corporation held debt securities from FNMA and FHLMC that each exceeded 10percent of
shareholders’ equity, with an amortized cost of $ 260.9billion and $ 169.0billion, and a fair value
of $ 209.6billion and $ 136.5billion at December 31, 2024, and an amortized cost of $ 272.5billion
and $ 171.5billion, and a fair value of $ 226.4billion and $ 142.3billion at December 31, 2023.
At December 31, 2024, the accumulated net
unrealized loss on AFS debt securities, excluding
the amount related to debt securities previously
transferred to held to maturity, included in
accumulated OCI was $ 2.6billion, net of the
related income tax benefit of $ 872million. At
December 31, 2024 and 2023, nonperforming AFS
debt securities held by the Corporation were not
significant. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, $
871.1billion and $ 824.9billion of AFS and HTM
debt securities, which were predominantly U.S.
agency and U.S. Treasury securities, have a zero
credit loss assumption. For the same periods, the
ECL on the remaining $ 37.5billion and $
40.2billion of AFS and HTM debt securities were
insignificant. For more information on the zero
credit loss assumption, see Note 1 – Summary of
Significant Accounting Principles . At December
31, 2024 and 2023, the Corporation held equity
securities at an aggregate fair value of $
247million and $ 251million and other equity
securities, as valued under the measurement
alternative, at a carrying value of $ 438million
and $ 377million, both of which are included in
other assets. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the
Corporation also held money market investments at
a fair value of $ 1.3billion and $ 1.2billion,
which are included in time deposits placed and

The Corporation has entered into long-term credit protection agreements with FNMA and FHLMC on loans
totaling $ 8.0billion and $ 8.7billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, providing full credit
protection on residential mortgage loans that become severely delinquent. All of these loans are
individually insured, and therefore the Corporation does not record an allowance for credit losses
related to these loans. Nonperforming Loans and Leases Nonperforming loans were $ 6.0billion and $
5.5billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023. Commercial nonperforming loans were $ 3.3billion and $

Consumer nonperforming loans were $ 2.6billion and $ 2.7billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023,
primarily comprised of residential mortgage. The following table presents the Corporation’s
nonperforming loans and leases and loans accruing past due 90 days or more at December 31, 2024 and
2023. Nonperforming LHFS are excluded from nonperforming loans and leases as they are recorded at
either fair value or the lower of cost or fair value. For more information on the criteria for
classification as nonperforming, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles.

(1) Residential mortgage loans accruing past due 90 days or more are fully-insured loans. At December
31, 2024 and 2023 residential mortgage included $ 119million and $ 156million of loans on which
interest had been curtailed by the FHA, and therefore were no longer accruing interest, although
principal was still insured, and $ 110million and $ 96million of loans on which interest was still
accruing.
(2) Primarily relates to loans for which the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral less
any costs to sell is greater than the amortized cost of the loans as of the reporting date.

Credit Quality Indicators The Corporation monitors credit quality within its Consumer Real Estate,
Credit Card and Other Consumer, and Commercial portfolio segments based on primary credit quality
indicators. For more information on the portfolio segments, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant
Accounting Principles. Within the Consumer Real Estate portfolio segment, the primary credit quality
indicators are refreshed LTV and refreshed Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) score. Refreshed LTV
measures the carrying value of the loan as a percentage of the value of the property securing the
loan, refreshed quarterly. Home equity loans are evaluated using CLTV, which measures the carrying
value of the Corporation’s loan and available line of credit combined with any outstanding senior
liens against the property as a percentage of the value of the property securing the loan, refreshed
quarterly. FICO score measures the creditworthiness of the borrower based on the financial
obligations of the borrower and the borrower’s credit history. FICO scores are typically refreshed
quarterly or more frequently. Certain borrowers (e.g., borrowers that have had debts discharged in a
bankruptcy proceeding) may not have their FICO scores updated. FICO scores are also a primary credit
quality indicator for the Credit Card and Other Consumer portfolio segment and the business card
portfolio within U.S. small business commercial. Within the Commercial portfolio segment, loans are
evaluated using the internal classifications of pass rated or reservable criticized as the primary
credit quality indicators. The term reservable criticized refers to those commercial loans that are
internally classified or listed by the Corporation as Special Mention, Substandard or Doubtful, which
are asset quality categories defined by regulatory authorities. These assets have an elevated level
of risk and may have a high probability of default or total loss. Pass rated refers to all loans not
considered reservable criticized. In addition to these primary credit quality indicators, the
Corporation uses other credit quality indicators for certain types of loans. The following tables
present certain credit quality indicators and gross charge-offs for the Corporation's Consumer Real
Estate, Credit Card and Other Consumer, and Commercial portfolio segments by year of origination,
except for revolving loans and revolving loans that were modified into term loans, which are shown on
an aggregate basis at December 31, 2024.

Loan Modifications to Borrowers in Financial Difficulty As part of its credit risk management, the
Corporation may modify a loan agreement with a borrower experiencing financial difficulties through a
refinancing or restructuring of the borrower’s loan agreement (modification programs). Consumer Real
Estate The following modification programs are offered for consumer real estate loans to borrowers
experiencing financial difficulties, in addition to borrowers affected by natural disasters.
Forbearance and Other Payment Plans: Forbearance plans generally consist of the Corporation
suspending the borrower’s payments for a defined period, with those payments then due over a defined
period of time or at the conclusion of the forbearance period. The aging status of a loan is
generally frozen when it enters into a forbearance plan. If a borrower is unable to fulfill their
obligations under the forbearance plans, they may be offered a trial offer or permanent modification.
Trial Offer and Permanent Modifications : Trial offer for modification plans generally consist of the
Corporation offering a borrower modified loan terms that reduce their contractual payments
temporarily over a three-to- four-monthtrial period. If the customer successfully makes the modified
payments during the trial period and formally accepts the modified terms, the modified loan terms
become permanent. Some borrowers may enter into permanent modifications without a trial period. In a
permanent modification, the borrower’s payment terms are typically modified in more than one manner,
but generally include a term extension and an interest rate reduction. At times, the permanent
modification may also include principal forgiveness and/or a deferral of past due principal and
interest amounts to the end of the loan term. The combinations utilized are based on modifying the
terms that give the borrower an improved ability to meet the contractual obligations. The term
extensions granted for residential mortgage and home equity permanent modifications vary widely and
can be up to 30years, but most are in the range of 1to 20years. Principal forgiveness and payment
deferrals were insignificant during 2024 and 2023. The table below provides the ending amortized cost
of the Corporation’s modified consumer real estate loans at December 31, 2024 and 2023.

The Corporation tracks the performance of modified loans to assess effectiveness of modification
programs. During 2024 and 2023, defaults of residential and home equity loans that had been modified
within 12 months were $ 128million and $ 287million. The table below provides aging information as of
December 31, 2024 and 2023 for consumer real estate loans that were modified over the last 12 months.

Consumer real estate foreclosed properties totaled $ 60million and $ 83million at December 31, 2024
and 2023. The carrying value of consumer real estate loans, including fully-insured loans, for which
formal foreclosure proceedings were in process at December 31, 2024 and 2023, was $ 464million and $
633million. During 2024 and 2023, the Corporation reclassified $ 89million and $ 106million of
consumer real estate loans to foreclosed properties or, for properties acquired upon foreclosure of
certain government-guaranteed loans (principally FHA-insured loans), to other assets. The
reclassifications represent non-cash investing activities and, accordingly, are not reflected in the
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Credit Card and Other Consumer Credit card and other consumer
loans are primarily modified by placing the customer on a fixed payment plan with a significantly
reduced fixed interest rate, with terms ranging from 6months to 72months, most of which had a
60-monthterm at December 31, 2024. In certain circumstances, the Corporation will forgive a portion
of the outstanding balance if the borrower makes payments up to a set amount. The Corporation makes
modifications directly with borrowers for loans held by the Corporation (internal programs) as well
as through third-party renegotiation agencies that provide solutions to customers’ entire unsecured
debt structures (external programs). The December 31, 2024 amortized cost of credit card and other
consumer loans that were modified through these programs during 2024 was $ 650million compared to $
598million in 2023. These modifications represented 0.31percent of outstanding credit card and other
consumer loans for 2024 compared to 0.29percent for 2023. During 2024, the financial effect of
modifications resulted in a weighted-average interest rate reduction of 18.89percent compared to
19.02percent in 2023, and principal forgiveness of $ 113million compared to $ 61million in 2023. The
Corporation tracks the performance of modified loans to assess effectiveness of modification
programs. During 2024 and 2023, defaults of credit card and other consumer loans that had been
modified within 12 months were insignificant. At December 31, 2024, modified credit card and other
consumer loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty over the last 12 months totaled $
650million, of which $ 546million were current, $ 58million were 30-89 days past due, and $ 46million
were greater than 90 days past due. At December 31, 2023, modified credit card and other consumer
loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty totaled $ 598million, of which $ 491million were
current, $ 59million were 30-89 days past due, and $ 48million were greater than 90 days past due.
Commercial Loans Modifications of loans to commercial borrowers experiencing financial difficulty are
designed to reduce the Corporation’s loss exposure while providing borrowers with an opportunity to
work through financial difficulties, often to avoid foreclosure or bankruptcy. Each modification is
unique, reflects the borrower’s individual circumstances and is designed to benefit the borrower
while mitigating the Corporation’s risk exposure. Commercial modifications are primarily term
extensions and payment forbearances. Payment forbearances involve the Corporation forbearing its
contractual right to collect certain payments or payment in full (maturity forbearance) for a defined
period of time. Reductions in interest rates and principal forgiveness occur infrequently for
commercial borrowers. Principal forgiveness may occur in connection with foreclosure, short sales or
other settlement agreements, leading to termination or sale of the loan. The following table provides
the ending amortized cost of commercial loans modified during 2024 and 2023.

Term extensions granted increased the weighted-average life of the impacted loans by 1.7years during
2024 compared to 1.6years in 2023. The weighted-average duration of loan payments deferred under the
Corporation’s commercial loan forbearance program was 9months during 2024 and 2023. The deferral
period for loan payments can vary, but are mostly in the range of 8months to 24months. Modifications
of loans to troubled borrowers for Commercial Lease Financing and U.S. Small Business Commercial were
not significant during 2024. The Corporation tracks the performance of modified loans to assess
effectiveness of modification programs. In 2024 and 2023, defaults of commercial loans that had been
modified within 12 months were $ 102million and $ 159million. The table below provides aging

For 2024 and 2023, the Corporation had commitments to lend $ 1.3billion and $ 1.2billion to
commercial borrowers experiencing financial difficulty whose loans were modified during the period.
Prior-period Troubled Debt Restructuring Disclosures Prior to adopting the new accounting standard on
loan modifications, the Corporation accounted for modifications of loans to borrowers experiencing
financial difficulty as TDRs, when the modification resulted in a concession. The following
discussion reflects loans that were considered TDRs prior to January 1, 2023. Consumer Real Estate
The following table presents the December 31, 2022 unpaid principal balance, carrying value, and
average pre- and post-modification interest rates of consumer real estate loans that were modified in
TDRs during 2022. The following Consumer Real Estate portfolio segment tables include loans that were
initially classified as TDRs during the period and also loans that had previously been classified as
TDRs and were modified again during the period. Binding trial modifications are classified as TDRs
when the trial offer is made and continue to be classified as TDRs regardless of whether the borrower
enters into a permanent modification. At December 31, 2022, remaining commitments to lend additional
funds to debtors whose terms have been modified in a consumer real estate TDR were not significant.

Credit card and other consumer loans are deemed to be in payment default during the quarter in which
a borrower misses the second of twoconsecutive payments. Payment defaults are one of the factors
considered when projecting future cash flows in the calculation of the allowance for loan and lease
losses for credit card and other consumer. Commercial Loans During 2022 , the carrying value of the
Corporation’s commercial loans that were modified as TDRs was $ 1.9billion . At December 31, 2022 ,
the Corporation had commitments to lend $ 358million to commercial borrowers whose loans were
classified as TDRs. The balance of commercial TDRs in payment default was $ 105million at December
31, 2022 .
Loans Held-for-sale The Corporation had LHFS of $ 9.5billion and $ 6.0billion at December 31, 2024
and 2023. Cash and non-cash proceeds from sales and paydowns of loans originally classified as LHFS
were $ 32.3billion, $ 16.3billion and $ 32.0billion for 2024, 2023 and 2022. Cash used for
originations and purchases of LHFS totaled $ 36.2billion, $ 15.6billion and $ 24.9billion for 2024,
2023 and 2022 . Also included were non-cash net transfers into LHFS of $ 0, $ 632million and $
1.9billion during 2024, 2023 and 2022 . Accrued Interest Receivable Accrued interest receivable for
loans and leases and loans held-for-sale was $ 4.3billion and $ 4.5billion at December 31, 2024 and
2023 and is reported in customer and other receivableson the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Outstanding
credit card loan balances include unpaid principal, interest and fees. Credit card loans are not
classified as nonperforming but are charged off no later than the end of the month in which the
account becomes 180 days past due, within 60 days after receipt of notification of death or
bankruptcy, or upon confirmation of fraud . During 2024, the Corporation reversed $ 856million of
interest and fee income against the income statement line item in which it was originally recorded
upon charge-off of the principal balance of the loan compared to $ 584million in 2023. For the
outstanding residential mortgage, home equity, direct/indirect consumer and commercial loan balances
classified as nonperforming during 2024 and 2023, interest and fee income reversed at the time the
loans were classified as nonperforming was not significant. For more information on the Corporation's
nonperforming loan policies, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles.
Allowance for Credit Losses The allowance for credit losses is estimated using quantitative and
qualitative methods that consider a variety of factors, such as historical loss experience, the
current credit quality of the portfolio and an economic outlook over the life of the loan.
Qualitative reserves cover losses that are expected but, in the Corporation's assessment, may not
adequately be reflected in the quantitative methods or the economic assumptions. The Corporation
incorporates forward-looking information through the use of several macroeconomic scenarios in
determining the
weighted economic outlook over the forecasted life of the assets. These scenarios include key
macroeconomic variables such as gross domestic product, unemployment rate, real estate prices and
corporate bond spreads. The scenarios that are chosen each quarter and the weighting given to each
scenario depend on a variety of factors including recent economic events, leading economic
indicators, internal and third-party economist views, and industry trends. For more information on
the Corporation's credit loss accounting policies including the allowance for credit losses, see Note
1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles . The December 31, 2024 estimate for allowance for
credit losses was based on various economic scenarios, including a baseline scenario derived from
consensus estimates, an adverse scenario reflecting an extended moderate recession, a downside
scenario reflecting continued inflation and interest rates with minimal rate cuts, a tail risk
scenario similar to the severely adverse scenario used in stress testing and an upside scenario that
considers the potential for improvement above the baseline scenario. The overall weighted economic
outlook of the above scenarios has improved compared to the weighted economic outlook estimated as of
December 31, 2023. The weighted economic outlook assumes that the U.S. average unemployment rate will
be just below fivepercent in the fourth quarter of 2025 and will remain near this level through the
fourth quarter of 2026. The weighted economic outlook assumes steady growth with U.S. real gross
domestic product forecasted to grow at 1.4percent and 1.8percent year-over-year in the fourth
quarters of 2025 and 2026. The allowance for credit losses decreased $ 215million from December 31,
2023 to $ 14.3billion at December 31, 2024. The change in the allowance for credit losses was
comprised of a net decrease of $ 102million in the allowance for loan and lease losses and a decrease
of $ 113million in the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. The decline in the allowance for
credit losses was attributed to decreases in the commercial portfolio of $ 240million and the
consumer real estate portfolio of $ 118million, partially offset by an increase in the credit card
and other consumer portfolios of $ 143million. The provision for credit losses increased $ 1.4billion
to $ 5.8billion in 2024 compared to $ 4.4billion in 2023 and $ 2.5billion in 2022. The increase in
provision for credit losses in 2024 was primarily driven by credit card as well as small business
loan growth, and asset quality deterioration in the commercial real estate office and credit card
portfolios. The increase in provision for credit losses in 2023 was driven by the Corporation’s
consumer portfolio primarily due to credit card loan growth and asset quality deterioration,
partially offset by improved macroeconomic conditions that primarily benefited the Corporation’s
commercial portfolio. Outstanding loans and leases excluding loans accounted for under the fair value
option increased $ 41.4billion in 2024 primarily driven by commercial, which increased $ 36.4billion
due to broad-based growth. The changes in the allowance for credit losses, including net charge-offs
and provision for loan and lease losses, are detailed in the following table.

NOTE 6 Securitizations and Other Variable Interest Entities
The Corporation utilizes VIEs in the ordinary course of business to support its own and its
customers’ financing and investing needs. The Corporation routinely securitizes loans and debt
securities using VIEs as a source of funding for the Corporation and as a means of transferring the
economic risk of the loans or debt securities to third parties. The assets are transferred into a
trust or other securitization vehicle such that the assets are legally isolated from the creditors of
the Corporation and are not available to satisfy its obligations. These assets can only be used to
settle obligations of the trust or other securitization vehicle. The Corporation also administers,
structures or invests in other VIEs including CDOs, investment vehicles and other entities. For more
information on the Corporation’s use of VIEs, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting
Principles. The tables in this Note present the assets and liabilities of consolidated and
unconsolidated VIEs at December 31, 2024 and 2023 in situations where the Corporation has a loan or
security interest and involvement with transferred assets or if the Corporation otherwise has an
additional interest in the VIE. The tables also present the Corporation’s maximum loss exposure at
December 31, 2024 and 2023 resulting from its
involvement with consolidated VIEs and unconsolidated VIEs. The Corporation’s maximum loss exposure
is based on the unlikely event that all of the assets in the VIEs become worthless and incorporates
not only potential losses associated with assets recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet but also
potential losses associated with off-balance sheet commitments, such as unfunded liquidity
commitments and other contractual arrangements. The Corporation’s maximum loss exposure does not
include losses previously recognized through write-downs of assets. The Corporation invests in ABS,
CLOs and other similar investments issued by third-party VIEs with which it has no other form of
involvement other than a loan or debt security issued by the VIE. In addition, the Corporation also
enters into certain commercial lending arrangements that may utilize VIEs for activities secondary to
the lending arrangement, for example to hold collateral. The Corporation’s maximum loss exposure to
these VIEs is the investment balances. These securities and loans are included in Note 4 – Securities
or Note 5 – Outstanding Loans and Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses and are not included in the
following tables. The Corporation did not provide financial support to consolidated or unconsolidated
VIEs during 2024, 2023 and
 Bank of America126 
2022 that it was not previously contractually required to provide, nor does it intend to do so. The
Corporation had liquidity commitments, including written put options and collateral value guarantees,
with certain unconsolidated VIEs of $ 1.0billion and $ 989million at December 31, 2024 and 2023.
First-lien Mortgage Securitizations As part of its mortgage banking activities, the Corporation
securitizes a portion of the first-lien residential mortgage loans it originates or purchases from
third parties, generally in the form of residential mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by
government-sponsored enterprises, FNMA and FHLMC (collectively the GSEs), or the Government National
Mortgage Association (GNMA) primarily in the case of FHA-insured and U.S. Department of Veterans
Affairs (VA)-guaranteed mortgage loans. Securitization usually occurs in conjunction with or shortly
after origination or purchase, and the Corporation may also securitize loans held in its residential
mortgage portfolio. In addition, the Corporation may, from time to time, securitize commercial
mortgages it originates or purchases from other entities. The Corporation typically services the
loans it securitizes. Further, the Corporation may retain beneficial interests in the securitization
trusts including senior and subordinate securities and equity tranches issued by the trusts. Except
as described in Note 12 – Commitments and Contingencies , the Corporation does not provide guarantees
or recourse to the securitization trusts other than standard representations and warranties. The
table below summarizes select information related to first-lien mortgage securitizations for 2024,
2023 and 2022.

(1) The Corporation transfers residential mortgage loans to securitizations sponsored primarily by
the GSEs or GNMA in the normal course of business and primarily receives residential mortgage-backed
securities in exchange. Substantially all of these securities are classified as Level 2 within the
fair value hierarchy and are typically sold shortly after receipt.
(2) A majority of the first-lien residential mortgage loans securitized are initially classified as
LHFS and accounted for under the fair value option. Gains recognized on these LHFS prior to
securitization, which totaled $ 33million, $ 49million and $ 41million, net of hedges, during 2024,
2023 and 2022, respectively, are not included in the table above.
(3) The Corporation may have the option to repurchase delinquent loans out of securitization trusts,
which reduces the amount of servicing advances it is required to make. The Corporation may also
repurchase loans from securitization trusts to perform modifications. Repurchased loans include FHA-
insured mortgages collateralizing GNMA securities.
The Corporation recognizes consumer MSRs from the sale or securitization of consumer real estate
loans. The unpaid principal balance of loans serviced for investors, including residential mortgage
and home equity loans, totaled $ 84.1billion and $ 92.7billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023.
Servicing fee and ancillary fee income on serviced loans was $ 231million, $ 248million and $
274million during 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Servicing advances on serviced loans, including
loans serviced for others and loans held for investment, were $ 1.0billion and $ 1.3billion at
December 31, 2024 and 2023. For more information on MSRs, see Note 20 – Fair Value Measurements .
Home Equity Loans The Corporation retains interests, primarily senior securities, in home equity
securitization trusts to which it transferred home equity loans. In addition, the Corporation may be
obligated to provide subordinate funding to the trusts during a rapid amortization event. This
obligation is included in the maximum loss exposure in the preceding table. The charges that will
ultimately be recorded as a result of the rapid amortization events depend on the undrawn portion of
the home equity lines of credit, performance of the loans, the amount of subsequent draws and the
timing of related cash flows. Mortgage and Home Equity Securitizations During 2024, 2023 and 2022,
the Corporation deconsolidated agency residential mortgage securitization trusts with total assets of
$ 1.1billion, $ 685million and $ 784million. The following table summarizes select information
related to mortgage and home equity securitization trusts in which the Corporation held a variable
interest and had continuing involvement at December 31, 2024 and 2023.

(1) For unconsolidated home equity loan VIEs, the maximum loss exposure includes outstanding trust
certificates issued by trusts in rapid amortization, net of recorded reserves. For both consolidated
and unconsolidated home equity loan VIEs, the maximum loss exposure excludes the reserve for
representations and warranties obligations and corporate guarantees. For more information, see Note
12 – Commitments and Contingencies .
(2) Maximum loss exposure includes obligations under loss-sharing reinsurance and other arrangements
for non-agency residential mortgage and commercial mortgage securitizations, but excludes the reserve
for representations and warranties obligations and corporate guarantees and also excludes servicing
advances and other servicing rights and obligations. For more information, see Note 12 – Commitments
and Contingencies and Note 20 – Fair Value Measurements .
(3) Principal balance outstanding includes loans where the Corporation was the transferor to
securitization VIEs with which it has continuing involvement, which may include servicing the loans.
Other Asset-backed Securitizations The following paragraphs summarize select information related to
other asset-backed VIEs in which the Corporation had a variable interest at December 31, 2024 and
2023. Credit Card and Automobile Loan Securitizations The Corporation securitizes originated and
purchased credit card and automobile loans as a source of financing. The loans are sold on a non-
recourse basis to consolidated trusts. The securitizations are ongoing, whereas additional
receivables will be funded into the trusts by either loan repayments or proceeds from securities
issued to third parties, depending on the securitization structure. The Corporation’s continuing
involvement with the securitization trusts includes servicing the receivables and holding various
subordinated interests, including an undivided seller’s interest in the credit card receivables and
owning certain retained interests. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the carrying values of the
receivables in the trusts totaled $ 18.1billion and $ 16.6billion, which are included in loans and
leases, and the carrying values of senior debt securities that were issued to third-party investors
from the trusts totaled $ 8.0billion and $ 7.8billion, which are included in long-term debt.
Resecuritization Trusts The Corporation transfers securities, typically MBS, into resecuritization
VIEs generally at the request of customers seeking securities with specific characteristics.
Generally, there are no significant ongoing activities performed in a resecuritization trust, and no
single investor has the unilateral ability to liquidate the trust. The Corporation resecuritized $
23.9billion, $ 8.6billion, and $ 21.8billion of securities during 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Securities transferred into resecuritization VIEs were measured at fair value with changes in fair
value recorded in market making and similar activities prior to the resecuritization and,
accordingly, no gain or loss on sale was recorded. Securities received from the resecuritization VIEs
were recognized at their fair value of $ 3.6billion, $ 2.4billion and $ 2.4billion during 2024, 2023
and 2022, respectively. In 2024, 2023 and 2022, substantially all of the securities were classified
as trading account assets. Substantially all of the trading account securities carried at fair value
were categorized as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. Customer VIEs Customer VIEs include
credit-linked, equity-linked and commodity-linked note VIEs, repackaging VIEs and asset acquisition
VIEs, which are typically created on behalf of customers who wish to obtain market or credit exposure
to a specific company, index, commodity or financial instrument. The Corporation’s involvement in the
VIE is limited to its loss exposure. The Corporation’s maximum loss exposure to consolidated and
unconsolidated customer VIEs totaled $ 1.1billion and $ 952million at December 31, 2024 and 2023,
including the notional amount of derivatives to which the Corporation is a counterparty, net of
losses previously recorded, and the Corporation’s investment, if any, in securities issued by the
VIEs. Municipal Bond Trusts The Corporation administers municipal bond trusts that hold highly-rated,
long-term, fixed-rate municipal bonds. The trusts obtain financing by issuing floating-rate trust
certificates that reprice on a weekly or other short-term basis to third-party investors. The
Corporation’s liquidity commitments to unconsolidated municipal bond trusts, including those for
which the Corporation was transferor, totaled $ 1.8billion and $ 1.7billion at December 31, 2024 and
2023. The weighted-average remaining
 Bank of America128 
life of bonds held in the trusts at December 31, 2024 was 11.1years. There were no significant write-
downs or downgrades of assets or issuers during 2024, 2023 and 2022. Collateralized Debt Obligation
VIEs The Corporation receives fees for structuring CDO VIEs, which hold diversified pools of fixed-
income securities, typically corporate debt or ABS, which the CDO VIEs fund by issuing multiple
tranches of debt and equity securities. CDOs are generally managed by third-party portfolio managers.
The Corporation typically transfers assets to these CDOs, holds securities issued by the CDOs and may
be a derivative counterparty to the CDOs. The Corporation’s maximum loss exposure to consolidated and
unconsolidated CDOs totaled $ 65million and $ 80million at December 31, 2024 and 2023. Investment
VIEs The Corporation sponsors, invests in or provides financing, which may be in connection with the
sale of assets, to a variety of investment VIEs that hold loans, real estate, debt securities or
other financial instruments and are designed to provide the desired investment profile to investors
or the Corporation. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Corporation’s consolidated investment VIEs had
total assets of $ 6million and $ 472 million. The Corporation also held investments in unconsolidated
VIEs with total assets of $ 23.0billion and $ 18.4billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023. The
Corporation’s maximum loss exposure associated with both consolidated and unconsolidated investment
VIEs totaled $ 2.5billion and $ 2.6billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023 comprised primarily of on-
balance sheet assets less non-recourse liabilities. Leveraged Lease Trusts The Corporation’s net
investment in consolidated leveraged lease trusts totaled $ 1.0billion and $ 1.1billion at December
31, 2024 and 2023. The trusts hold long-lived equipment such as rail cars, power generation and
distribution equipment, and commercial aircraft. The Corporation structures the trusts and holds a
significant residual interest. The net investment represents the Corporation’s maximum loss exposure
to the trusts in the unlikely event that the leveraged lease investments become worthless. Debt
issued by the leveraged lease trusts is non-recourse to the Corporation. The table below summarizes
the maximum loss exposure and assets held by the Corporation that related to other asset-backed VIEs
at December 31, 2024 and 2023.

(1) At December 31, 2024 and 2023 loans and leases in the consolidated credit card trust included $
4.5billion and $ 3.2billion of seller’s interest.
(2) The retained senior securities were valued using quoted market prices or observable market inputs
(Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy).
Tax Credit VIEs The Corporation holds equity investments in unconsolidated limited partnerships and
similar entities that construct, own and operate affordable housing, renewable energy and certain
other projects. The total assets of these unconsolidated tax credit VIEs were $ 85.7billion and $
84.1billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. An unrelated third party is typically the general
partner or managing member and has control over the significant activities of the VIE. As an
investor, tax credits associated with the investments in these entities are allocated to the
Corporation, as provided by the U.S. Internal Revenue Code and related regulations, and are
recognized as income tax benefits in the Corporation’s Consolidated Statement of Income in the year
they are earned, which varies based on the type of investments. Tax credits from investments in
affordable housing are recognized ratably over a term of up to 10 years, and tax credits from
renewable energy investments are recognized either at inception for transactions electing Investment
Tax Credits (ITCs) or as energy is produced for transactions electing Production Tax Credits (PTCs),
which is generally up to a 10-year
 129Bank of America 
time period. The volume and types of investments
held by the Corporation will influence the amount
of tax credits recognized each period.
The Corporation’s equity investments in
affordable housing and other projectstotaled $
16.7billion and $ 15.8billion at December 31,
2024 and 2023, which included unfunded capital
contributions of $ 7.5billion and $ 7.2billion
that are probable to be paid over the next five
years. The Corporation may be asked to invest
additional amounts to support a troubled
affordable housing project. Such additional
investments have not been and are not expected to
be significant. During 2024, 2023 and 2022, the
Corporation recognized tax credits and other tax
benefitsrelated to affordable housing equity
investments of $ 2.2billion, $ 1.9billion and $
1.5billion, and reported pretax losses in other
incomeof $ 1.6billion, $ 1.5billion and $
1.2billion. The Corporation’s equity investments
in renewable energy totaled $ 13.0billion and $
14.2billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023. In
addition, the Corporation had unfunded capital
contributions for renewable energy investments of
$ 4.6billion and $ 6.2billion at December 31,
2024 and 2023, which are contingent on various
conditions precedent to funding over the next two
years. The Corporation’s risk of loss is
generally mitigated by policies requiring the
project to qualify for the expected tax credits
prior to making its investment. During 2024, 2023
and 2022, the Corporation recognized tax credits
and other tax benefits related to renewable
energy equity investments of $ 3.9billion, $
4.0billion and $ 2.9billion and reported pretax
losses in other income of $ 3.0billion, $
3.1billion and $ 2.1billion. The Corporation may
also enter into power purchase agreements with
renewable energy tax credit entities.

During 2024, the Corporation completed its annual
goodwill impairment test as of June 30, 2024
using a qualitative assessment for all applicable
reporting units. Based on the assessment, the
Corporation has concluded that none of its
reporting units are at risk of impairment, as
each of the reporting units’ fair values are
substantially in excess of their carrying values.
For more information regarding the nature of and
accounting for the Corporation’s annual goodwill
impairment testing, see Note 1 – Summary of
Significant Accounting Principles . Intangible
Assets At both December 31, 2024 and 2023, the
net carrying value of intangible assets was $
2.0billion. At both December 31, 2024 and 2023,
intangible assets included $ 1.6billion of
intangible assets associated with trade names,
substantially all of which had an indefinite life
and, accordingly, are not being amortized.
Amortization of intangibles expense was $
78million for 2024, 2023 and 2022. NOTE 8 Leases
The Corporation enters into both lessor and
lessee arrangements. For more information on
lease accounting, see Note 1 – Summary of
Significant Accounting Principles and on lease
financing receivables, see Note 5 – Outstanding
Loans and Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses.
Lessor Arrangements
The Corporation’s lessor arrangements primarily
consist of operating, sales-type and direct
financing leases for equipment. Lease agreements
may include options to renew and for the lessee
to purchase the leased equipment at the end of
the lease term.
The table below presents the net investment in
sales-type and direct financing leases at
December 31, 2024 and 2023.

 financing leases 
(1) In certain cases, the Corporation obtains
third-party residual value insurance to reduce
its residual asset risk. The carrying value of
residual assets with third-party residual value
insurance for at least a portion of the asset
value was $ 8.0billion and $ 6.8billion at
December 31, 2024 and 2023.
The table below presents lease income for 2024,
2023 and 2022.

 Operating leases 931 945 941 
 Total lease income $ 2,013 $ 1,733 $ 1,530 
Lessee Arrangements
The Corporation's lessee arrangements
predominantly consist of operating leases for
premises and equipment; the Corporation's
financing leases are not significant.
Lease terms may contain renewal and extension
options and early termination features.
Generally, these options do not impact the lease
term because the Corporation is not reasonably
certain that it will exercise the options.

NOTE 10 Securities Financing Agreements, Short-term Borrowings, Collateral and Restricted Cash
The Corporation enters into securities financing agreements which include securities borrowed or
purchased under agreements to resell and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase.
These financing agreements (also referred to as “matched-book transactions”) are to accommodate
customers, obtain securities to cover short positions and finance inventory positions. The
Corporation elects to account for certain securities financing agreements under the fair value
option. For more information on the fair value option, see Note 21 – Fair Value Option . Offsetting
of Securities Financing Agreements Substantially all of the Corporation’s securities financing
activities are transacted under legally enforceable master repurchase agreements or legally
enforceable master securities lending agreements that give the Corporation, in the event of
default by the counterparty, the right to liquidate securities held and to offset receivables and
payables with the same counterparty. The Corporation offsets securities financing transactions with
the same counterparty on the Consolidated Balance Sheet where it has such a legally enforceable
master netting agreement and the transactions have the same maturity date. The Securities Financing
Agreements table presents securities financing agreements included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet
in federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell, and in federal
funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase at December 31, 2024 and
2023. Balances are presented on a gross basis, prior to the application of counterparty netting.
Gross assets and liabilities are adjusted on an aggregate basis to take into consideration the
effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements. For more information on the offsetting of
derivatives, see Note 3 – Derivatives.

(1) Includes activity where uncertainty exists as to the enforceability of certain master netting
agreements under bankruptcy laws in some countries or industries.
(2) Includes securities collateral received or pledged under repurchase or securities lending
agreements where there is a legally enforceable master netting agreement. These amounts are not
offset on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, but are shown as a reduction to derive a net asset or
liability. Securities collateral received or pledged where the legal enforceability of the master
netting agreements is uncertain is excluded from the table.
(3) Excludes repurchase activity of $ 12.3billion and $ 8.7billion reported in loans and leases on
the Consolidated Balance Sheet for December 31, 2024 and 2023.
(4) Balance is reported in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet
and relates to transactions where the Corporation acts as the lender in a securities lending
agreement and receives securities that can be pledged as collateral or sold. In these transactions,
the Corporation recognizes an asset at fair value, representing the securities received, and a
liability, representing the obligation to return those securities.
Repurchase Agreements and Securities Loaned Transactions Accounted for as Secured Borrowings The
following tables present securities sold under agreements to repurchase and securities loaned by
remaining contractual term to maturity and class of collateral pledged. Included in “Other” are
transactions where the Corporation acts as the lender in a securities lending agreement and receives
securities that can be pledged as collateral or sold. Certain agreements contain a right to
substitute collateral and/or terminate the agreement prior to maturity at the option of the
Corporation or the counterparty. Such agreements are included in the table below based on the
remaining contractual term to maturity.

Under repurchase agreements, the Corporation is required to post collateral with a market value equal
to or in excess of the principal amount borrowed. For securities loaned transactions, the Corporation
receives collateral in the form of cash, letters of credit or other securities. To determine whether
the market value of the underlying collateral remains sufficient, collateral is generally valued
daily, and the Corporation may be required to deposit additional collateral or may receive or return
collateral pledged when appropriate. Repurchase agreements and securities loaned transactions are
generally either overnight, continuous (i.e., no stated term) or short-term. The Corporation manages
liquidity risks related to these agreements by sourcing funding from a diverse group of
counterparties, providing a range of securities collateral and pursuing longer durations, when
appropriate. Short-term Borrowings The Corporation classifies borrowings with an original maturity of
less than one year as short-term borrowings on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. At December 31, 2024
and 2023, the majority of short-term borrowings consisted of Federal Home Loan Bank advances, which
totaled $ 12.7billion and $ 13.2billion, and commercial paper, which totaled $ 24.2billion and $
13.1billion. Collateral The Corporation accepts securities and loans as collateral that it is
permitted by contract or practice to sell or repledge. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the fair value
of this collateral was $ 925.7billion and $ 911.3billion, of which $ 882.2billion and $ 870.9billion
were sold or repledged. The primary source of this collateral is securities borrowed or purchased
under agreements to resell. The Corporation also pledges company-owned securities and loans as
collateral in transactions that include repurchase agreements, securities loaned, public and trust
deposits, U.S. Treasury tax and loan notes, and short-term borrowings. This collateral, which in some
cases can be sold or repledged by the counterparties to the transactions, is parenthetically
disclosed on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In certain cases, the Corporation has transferred assets
to consolidated VIEs where those restricted assets serve as collateral for the interests issued by
the VIEs. These assets are included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in Assets of Consolidated VIEs.
In addition, the Corporation obtains collateral in connection with its derivative contracts. Required
collateral levels vary depending on the credit risk rating and the type of counterparty. Generally,
the Corporation accepts collateral in the form of cash, U.S. Treasury securities and other marketable
securities. Based on provisions contained in master netting agreements, the Corporation nets cash
collateral received against derivative assets. The Corporation also pledges collateral on its own
derivative positions which can be applied against derivative liabilities. For more information on the
collateral of derivatives, see Note 3 – Derivatives. Restricted Cash At December 31, 2024 and 2023,
the Corporation held restricted cash included within cash and cash equivalents on the Consolidated
Balance Sheet of $ 6.1billion and $ 5.6billion, predominantly related to cash segregated in
compliance with securities regulations and cash held on deposit with central banks to meet reserve
requirements.

(1) Includes total loss-absorbing capacity compliant debt.
(2) Represents liabilities of consolidated VIEs included in total long-term debt on the Consolidated
Balance Sheet. Long-term debt of VIEs is collateralized by the assets of the VIEs. At December 31,
2024, amount includes debt predominantly from credit card and automobile securitizations of $
8.0billion and other VIEs of $ 458million. For more information, see Note 6 – Securitizations and
Other Variable Interest Entities.
(3) Includes debt outstanding of $ 11.7billion and $ 10.0billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023 that
was issued by BofA Finance LLC, a consolidated finance subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation, the
parent company, and is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the parent company.
During 2024, the Corporation issued $ 54.8billion of long-term debt consisting of $ 17.8billion of
notes issued by Bank of America Corporation, $ 15.6billion of notes issued by Bank of America, N.A.
and $ 21.4billion of other debt. During 2023, the Corporation issued $ 62.0billion of long-term debt
consisting of $ 24.0billion of notes issued by Bank of America Corporation, $ 25.1billion of notes
issued by Bank of America, N.A. and $ 12.9billion of other debt. During 2024, the Corporation had
total long-term debt maturities and redemptions in the aggregate of $ 66.6billion consisting of $
36.4billion for Bank of America Corporation, $ 16.8billion for Bank of America, N.A. and $
13.4billion of other debt. During 2023, the Corporation had total long-term debt maturities and
redemptions in the aggregate of $ 42.7billion consisting of $ 25.3billion for Bank of America
Corporation, $ 10.5billion for Bank of America, N.A. and $ 6.9billion of other debt. Bank of America
Corporation and Bank of America, N.A. maintain various U.S. and non-U.S. debt programs to offer both
senior and subordinated notes. The notes may be denominated in U.S. dollars or foreign currencies. At
December 31, 2024 and 2023, the amount of foreign currency-denominated debt translated into U.S.
dollars included in total long-term debt was $ 43.8billion and $ 49.8billion. Foreign currency
contracts may be used to convert certain foreign currency-denominated debt into U.S. dollars. The
weighted-average effective interest rates for total long-term debt (excluding senior structured
notes), total fixed-rate debt and total floating-rate debt were 3.80percent, 3.71percent and
4.45percent, respectively, at December 31, 2024, and 3.70percent, 3.55percent and 5.21percent,
respectively, at December 31, 2023. The Corporation’s ALM activities maintain an overall interest
rate risk management strategy that incorporates the use of interest rate contracts to manage
fluctuations in earnings caused by interest rate volatility. The Corporation’s goal is to manage
interest rate sensitivity so that movements in interest rates do not have a significantly adverse
effect on earnings and capital. The weighted-average rates are the contractual interest rates on the
debt and do not reflect the impacts of derivative transactions. The following table shows the
carrying value for aggregate annual contractual maturities of long-term debt as of December 31, 2024.
Included in the table are certain structured notes issued by the Corporation that contain provisions
whereby the borrowings are redeemable at the option of the holder (put options) at specified dates
prior to maturity. Other structured notes have coupon or repayment terms linked to the performance of
debt or equity securities, indices, currencies or
 Bank of America134 
commodities, and the maturity may be accelerated based on the value of a referenced index or
security. In both cases, the Corporation or a subsidiary may be required to settle the obligation for
cash or other securities prior to the contractual maturity date. These borrowings are reflected in
the table as maturing at their contractual maturity date.

NOTE 12 Commitments and Contingencies
In the normal course of business, the Corporation enters into a number of off-balance sheet
commitments. These commitments expose the Corporation to varying degrees of credit and market risk
and are subject to the same credit and market risk limitation reviews as those instruments recorded
on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Credit Extension Commitments The Corporation enters into
commitments to extend credit such as loan commitments, SBLCs and commercial letters of credit to meet
the financing needs of its customers. The following table includes the notional amount of unfunded
legally binding lending commitments net of amounts distributed (i.e., syndicated or participated) to
other financial institutions. The distributed amounts were $ 10.4billion and $ 10.3billion at
December 31, 2024 and 2023. The carrying value of the Corporation’s credit extension commitments at
December 31, 2024 and 2023, excluding commitments accounted for under
the fair value option, was $ 1.1billion and $ 1.2billion, which predominantly related to the reserve
for unfunded lending commitments. The carrying value of these commitments is classified in accrued
expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Legally binding commitments to
extend credit generally have specified rates and maturities. Certain of these commitments have
adverse change clauses that help to protect the Corporation against deterioration in the borrower’s
ability to pay. The following table includes the notional amount of commitments of $ 2.2billion and $
2.6billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023 that are accounted for under the fair value option. However,
the table excludes the cumulative net fair value for these commitments of $ 144million and $
67million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, which is classified in accrued expenses and other
liabilities. For more information regarding the Corporation’s loan commitments accounted for under
the fair value option, see Note 21 – Fair Value Option.

(1) At December 31, 2024 and 2023, $ 4.4billion and $ 3.1billion of these loan commitments were held
in the form of a security.
(2) The notional amounts of SBLCs and financial guarantees classified as investment grade and non-
investment grade based on the credit quality of the underlying reference name within the instrument
were $ 25.0billion and $ 10.1billion at December 31, 2024, and $ 23.6billion and $ 9.7billion at
December 31, 2023. Amounts in the table include consumer SBLCs of $ 1.0billion and $ 744million at
December 31, 2024 and 2023.
(3) Primarily includes second-loss positions on lease-end residual value guarantees.
(4) Includes business card unused lines of credit.
Other Commitments At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Corporation had commitments to purchase loans
(e.g., residential mortgage and commercial real estate) of $ 242million and $ 822million, which upon
settlement will be included in trading account assets, loans or LHFS, and commitments to purchase
commercial loans of $ 768million and $ 420million, which upon settlement will be included in trading
account assets. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Corporation had commitments to enter into resale
and forward-dated resale and securities borrowing agreements of $ 109.8billion and $ 117.0billion,
and commitments to enter into forward-dated repurchase and securities lending agreements of $
87.1billion and $ 63.0billion. A significant portion of these commitments will expire within the next
12months. At both December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Corporation had a commitment to originate or
purchase up to $ 4.0billion, on a rolling 12-month basis, of auto loans and leases from a strategic
partner. This commitment extends through November 2026 and can be terminated with 12months prior
notice. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Corporation had unfunded equity investment commitments of
$ 787million and $ 477million. As a Federal Reserve member bank, the Corporation is required to
subscribe to a certain amount of shares issued by its Federal Reserve district bank, which pays
cumulative dividends at a prescribed rate. At both December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Corporation had
paid $ 5.4billion for half of its subscribed shares, with the remaining half subject to call by the
Federal Reserve district bank board, which the Corporation believes is remote. Other Guarantees Bank-
owned Life Insurance Book Value Protection The Corporation sells products that offer book value
protection to insurance carriers who offer group life insurance policies to corporations, primarily
banks. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the notional amount of these guarantees totaled $ 3.3billion
and $ 3.8billion. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Corporation’s maximum exposure related to these
guarantees totaled $ 506million and $ 577million, with estimated maturity dates between 2034 and
2037. Indemnifications In the ordinary course of business, the Corporation enters into various
agreements that contain indemnifications, such as tax indemnifications, whereupon payment may become
due if certain external events occur, such as a change in tax law. The indemnification clauses are
often standard contractual terms and were entered into in the normal course of business based on an
assessment that the risk of loss would be remote. These agreements typically contain an early
termination clause that permits the Corporation to exit the agreement upon these events. The maximum
potential future payment under indemnification agreements is difficult to assess for several reasons,
including the occurrence of an external event, the inability to predict future changes in tax and
other laws, the difficulty in determining how such laws would apply to parties in contracts, the
absence of exposure limits contained in standard contract language and the timing of any early
termination clauses. Historically, any payments made under these guarantees have been de minimis. The
Corporation has assessed the probability of making such payments in the future as remote.
 Bank of America136 
Merchant Services The Corporation in its role as merchant acquirer or as a sponsor of other merchant
acquirers may be held liable for any reversed charges that cannot be collected from the merchants due
to, among other things, merchant fraud or insolvency. If charges are properly reversed after a
purchase and cannot be collected from either the merchants or merchant acquirers, the Corporation may
be held liable for these reversed charges. The ability to reverse a charge is primarily governed by
the applicable payment network rules and regulations, which include, but are not limited to, the type
of charge, type of payment used and time limits. The total amount of transactions subject to reversal
under payment network rules and regulations processed for the preceding six-month period, which was
approximately $ 197billion, is an estimate of the Corporation’s maximum potential exposure as of
December 31, 2024. The Corporation’s risk in this area primarily relates to circumstances where a
cardholder has purchased goods or services for future delivery. The Corporation mitigates this risk
by requiring cash deposits, guarantees, letters of credit or other types of collateral from certain
merchants. The Corporation’s reserves for contingent losses, and the losses incurred related to the
merchant processing activity were not significant. Exchange and Clearing House Member Guarantees The
Corporation is a member of various securities and derivative exchanges and clearinghouses, both in
the U.S. and other countries. As a member, the Corporation may be required to pay a pro-rata share of
the losses incurred by some of these organizations as a result of another member default and under
other loss scenarios. The Corporation’s potential obligations may be limited to its membership
interests in such exchanges and clearinghouses, to the amount (or multiple) of the Corporation’s
contribution to the guarantee fund or, in limited instances, to the full pro-rata share of the
residual losses after applying the guarantee fund. The Corporation’s maximum potential exposure under
these membership agreements is difficult to estimate; however, the Corporation has assessed the
probability of making any such payments as remote. Prime Brokerage and Securities Clearing Services
In connection with its prime brokerage and clearing businesses, the Corporation performs securities
clearance and settlement services with other brokerage firms and clearinghouses on behalf of its
clients. Under these arrangements, the Corporation stands ready to meet the obligations of its
clients with respect to securities transactions. The Corporation’s obligations in this respect are
secured by the assets in the clients’ accounts and the accounts of their customers as well as by any
proceeds received from the transactions cleared and settled by the Corporation on behalf of clients
or their customers. The Corporation’s maximum potential exposure under these arrangements is
difficult to estimate; however, the potential for the Corporation to incur material losses pursuant
to these arrangements is remote. Fixed Income Clearing Corporation Sponsored Member Repo Program The
Corporation acts as a sponsoring member in a repo program whereby the Corporation clears certain
eligible resale and repurchase agreements through the Government Securities Division of the Fixed
Income Clearing Corporation on behalf of clients that are sponsored members in accordance with the
Fixed Income Clearing Corporation’s rules. As part of this program, the Corporation guarantees the
payment and performance of its sponsored members to the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation. The
Corporation’s guarantee obligation is secured by a security interest in cash or high-quality
securities collateral placed by clients with the clearinghouse and therefore, the potential for the
Corporation to incur significant losses under this arrangement is remote. The Corporation’s maximum
potential exposure, without taking into consideration the related collateral, was $ 191.9billion and
$ 132.5billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023. Other Guarantees In the normal course of business, the
Corporation periodically guarantees the obligations of its affiliates in a variety of transactions
including ISDA-related transactions and non-ISDA related transactions such as commodities trading,
repurchase agreements, prime brokerage agreements and other transactions. Guarantees of Certain Long-
term Debt The Corporation, as the parent company, fully and unconditionally guarantees the securities
issued by BofA Finance LLC, a consolidated finance subsidiary of the Corporation, and effectively
provides for the full and unconditional guarantee of trust securities and capital securities issued
by certain statutory trust companies that are 100percent owned finance subsidiaries of the
Corporation. Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees The Corporation
securitizes first-lien residential mortgage loans generally in the form of RMBS guaranteed by the
GSEs or by GNMA in the case of FHA-insured, VA-guaranteed and Rural Housing Service-guaranteed
mortgage loans, and sells pools of first-lien residential mortgage loans in the form of whole loans.
In addition, in prior years, legacy companies and certain
 137Bank of America 
subsidiaries sold pools of first-lien residential
mortgage loans and home equity loans as private-
label securitizations or in the form of whole
loans. In connection with these transactions, the
Corporation or certain of its subsidiaries or
legacy companies make and have made various
representations and warranties. Breaches of these
representations and warranties have resulted in
and may continue to result in the requirement to
repurchase mortgage loans or to otherwise make
whole or provide indemnification or other
remedies to sponsors, investors, securitization
trusts, guarantors, insurers or other parties
(collectively, repurchases). Unresolved
Repurchase Claims Unresolved representations and
warranties repurchase claims represent the
notional amount of repurchase claims made by
counterparties, typically the outstanding
principal balance or the unpaid principal balance
at the time of default. In the case of first-lien
mortgages, the claim amount is often
significantly greater than the expected loss
amount due to the benefit of collateral and, in
some cases, mortgage insurance or mortgage
guarantee payments. The notional amount of
unresolved repurchase claims at December 31, 2024
and 2023 was $ 2.1billion and $ 5.4billion. These
balances included $ 837million and $ 2.2billion
at December 31, 2024 and 2023 of claims related
to loans in specific private-label securitization
groups or tranches where the Corporation owns
substantially all of the outstanding securities
or will otherwise realize the benefit of any
repurchase claims paid. During 2024, the
Corporation received $ 181million in new
repurchase claims that were not time-barred.
During 2024, $ 3.5billion in claims were
resolved. Reserve and Related Provision The
reserve for representations and warranties
obligations and corporate guarantees was $
184million and $ 604million at December 31, 2024
and 2023 and is included in accrued expenses and
other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance
Sheet, and the related provision is included in
other income in the Consolidated Statement of
Income. The representations and warranties
reserve represents the Corporation’s best
estimate of probable incurred losses, is based on
its experience in previous negotiations, and is
subject to judgment, a variety of assumptions and
known or unknown uncertainties. At December 31,
2024, the estimated range of possible loss in
excess of the accrued representations and
warranties reserve was not significant. Future
representations and warranties losses may occur
in excess of the amounts recorded for these
exposures; however, the Corporation does not
expect such amounts to be material to the
Corporation's financial condition and liquidity.
Other Contingencies In 2023, the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation (FDIC) issued a final rule
to impose a special assessment to recover certain
estimated losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund
(DIF) arising from the closures of Silicon Valley
Bank and Signature Bank. The estimated losses
will be recovered through quarterly special
assessments collected from certain insured
depository institutions, including the
Corporation, and collection began during the
three months ended June 30, 2024. As of December
31, 2024 and 2023, the Corporation’s accrual for
its estimated share of the FDIC special
assessment was $ 1.7billion and $ 2.1billion. The
Corporation continues to monitor the FDIC’s
estimated loss to the DIF, which could affect the
amount of its accrued liability.
Litigation and Regulatory Matters In the ordinary
course of business, the Corporation and its
subsidiaries are routinely defendants in or
parties to many pending and threatened legal,
regulatory and governmental actions and
proceedings. In view of the inherent difficulty
of predicting the outcome of such matters,
particularly where the claimants seek very large
or indeterminate damages or where the matters
present novel legal theories or involve a large
number of parties, the Corporation generally
cannot predict the eventual outcome of the
pending matters, timing of the ultimate
resolution of these matters, or eventual loss,
fines or penalties related to each pending
matter. As a matter develops, the Corporation, in
conjunction with any outside counsel handling the
matter, evaluates whether such matter presents a
loss contingency that is probable and estimable,
and, for the matters disclosed below, whether a
loss in excess of any accrued liability is
reasonably possible in future periods. Once the
loss contingency is deemed to be both probable
and estimable, the Corporation will establish an
accrued liability and record a corresponding
amount of litigation-related expense. The
Corporation continues to monitor the matter for
further developments that could affect the amount
of the accrued liability that has been previously
established. Excluding expenses of internal and
external legal service providers, litigation and
regulatory investigation-related expense of $
266million, $ 519million and $ 1.2billion was
recognized in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
For any matter disclosed in this Note for which a
loss in future periods is reasonably possible and
estimable (whether in excess of an accrued
liability or where there is no accrued
liability), the Corporation’s estimated range of
possible loss is $ 0to $ 0.8billion in excess of
the accrued liability, if any, as of December 31,
2024.
 Bank of America138 
The accrued liability and estimated range of possible loss are based upon currently available
information and subject to significant judgment, a variety of assumptions and known and unknown
uncertainties. The matters underlying the accrued liability and estimated range of possible loss are
unpredictable and may change from time to time, and actual losses may vary significantly from the
current estimate and accrual. The estimated range of possible loss does not represent the
Corporation’s maximum loss exposure. Information is provided below regarding the nature of the
litigation or other contingency and, where specified, associated claimed damages. Based on current
knowledge, and taking into account accrued liabilities, management does not believe that loss
contingencies arising from pending matters, including the matters described below, will have a
material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition or liquidity of the Corporation.
However, in light of the significant judgment, variety of assumptions and uncertainties involved in
those matters, some of which are beyond the Corporation’s control, and the very large or
indeterminate damages sought in some of those matters, an adverse outcome in one or more of those
matters could be material to the Corporation’s business or results of operations for any particular
reporting period, or cause significant reputational harm. Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering and
Economic Sanctions Compliance BANA agreed to a Consent Order announced by the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) on December 23, 2024, and the Corporation continues to respond to
requests for information from other regulators, relating to certain aspects of its BSA/AML and
Economic Sanctions Compliance Programs (Programs). Since late 2023, the Corporation has been working
with regulators to make changes to its Programs and has already completed significant steps to
satisfy requirements of the Consent Order. The Corporation does not believe that these issues
relating to the Programs will have a material adverse financial impact on the Corporation. CFPB
Lawsuit Related to Processing Electronic Payments On December 20, 2024, the Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau (CFPB) filed suit against BANA, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.,
and Early Warning Services, LLC in the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona with respect
to BANA’s and co-defendants’ processing of electronic payments of funds through the Zelle network.
The CFPB alleges that BANA and its co-defendants violated the Consumer Financial Protection Act by
not adequately protecting consumers from fraud on the Zelle network and the Electronic Fund Transfer
Act by not reasonably investigating and reimbursing disputed Zelle transfers, and seeks both monetary
and injunctive relief. Deposit Insurance Assessment In 2017, the FDIC filed suit against BANA in the
U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia (District Court) alleging that BANA underpaid
assessments to the DIF in the 2012-2014 time frame in the amount of $ 1.12billion and asserting
claims under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and for unjust enrichment. The FDIC Enforcement
Section is also conducting a parallel investigation related to the same alleged underpayments. BANA
disputes the FDIC’s claims and has asserted counterclaims challenging the FDIC’s regulations under
the Administrative Procedure Act. Pending final resolution, BANA has pledged security satisfactory to
the FDIC related to the disputed additional assessment amounts. On July 1, 2024, the District Court
judge vacated the magistrate judge’s April 2023 report and recommendation for resolving the parties’
cross-motions for summary judgment, and asked the parties to file new motions. The parties
subsequently filed their new summary judgment motions, which are pending. LIBOR Beginning in 2011,
several individual and putative class actions were filed against the Corporation, BANA, and certain
Merrill Lynch entities, as well as other banks on the U.S. Dollar LIBOR panel. These actions alleged
that defendants manipulated LIBOR during the financial crisis and asserted a variety of claims,
including federal and state antitrust, Commodity Exchange Act, Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act, Securities Exchange Act of 1934, common law fraud, and breach of contract claims
and sought compensatory, treble and punitive damages, and injunctive relief. All remaining cases are
pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Defendants’ motion for
summary judgment is pending on all remaining claims, brought by individual plaintiffs and one class
of plaintiffs who purchased over-the-counter instruments incorporating LIBOR. Unemployment Insurance
Prepaid Cards Beginning in January 2021, BANA was named as a defendant in putative class action and
mass action lawsuits related to its administration of prepaid debit cards to distribute unemployment
and other state benefits for the State of California, which was the largest program administered by
BANA as measured by total benefits and number of participants. These lawsuits have been consolidated
into a multidistrict litigation in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California
where plaintiffs assert claims for violations of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, state statutory
and common law claims and due process, and seek monetary damages and injunctive relief based on
allegations that BANA failed to properly investigate and remediate cardholder claims of fraudulent
transactions and to prevent fraud, among other allegations.

During 2024, in connection with employee stock
plans, the Corporation issued 75million shares of
its common stock and, to satisfy tax withholding
obligations, repurchased 28million shares of
common stock. At December 31, 2024, the
Corporation had reserved 552million unissued
shares of common stock for future issuances under
employee stock plans, convertible notes and
preferred stock.
Preferred Stock
The cash dividends declared on preferred stock
were $ 1.6billion in 2024, 2023 and 2022.
During 2024, the Corporation fully redeemed
Series X, Series U, Series JJ and Series Z stock
at their liquidation preference values for a
total of $ 5.3billion.
All series of preferred stock in the Preferred Stock Summary table have a par value of $ 0.01per
share, are not subject to the operation of a sinking fund, have no participation rights, and with the
exception of the Series L Preferred Stock, are not convertible. The holders of the Series B Preferred
Stock and Series 1 through 5 Preferred Stock have general voting rights and vote together with the
common stock. The holders of the other series included in the table have no general voting rights.
All outstanding series of preferred stock of the Corporation have preference over the Corporation’s
common stock with respect to the payment of dividends and distribution of the Corporation’s assets in
the event of a liquidation or dissolution. With the exception of the Series B, F and G Preferred
Stock, if any dividend payable on these series is in arrears for threeor more semi-annual or sixor
more quarterly dividend periods, as applicable (whether consecutive or not), the holders of these
series and any other class or series of preferred stock ranking equally as to payment of dividends
and upon which equivalent voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable (voting as a single
class) will be entitled to vote for the election of twoadditional directors. These voting rights
terminate when the Corporation has paid in full dividends on these series for at least twosemi-annual
or fourquarterly dividend periods, as applicable, following the dividend arrearage. The 7.25% Non-
Cumulative Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock, Series L (Series L Preferred Stock) does not have
early redemption/call rights. Each share of the Series L Preferred Stock may be converted at any
time, at the option of the holder, into 20shares of the Corporation’s common stock plus cash in lieu
of fractional shares. The Corporation may cause some or all of the Series L Preferred Stock, at its
option, at any time or from time to time, to be converted into shares of common stock at the then-
applicable conversion rate if, for 20trading days during any period of 30consecutive trading days,
the closing price of common stock exceeds 130percent of the then-applicable conversion price of the
Series L Preferred Stock. If a conversion of Series L Preferred Stock occurs at the option of the
holder, subsequent to a dividend record date but prior to the dividend payment date, the Corporation
will still pay any accrued dividends payable. The following table presents a summary of perpetual
preferred stock outstanding at December 31, 2024.

NOTE 16 Regulatory Requirements and Restrictions
The Federal Reserve, OCC and FDIC (collectively, U.S. banking regulators) jointly establish
regulatory capital adequacy rules, including Basel 3, for U.S. banking organizations. As a financial
holding company, the Corporation is subject to capital adequacy rules issued by the Federal Reserve.
The Corporation’s banking entity affiliates are subject to capital adequacy rules issued by the OCC.
The Corporation and its primary banking entity affiliate, BANA, are Advanced approaches institutions
under Basel 3. As Advanced approaches institutions, the Corporation and its
banking entity affiliates are required to report regulatory risk-based capital ratios and risk-
weighted assets under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches. The approach that yields the
lower ratio is used to assess capital adequacy, including under the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA)
framework. The Corporation is required to maintain a minimum supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) of
3.0 percent plus a leverage buffer of 2.0 percent in order to avoid certain restrictions on capital
distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. The Corporation’s insured
depository institution subsidiaries are required to maintain a minimum 6.0 percent SLR to be
considered well capitalized under the PCA framework. The following table presents capital ratios and
related information in accordance with Basel 3 Standardized and Advanced approaches as measured at
December 31, 2024 and 2023 for the Corporation and BANA.

 ratio 
(1) As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, capital ratios are calculated using the regulatory capital rule
that allows a five-year transition period related to the adoption of the current expected credit
losses accounting standard on January 1, 2020.
(2) The CET1 capital regulatory minimum is the sum of the CET1 capital ratio minimum of 4.5 percent,
the Corporation’s G-SIB surcharge of 3.0percent at December 31, 2024 and 2.5percent at December 31,
2023, and SCB (under the Standardized approach) of 3.2percent at December 31, 2024 and 2.5percent at
December 31, 2023. The countercyclical capital buffer was zero for both periods. The SLR regulatory
minimum includes a leverage buffer of 2.0 percent.
(3) Risk-based capital regulatory minimums at both December 31, 2024 and 2023 are the minimum ratios
under Basel 3 including a capital conservation buffer of 2.5percent. The regulatory minimums for the
leverage ratios as of both period ends are the percent required to be considered well capitalized
under the PCA framework.
(4) Total capital under the Advanced approaches differs from the Standardized approach due to
differences in the amount permitted in Tier 2 capital related to the qualifying allowance for credit
losses.
(5) Reflects total average assets adjusted for certain Tier 1 capital deductions.
The capital adequacy rules issued by the U.S.
banking regulators require institutions to meet
the established minimums outlined in the table
above. Failure to meet the minimum requirements
can lead to certain mandatory and discretionary
actions by regulators that could have a material
adverse impact on the Corporation’s financial
position. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the
Corporation and its banking entity affiliates
were well capitalized. Other Regulatory Matters
At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Corporation
had cash and cash equivalents in the amount of $
4.0billion and $ 3.6billion, and securities with
a fair value of $ 18.3billion and $ 18.0billion
that were segregated in compliance with
securities regulations. Cash and cash equivalents
segregated in compliance with securities
regulations are a component of restricted cash.
For more information, see Note 10 – Securities
Financing Agreements, Short-term Borrowings,
Collateral and Restricted Cash . In addition, at
December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Corporation had
cash deposited with clearing organizations of $
21.5billion and $ 23.7billion primarily recorded
in other assets on the Consolidated Balance
Sheet.
Bank Subsidiary Distributions The primary sources
of funds for cash distributions by the
Corporation to its shareholders are capital
distributions received from its bank
subsidiaries, BANA and Bank of America
California, N.A. In 2024, the Corporation
received dividends of $ 20.8billion from BANA and
$ 500million from Bank of America California,
N.A.
The amount of dividends that a subsidiary bank
may declare in a calendar year without OCC
approval is the subsidiary bank’s net profits for
that year combined with its retained net profits
for the preceding two years. Retained net
profits, as defined by the OCC, consist of net
income less dividends declared during the period.
In 2025, BANA can declare and pay dividends of
approximately $ 13.0billion to the Corporation
plus an additional amount equal to its retained
net profits for 2025 up to the date of any such
dividend declaration.

NOTE 17 Employee Benefit Plans
Pension and Postretirement Plans The Corporation sponsors a qualified noncontributory trusteed
pension plan (Qualified Pension Plan), a number of noncontributory nonqualified pension plans and
postretirement health and life plans that cover eligible employees. Non-U.S. pension plans sponsored
by the Corporation vary based on the country and local practices. The Qualified Pension Plan has a
balance guarantee feature for account balances with participant-selected investments, applied at the
time a benefit payment is made from the plan that effectively provides principal protection for
participant balances transferred and certain compensation credits. The Corporation is responsible for
funding any shortfall on the guarantee feature. Benefits earned under the Qualified Pension Plan have
been frozen. Thereafter, the cash balance accounts continue to earn investment credits or interest
credits in accordance with the terms of the plan document. The Corporation has an annuity contract
that guarantees the payment of benefits vested under a terminated U.S. pension plan (Other Pension
Plan). The Corporation, under a supplemental agreement, may be responsible for or benefit from actual
experience and investment performance of the annuity assets. The Corporation made nocontribution
under this agreement in 2024 or 2023. Contributions may be required in the future under this
agreement.
The Corporation’s noncontributory, nonqualified pension plans are unfunded and provide supplemental
defined pension benefits to certain eligible employees. In addition to retirement pension benefits,
certain benefits-eligible employees may become eligible to continue participation as retirees in
health care and/or life insurance plans sponsored by the Corporation. These plans are referred to as
the Postretirement Health and Life Plans. The Pension and Postretirement Plans table summarizes the
changes in the fair value of plan assets, changes in the projected benefit obligation (PBO), the
funded status of both the accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) and the PBO, and the weighted-average
assumptions used to determine benefit obligations for the pension plans and postretirement plans at
December 31, 2024 and 2023. The estimate of the Corporation’s PBO associated with these plans
considers various actuarial assumptions, including assumptions for mortality rates and discount
rates. The discount rate assumptions are derived from a cash flow matching technique that utilizes
rates that are based on Aa-rated corporate bonds with cash flows that match estimated benefit
payments of each of the plans. The increases in the weighted-average discount rates in 2024 resulted
in a decrease to the PBO of $ 767million at December 31, 2024. The decreases in the weighted-average
discount rates in 2023 resulted in an increase to the PBO of approximately $ 511million at December
31, 2023. Significant gains and losses related to changes in the PBO for 2024 and 2023 primarily
resulted from changes in the discount rate.

The Corporation’s estimate of its contributions to be made to the Non-U.S. Pension Plans,
Nonqualified and Other Pension Plans, and Postretirement Health and Life Plans in 2025 is $
13million, $ 90million and $ 29million, respectively. The Corporation does notexpect to make a
contribution to the Qualified Pension Plan in 2025. It is the policy of the Corporation to fund no
less than the minimum funding amount required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
(ERISA). Pension Plans with ABO and PBO in excess of plan assets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 are
presented in the table below. For these plans, funding strategies vary due to legal requirements and

The asset valuation method used to calculate the expected return on plan assets component of net
periodic benefit cost for the Qualified Pension Plan recognizes 60percent of the prior year’s market
gains or losses at the next measurement date with the remaining 40percent spread equally over the
subsequent four years. Gains and losses for all benefit plans except postretirement health care are
recognized in accordance with the standard amortization provisions of the applicable accounting
guidance. Net periodic postretirement health and life expense was determined using the “projected
unit credit” actuarial method. For the U.S. Postretirement Health Plans, 50percent of the
unrecognized gain or loss at the beginning of the year (or at subsequent remeasurement) is recognized
on a level basis during the year. Assumed health care cost trend rates affect the postretirement
benefit obligation and benefit cost reported for the Postretirement Health and Life Plans. The
assumed health care cost trend rate used to measure the expected cost of benefits covered by the U.S.
Postretirement Health and Life Plans is 6.25percent for 2025, reducing in steps to 5.00percent in
2028 and later years. The Corporation’s net periodic benefit cost (income) recognized for the plans
is sensitive to the discount rate and expected return on plan assets. For the Qualified Pension Plan,
Non-U.S. Pension Plans, Nonqualified and Other Pension Plans, and Postretirement Health and Life
Plans, a 25 bps decline in discount rates and expected return on assets would not have had a
significant impact on the net periodic benefit cost for 2024.

Plan Assets The Qualified Pension Plan has been established as a retirement vehicle for participants,
and trusts have been established to secure benefits promised under the Qualified Pension Plan. The
Corporation’s policy is to invest the trust assets in a prudent manner for the exclusive purpose of
providing benefits to participants and defraying reasonable expenses of administration. The
Corporation’s investment strategy is designed to provide a total return that, over the long term,
increases the ratio of assets to liabilities. The strategy attempts to maximize the investment return
on assets at a level of risk deemed appropriate by the Corporation while complying with ERISA and any
applicable regulations and laws. The investment strategy utilizes asset allocation as a principal
determinant for establishing the risk/return profile of the assets. Asset allocation ranges are
established, periodically reviewed and adjusted as funding levels and liability characteristics
change. Active and passive investment managers are employed to help enhance the risk/return profile
of the assets. An additional aspect of the investment strategy used to minimize risk (part of the
asset allocation plan) includes matching the exposure of participant-selected investment measures.
The assets of the Non-U.S. Pension Plans are primarily attributable to a U.K. pension plan. This U.K.
pension plan’s assets are invested prudently so that the benefits promised to members are provided
with consideration given to the nature and the duration of the plans’ liabilities. The selected asset
allocation strategy is designed to achieve a higher return than the lowest risk strategy. The
expected rate of return on plan assets assumption was developed through analysis of historical market
returns, historical asset class volatility and correlations, current market conditions, anticipated
future asset allocations, the funds’ past experience and expectations on potential future market
returns. The expected return on plan assets assumption is determined using the calculated market-
related value for the Qualified Pension Plan and the Other Pension Plan and the fair value for the
Non-U.S. Pension Plans and Postretirement Health and Life Plans. The expected return on plan assets
assumption represents a long-term average view of the performance of the assets in the Qualified
Pension Plan, the Non-U.S. Pension Plans, the Other Pension Plan, and Postretirement Health and Life
Plans, a return that may or may not be achieved during any one calendar year. The Other Pension Plan
is invested solely in an annuity contract, which is primarily invested in fixed-income securities
structured such that asset maturities match the duration of the plan’s obligations. The target
allocations for 2025 by asset category for the Qualified Pension Plan, Non-U.S. Pension Plans, and
Nonqualified and Other Pension Plans are presented in the table below. Equity securities for the
Qualified Pension Plan include common stock of the Corporation in the amounts of $ 386million (
2.19percent of total plan assets) and $ 299million ( 1.69percent of total plan assets) at December
31, 2024, and 2023.

Defined Contribution Plans The Corporation
maintains qualified and nonqualified defined
contribution retirement plans. The Corporation
recorded expense of $ 1.3billion in 2024 and $
1.2billion in both 2023 and 2022 related to the
qualified defined contribution plans. At December
31, 2024 and 2023, 153million and 178million
shares of the Corporation’s common stock were
held by these plans. Payments to the plans for
dividends on common stock were $ 165million, $
166million and $ 153million in 2024, 2023 and
2022, respectively. Certain non-U.S. employees
are covered under defined contribution pension
plans that are separately administered in
accordance with local laws. NOTE 18 Stock-based
Compensation Plans The Corporation administers a
number of equity compensation plans, with awards
being granted predominantly from the Bank of
America Corporation Equity Plan (BACEP). Under
this plan, 890million shares of the Corporation’s
common stock are authorized to be used for grants
of awards. During 2024 and 2023, the Corporation
granted 121million and 115million RSUs to certain
employees under the BACEP. These RSUs were
authorized to settle predominantly in shares of
common stock of the Corporation. Certain RSUs
will be settled in cash or contain settlement
provisions that subject these awards to variable
accounting whereby compensation expense is
adjusted to fair value based on changes in the
share price of the Corporation’s common stock up
to the settlement date. The RSUs granted in 2024
and 2023 predominantly vest over four yearsin
one-fourth increments on each of the first four
anniversaries of the grant date, provided that
the employee remains continuously employed with
the Corporation during that time, and will be
expensed ratably over the vesting period, net of
estimated forfeitures, for non-retirement
eligible employees based on the grant-date fair
value of the shares. Of the RSUs granted in 2024
and 2023, 42million in each year do not include
retirement eligibility. For all other RSUs
granted to employees who are retirement eligible,
they are deemed authorized as of the beginning of
the year preceding the grant date when the
incentive award plans are generally approved. As
a result, the estimated value is expensed ratably
over the year preceding the grant date. The
compensation cost for the stock-based plans was $
3.6billion, $ 3.1billion and $ 2.9billion, and
the related income tax benefit was $ 872million,
$ 733million and $ 697million for 2024, 2023 and
2022, respectively. At December 31, 2024, there
was an estimated $ 4.3billion of total
unrecognized compensation cost related to certain
share-based compensation awards that is expected
to be recognized generally over a period of up to
four years, with a weighted-average period of
2.4years.
Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units
The total fair value of restricted stock and
restricted stock units vested in 2024, 2023 and
2022 was $ 2.6billion, $ 2.6billion and $
3.4billion, respectively. The table below
presents the status at December 31, 2024 of the

Total income tax expense does not reflect the tax
effects of items that are included in OCI each
period. For more information, see Note 14 –
Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) .
Other tax effects included in OCI each period
resulted in an expense of $ 1.5billion and $
892million in 2024 and 2023 and a benefit of $
4.9billion in 2022. The increase in the federal
deferred tax benefit in 2024 and 2023 was
primarily driven by increased tax attribute
carryforwards related to the Corporation’s
investments in affordable housing and renewable
energy partnerships and similar investments
compared to 2022.
Income tax expense for 2024, 2023 and 2022 varied
from the amount computed by applying the
statutory income tax rate to income before income
taxes. The Corporation’s federal statutory tax
rate was 21 percent for 2024, 2023 and 2022. A
reconciliation of the expected U.S. federal
income tax expense, calculated by applying the
federal statutory tax rate, to the Corporation’s
actual income tax expense, and the effective tax

Tax Law changes reflect the impact of certain
state legislative enactments in 2023 of
approximately $ 137million and the 2022 U.K.
enacted corporate income tax rate change, which
resulted in a negative tax adjustment of
approximately $ 186million, with corresponding
adjustments of U.K. net deferred tax assets. The
U.K. net deferred tax assets are primarily net
operating losses (NOLs), incurred by the
Corporation’s U.K. broker-dealer entity in
historical periods, which do not expire under
U.K. tax law and are assessed regularly for
impairment. If further U.K. tax law changes are
enacted, a corresponding income tax adjustment
will be made based on the amount of available net
deferred tax assets and applicable tax rate
changes. Tax credits originate from investments
in affordable housing and renewable energy
partnerships and similar entities. Significant
increases in tax credits recognized in 2024 and
2023, compared to 2022, were primarily driven by
the Corporation’s growth in the volume of
investments in wind and solar energy production
facilities. For more information, see Note 6 –
Securitizations and Other Variable Interest
Entities .
The reconciliation of the beginning unrecognized
tax benefits (UTB) balance to the ending balance

items, state items and jurisdictional offsets, as
well as the inclusion of interest in the
Reconciliation of Income Tax Expense table.
At December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the balance
of the Corporation’s UTBs which would, if
recognized, affect the Corporation’s effective
tax rate was $ 573million, $ 671million and $
709million, respectively. Included in the UTB
balance are some items the recognition of which
would not affect the effective tax rate, such as
the tax effect of certain temporary differences,
the portion of gross state UTBs that would be
offset by the tax benefit of the associated
federal deduction and the portion of gross
non-U.S. UTBs that would be offset by tax
reductions in other jurisdictions. It is
reasonably possible that the UTB balance may
decrease by as much as $ 217million during the
next 12 months, since resolved items will be
removed from the balance whether their resolution
results in payment or recognition. The
Corporation recognized an interest benefit of $
9million in 2024, interest expense of $ 35million
in 2023 and interest benefit of $ 50million in
2022. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the
Corporation’s accrual for interest and penalties
that related to income taxes, net of taxes and
remittances, was $ 105million and $ 134million.
The Corporation files income tax returns in more
than 100states and non-U.S. jurisdictions each
year. The IRS and other tax authorities in
countries and states in which the Corporation has
significant business operations examine tax
returns periodically (continuously in some
jurisdictions). The table below summarizes the

(2) The net operating losses and related

considering the benefit of federal deductions
were $ 664million and $ 459million.
Management concluded that novaluation allowance
was necessary to reduce the deferred tax assets
related to the U.K. NOL carryforwards and U.S.
federal and certain state NOL carryforwards since
estimated future taxable income will be
sufficient to utilize these assets prior to their
expiration. Additionally, the Corporation has
U.K. net deferred tax assets, which consist
primarily of NOLs that are expected to be
realized in a U.K. subsidiary over an extended
number of years. Management’s conclusion is
supported by financial results, profit forecasts
for the relevant entity and the indefinite period
to carry forward NOLs. However, a material change
in those estimates could lead management to
reassess such valuation allowance conclusions.
At December 31, 2024, U.S. federal income taxes
had not been provided on approximately $
5.0billion of temporary differences associated
with investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries that
are essentially permanent in duration. If the
Corporation were to record the associated
deferred tax liability, the amount would be
approximately $ 1.0billion.
NOTE 20 Fair Value Measurements Under applicable accounting standards, fair value is defined as the
exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in
the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants on the measurement date. The Corporation determines the fair values of
its financial instruments under applicable accounting standards that require an entity to maximize
the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The Corporation categorizes
its financial instruments into three levels based on the established fair value hierarchy and
conducts a review of fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis. Transfers into or out
of fair value hierarchy classifications are made if the significant inputs used in financial models
measuring the fair values of the assets and liabilities become unobservable or observable,
respectively, in the current marketplace, or when previously insignificant unobservable and
observable inputs become significant, respectively. For more information regarding the fair value
hierarchy and how the Corporation measures fair value, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting
Principles . The Corporation accounts for certain financial instruments under the fair value option.
For more information, see Note 21 – Fair Value Option . Valuation Techniques The following sections
outline the valuation methodologies for the Corporation’s assets and liabilities. While the
Corporation believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market
participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of
certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting
date. During 2024, there were no significant changes to valuation approaches or techniques that had,
or are expected to have, a material impact on the Corporation’s consolidated financial position or
results of operations. Trading Account Assets and Liabilities and Debt Securities The fair values of
trading account assets and liabilities are primarily based on actively traded markets where prices
are based on either direct market quotes or observed transactions. The fair values of debt securities
are generally based on quoted market prices or market prices for similar assets. Liquidity is a
significant factor in the determination of the fair values of trading account assets and liabilities
and debt securities. Market price quotes may not be readily available for some positions such as
positions within a market sector where trading activity has slowed significantly or ceased. Some of
these instruments are valued using a discounted cash flow model, which estimates the fair value of
the securities using internal credit risk, and interest rate and prepayment risk models that
incorporate management’s best estimate of current key assumptions such as default rates, loss
severity and prepayment rates. Principal and interest cash flows are discounted using an observable
discount rate for similar instruments with adjustments that management believes a market participant
would consider in determining fair value for the specific security. Other instruments are valued
using a net asset value approach that considers the value of the underlying securities. Underlying
assets are valued using external pricing services, where available, or matrix pricing based on the
vintages and ratings. Situations of illiquidity generally are triggered by the market’s perception of
credit uncertainty regarding a single company or a specific market sector. In these
 151Bank of America 
instances, fair value is determined based on limited available market information and other factors,
principally from reviewing the issuer’s financial statements and changes in credit ratings made by
one or more rating agencies. Derivative Assets and Liabilities The fair values of derivative assets
and liabilities traded in the OTC market are determined using quantitative models that utilize
multiple market inputs including interest rates, prices and indices to generate continuous yield or
pricing curves and volatility factors to value the position. The majority of market inputs are
actively quoted and can be validated through external sources, including brokers, market transactions
and third-party pricing services. When third-party pricing services are used, the methods and
assumptions are reviewed by the Corporation. Estimation risk is greater for derivative asset and
liability positions that are either option-based or have longer maturity dates where observable
market inputs are less readily available, or are unobservable, in which case, quantitative-based
extrapolations of rate, price or index scenarios are used in determining fair values. The fair values
of derivative assets and liabilities include adjustments for market liquidity, counterparty credit
quality and other instrument-specific factors, where appropriate. In addition, the Corporation
incorporates within its fair value measurements of OTC derivatives a valuation adjustment to reflect
the credit risk associated with the net position. Positions are netted by counterparty, and fair
value for net long exposures is adjusted for counterparty credit risk while the fair value for net
short exposures is adjusted for the Corporation’s own credit risk. The Corporation also incorporates
FVA within its fair value measurements to include funding costs on uncollateralized derivatives and
derivatives where the Corporation is not permitted to use the collateral it receives. An estimate of
severity of loss is also used in the determination of fair value, primarily based on market data.
Loans and Loan Commitments The fair values of loans and loan commitments are based on market prices,
where available, or discounted cash flow analyses using market-based credit spreads of comparable
debt instruments or credit derivatives of the specific borrower or comparable borrowers. Results of
discounted cash flow analyses may be adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect other market conditions or
the perceived credit risk of the borrower. Mortgage Servicing Rights The fair values of MSRs are
primarily determined using an option-adjusted spread valuation approach, which factors in prepayment
risk to determine the fair value of MSRs. This approach consists of projecting servicing cash flows
under multiple interest rate scenarios and discounting these cash flows using risk-adjusted discount
rates. Loans Held-for-sale The fair values of LHFS are based on quoted market prices, where
available, or are determined by discounting estimated cash flows using interest rates approximating
the Corporation’s current origination rates for similar loans adjusted to reflect the inherent credit
risk. The borrower-specific credit risk is embedded within the market prices, where available, or is
implied by considering loan performance when selecting comparables. Short-term Borrowings and Long-
term Debt The Corporation issues structured liabilities that have coupons or repayment terms linked
to the performance of debt or equity securities, interest rates, indices, currencies or commodities.
The fair values of these structured liabilities are estimated using quantitative models for the
combined derivative and debt portions of the notes. These models incorporate observable and, in some
instances, unobservable inputs including security prices, interest rate yield curves, option
volatility, currency, commodity or equity rates and correlations among these inputs. The Corporation
also considers the impact of its own credit spread in determining the discount rate used to value
these liabilities. The credit spread is determined by reference to observable spreads in the
secondary bond market. Securities Financing Agreements The fair values of certain reverse repurchase
agreements, repurchase agreements and securities borrowed transactions are determined using
quantitative models, including discounted cash flow models that require the use of multiple market
inputs including interest rates and spreads to generate continuous yield or pricing curves, and
volatility factors. The majority of market inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through
external sources, including brokers, market transactions and third-party pricing services. Deposits
The fair values of deposits are determined using quantitative models, including discounted cash flow
models that require the use of multiple market inputs including interest rates and spreads to
generate continuous yield or pricing curves, and volatility factors. The majority of market inputs
are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources, including brokers, market
transactions and third-party pricing services. The Corporation considers the impact of its own credit
spread in the valuation of these liabilities. The credit risk is determined by reference to
observable credit spreads in the secondary cash market. Asset-backed Secured Financings The fair
values of asset-backed secured financings are based on external broker bids, where available, or are
determined by discounting estimated cash flows using interest rates approximating the Corporation’s
current origination rates for similar loans, adjusted to reflect the inherent credit risk.

The following tables present a reconciliation of all assets and liabilities measured at fair value on
a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) during 2024, 2023 and 2022,
including net realized and unrealized gains (losses) included in earnings and accumulated OCI.
Transfers into Level 3 occur primarily due to decreased price observability, and transfers out of
Level 3 occur primarily due to increased price observability. Transfers occur on a regular basis for
long-term debt instruments due to changes in the impact of unobservable inputs on the value of the
embedded derivative in relation to the instrument as a whole.

(1) For loans and securities, structured liabilities and net derivative assets (liabilities), the
weighted average is calculated based upon the absolute fair value of the instruments.
(2) The categories are aggregated based upon product type, which differs from financial statement
classification. The following is a reconciliation to the line items in the table on page 153: Trading
account assets – Corporate securities, trading loans and other of $ 1.8billion, Trading account
assets – Non-U.S. sovereign debt of $ 344million, Trading account assets – Mortgage trading loans,

(1) For loans and securities, structured liabilities and net derivative assets (liabilities), the
weighted average is calculated based upon the absolute fair value of the instruments.
(2) The categories are aggregated based upon product type, which differs from financial statement
classification. The following is a reconciliation to the line items in the table on page 154: Trading
account assets – Corporate securities, trading loans and other of $ 1.7billion, Trading account
assets – Non-U.S. sovereign debt of $ 396million, Trading account assets – Mortgage trading loans,
MBS and ABS of $ 1.2billion, AFS debt securities of $ 376million, Other debt securities carried at

In the previous tables, instruments backed by
residential and commercial real estate assets
include RMBS, commercial MBS, whole loans and
mortgage CDOs. Commercial loans, debt securities
and other include corporate CLOs and CDOs,
commercial loans and bonds, and securities backed
by non-real estate assets. Structured liabilities
primarily include equity-linked notes that are
accounted for under the fair value option. The
Corporation uses multiple market approaches in
valuing certain of its Level 3 financial
instruments. For example, market comparables and
discounted cash flows are used together. For a
given product, such as corporate debt securities,
market comparables may be used to estimate some
of the unobservable inputs, and then these inputs
are incorporated into a discounted cash flow
model. Therefore, the balances disclosed
encompass both of these techniques. The levels of
aggregation and diversity within the products
disclosed in the tables result in certain ranges
of inputs being wide and unevenly distributed
across asset and liability categories.
Uncertainty of Fair Value Measurements from
Unobservable Inputs Loans and Securities A
significant increase in market yields, default
rates, loss severities or duration would have
resulted in a significantly lower fair value for
long positions. Short positions would have been
impacted in a directionally opposite way. The
impact of changes in prepayment speeds would have
resulted in differing impacts depending on the
seniority of the instrument and, in the case of
CLOs, whether prepayments can be reinvested. A
significant increase in price would have resulted
in a significantly higher fair value for long
positions, and short positions would have been
impacted in a directionally opposite way.
Structured Liabilities and Derivatives For credit
derivatives, a significant increase in market
yield, upfront points (i.e., a single upfront
payment made by a
protection buyer at inception), credit spreads,
default rates or loss severities would have
resulted in a significantly lower fair value for
protection sellers and higher fair value for
protection buyers. The impact of changes in
prepayment speeds would have resulted in
differing impacts depending on the seniority of
the instrument. Structured credit derivatives are
impacted by credit correlation. Default
correlation is a parameter that describes the
degree of dependence among credit default rates
within a credit portfolio that underlies a credit
derivative instrument. The sensitivity of this
input on the fair value varies depending on the
level of subordination of the tranche. For senior
tranches that are net purchases of protection, a
significant increase in default correlation would
have resulted in a significantly higher fair
value. Net short protection positions would have
been impacted in a directionally opposite way.
For equity derivatives, commodity derivatives,
interest rate derivatives and structured
liabilities, a significant change in long-dated
rates and volatilities and correlation inputs
(i.e., the degree of correlation between an
equity security and an index, between two
different commodities, between two different
interest rates, or between interest rates and
foreign exchange rates) would have resulted in a
significant impact to the fair value; however,
the magnitude and direction of the impact depend
on whether the Corporation is long or short the
exposure. For structured liabilities, a
significant increase in yield or decrease in
price would have resulted in a significantly
lower fair value.
Nonrecurring Fair Value The Corporation holds
certain assets that are measured at fair value
only in certain situations (e.g., the impairment
of an asset), and these measurements are referred
to herein as nonrecurring. The amounts below
represent assets still held as of the reporting
date for which a nonrecurring fair value

NOTE 21 Fair Value Option
Loans and Loan Commitments The Corporation elects to account for certain loans and loan commitments
that exceed the Corporation’s single-name credit risk concentration guidelines under the fair value
option. Lending commitments are actively managed and, as appropriate, credit risk for these lending
relationships may be mitigated through the use of credit derivatives, with the Corporation’s public
side credit view and market perspectives determining the size and timing of the hedging activity.
These credit derivatives do not meet the requirements for designation as accounting hedges and are
carried at fair value. The fair value option allows the Corporation to carry these loans and loan
commitments at fair value, which is more consistent with management’s view of the underlying
economics and the manner in which they are managed. In addition, the fair value option allows the
Corporation to reduce the accounting volatility that would otherwise result from the asymmetry
created by accounting for the financial instruments at historical cost and the credit derivatives at
fair value. Loans Held-for-sale The Corporation elects to account for residential mortgage LHFS,
commercial mortgage LHFS and certain other LHFS under the fair value option. These loans are actively
managed and monitored and, as appropriate, certain market risks of the loans may be mitigated through
the use of derivatives. The Corporation has elected not to designate the derivatives as qualifying
accounting hedges, and therefore, they are carried at fair value. The changes in fair value of the
loans are largely offset by changes in the fair value of the derivatives. The fair value option
allows the Corporation to reduce the accounting volatility that would otherwise result from the
asymmetry created by accounting for the financial instruments at the lower of cost or fair value and
the derivatives at fair value. The Corporation has not elected to account for certain other LHFS
under the fair value option primarily because these loans are floating-rate loans that are not hedged
using derivative instruments.
Loans Reported as Trading Account Assets The Corporation elects to account for certain loans that are
held for the purpose of trading and are risk-managed on a fair value basis under the fair value
option. Other Assets The Corporation elects to account for certain long-term fixed-rate margin loans
that are hedged with derivatives under the fair value option. Election of the fair value option
allows the Corporation to reduce the accounting volatility that would otherwise result from the
asymmetry created by accounting for the financial instruments at historical cost and the derivatives
at fair value. Securities Financing Agreements The Corporation elects to account for certain
securities financing agreements, including resale and repurchase agreements, under the fair value
option. These elections include certain agreements collateralized by the U.S. government and its
agencies, which are generally short-dated and have minimal interest rate risk. Long-term Deposits The
Corporation elects to account for certain long-term fixed-rate and rate-linked deposits that are
hedged with derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting. Election of the fair value option
allows the Corporation to reduce the accounting volatility that would otherwise result from the
asymmetry created by accounting for the financial instruments at historical cost and the derivatives
at fair value. The Corporation has not elected to carry other long-term deposits at fair value
because they are not hedged using derivatives. Short-term Borrowings The Corporation elects to
account for certain short-term borrowings, primarily short-term structured liabilities, under the
fair value option because this debt is risk-managed on a fair value basis.
 Bank of America160 
The Corporation also elects to account for certain asset-backed secured financings, which are also
classified in short-term borrowings, under the fair value option. Election of the fair value option
allows the Corporation to reduce the accounting volatility that would otherwise result from the
asymmetry created by accounting for the asset-backed secured financings at historical cost and the
corresponding mortgage LHFS securing these financings at fair value. Long-term Debt The Corporation
elects to account for certain long-term debt, primarily structured liabilities, under the fair value
option. This long-term debt is either risk-managed on a fair value basis or the related hedges do not
qualify for hedge accounting. Fair Value Option Elections The following tables provide information
about the fair value carrying amount and the contractual principal outstanding of assets and
liabilities accounted for under the fair value option at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and information
about where changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities accounted for under the fair value
option are included in the Consolidated Statement of Income for 2024, 2023 and 2022.

 Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
Financial instruments are classified within the fair value hierarchy using the methodologies
described in Note 20 – Fair Value Measurements . Certain loans, deposits, long-term debt, unfunded
lending commitments and other financial instruments are accounted for under the fair value option.
For more information, see Note 21 – Fair Value Option . The following disclosures include financial
instruments that are not carried at fair value or only a portion of the ending balance is carried at
fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Short-term Financial Instruments The carrying value of
short-term financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, certain time deposits placed
and other short-term investments, federal funds sold and purchased,
 Bank of America162 
certain resale and repurchase agreements and
short-term borrowings, approximates the fair
value of these instruments. These financial
instruments generally expose the Corporation to
limited credit risk and have no stated maturities
or have short-term maturities and carry interest
rates that approximate market. The Corporation
accounts for certain resale and repurchase
agreements under the fair value option.
Under the fair value hierarchy, cash and cash
equivalents are classified as Level 1. Time
deposits placed and other short-term investments,
such as U.S. government securities and short-term
commercial paper, are classified as Level 1 or
Level 2. Federal funds sold and purchased are
classified as Level 2. Resale and repurchase
agreements are classified as Level 2 because they
are generally short-dated and/or variable-rate
instruments collateralized by U.S. government or
agency securities. Short-term borrowings are
generally classified as Level 2.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The carrying values and fair values by fair value

of consumer unfunded lending commitments because, in many instances, the Corporation can reduce or
cancel these commitments by providing notice to the borrower. For more information on commitments,
see Note 12 – Commitments and Contingencies.
NOTE 23 Business Segment Information The Corporation reports its results of operations through the
following fourbusiness segments: Consumer Banking , Global Wealth & Investment Management, Global
Banking and Global Markets , with the remaining operations recorded in All Other . The segments are
managed by the Corporation’s Management Team, with certain leaders responsible for each segment
and/or the lines of business supporting the segments. On a continual basis, the Management Team
assesses the performance of the segments by comparing the segments’ budgeted income and expenses to
their actual results. The Chief Operating Decision Maker of the segments, which is the Corporation’s
CEO, is the final approver on the amount of capital to allocate to each segment. Consumer Banking
Consumer Banking offers a diversified range of credit, banking and investment products and services

Global Markets Global Markets offers sales and trading services and research services to
institutional clients across fixed-income, credit, currency, commodity and equity businesses. Global
Markets provides market-making, financing, securities clearing, settlement and custody services
globally to institutional investor clients in support of their investing and trading activities.
Global Markets product coverage includes securities and derivative products in both the primary and
secondary markets. Global Markets also works with commercial and corporate clients to provide risk
management products. As a result of market-making activities, Global Markets may be required to
manage risk in a broad range of financial products. In addition, the economics of certain investment
banking and underwriting activities are shared primarily between Global Markets and Global Banking
under an internal revenue-sharing arrangement. All Other All Other primarily consists of ALM
activities, liquidating businesses and certain expenses not otherwise allocated to a business
segment. ALM activities encompass interest rate and foreign currency risk management activities for
which substantially all of the results are allocated to the business segments. All Other includes
income tax benefit adjustments to eliminate the FTE treatment of certain tax credits recorded in
Global Banking and Global Markets . Basis of Presentation The management accounting and reporting
process derives segment and business results by utilizing allocation methodologies for revenue and
expense. The net income derived for the businesses is dependent upon revenue and cost allocations
using an activity-based costing model, funds transfer pricing, and other methodologies and
assumptions management believes are appropriate to reflect the results of the business. Total
revenue, net of interest expense, includes net interest income on an FTE basis and noninterest
income. The adjustment of net interest income to an FTE basis results in a corresponding increase in
income tax expense. The segment results also reflect certain revenue and expense methodologies that
are utilized to determine net income. The net interest income of the businesses includes the results
of a funds transfer pricing process that matches assets and liabilities with similar interest rate
sensitivity and maturity characteristics. In segments where the total of liabilities and equity
exceeds assets, which are generally deposit-taking segments, the Corporation allocates assets to
match liabilities. Net interest income of the business segments also includes an allocation of net
interest income generated by certain of the Corporation’s ALM activities. The Corporation’s ALM
activities include an overall interest rate risk management strategy that incorporates the use of
various derivatives and cash instruments to manage fluctuations in earnings and capital that are
caused by interest rate volatility. The Corporation’s goal is to manage interest rate sensitivity so
that movements in interest rates do not significantly adversely affect earnings and capital. The
results of a majority of the Corporation’s ALM activities are allocated to the business segments and
fluctuate based on the performance of the ALM activities. ALM activities include external product
pricing decisions including deposit pricing strategies, the effects of the Corporation’s internal
funds transfer pricing process and the net effects of other ALM activities. The segment noninterest
expenses consist of the same expenses as those shown in the Consolidated Statement of Income and
contain both direct expenses and certain expenses not directly attributable to a specific business
segment, including indirect compensation and benefits expenses, that are allocated to the segments.
The costs of certain centralized or shared functions are allocated based on methodologies that
reflect utilization. The following table presents net income (loss) and the components thereto (with
net interest income on an FTE basis for the business segments, All Other and the total Corporation)
for 2024, 2023 and 2022, and total assets at December 31, 2024 and 2023 for each business segment, as
well as All Other.

NOTE 25 Performance by Geographical Area
The Corporation’s operations are highly integrated with operations in both U.S. and non-U.S. markets.
The non-U.S. business activities are largely conducted in Europe, the Middle East and Africa and in
Asia. The Corporation identifies its geographic performance based on the business unit structure used
to manage the capital or expense deployed in the region
as applicable. This requires certain judgments related to the allocation of revenue so that revenue
can be appropriately matched with the related capital or expense deployed in the region. Certain
asset, liability, income and expense amounts have been allocated to arrive at total assets, total
revenue, net of interest expense, income before income taxes and net income by geographic area as
presented below.

 Bank of America168 
 Glossary 
Alt-A Mortgage – A type of U.S. mortgage that is
considered riskier than A-paper, or “prime,” and
less risky than “subprime,” the riskiest
category. Typically, Alt-A mortgages are
characterized by borrowers with less than full
documentation, lower credit scores and higher
LTVs.
Assets Under Management (AUM) – The total market
value of assets under the investment advisory
and/or discretion of GWIM which generate asset
management fees based on a percentage of the
assets’ market values. AUM reflects assets that
are generally managed for institutional, high net
worth and retail clients, and are distributed
through various investment products including
mutual funds, other commingled vehicles and
separate accounts.
Banking Book – All on- and off-balance sheet
financial instruments of the Corporation except
for those positions that are held for trading
purposes.
Brokerage and Other Assets – Non-discretionary
client assets which are held in brokerage
accounts or held for safekeeping.
Committed Credit Exposure – Any funded portion of
a facility plus the unfunded portion of a
facility on which the lender is legally bound to
advance funds during a specified period under
prescribed conditions.
Credit Derivatives – Contractual agreements that
provide protection against a specified credit
event on one or more referenced obligations.
Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) – A portfolio
adjustment required to properly reflect the
counterparty credit risk exposure as part of the
fair value of derivative instruments.
Debit Valuation Adjustment (DVA) – A portfolio
adjustment required to properly reflect the
Corporation’s own credit risk exposure as part of
the fair value of derivative instruments and/or
structured liabilities.
Funding Valuation Adjustment (FVA) – A portfolio
adjustment required to include funding costs on
uncollateralized derivatives and derivatives
where the Corporation is not permitted to use the
collateral it receives.
Interest Rate Lock Commitment (IRLC) – Commitment
with a loan applicant in which the loan terms are
guaranteed for a designated period of time
subject to credit approval.
Letter of Credit – A document issued on behalf of
a customer to a third party promising to pay the
third party upon presentation of specified
documents. A letter of credit effectively
substitutes the issuer’s credit for that of the
customer.
Loan-to-value (LTV) – A commonly used credit
quality metric. LTV is calculated as the
outstanding carrying value of the loan divided by
the estimated value of the property securing the
loan.
Macro Products – Include currencies, interest
rates and commodities products.
Margin Receivable – An extension of credit
secured by eligible securities in certain
brokerage accounts.
Matched Book – Repurchase and resale agreements
or securities borrowed and loaned transactions
where the overall asset and liability position is
similar in size and/or maturity. Generally, these
are entered into to accommodate customers where
the Corporation earns the interest rate spread.
Mortgage Servicing Right (MSR) – The right to
service a mortgage loan when the underlying loan
is sold or securitized. Servicing includes
collections for principal, interest and escrow
payments from borrowers and accounting for and
remitting principal and interest payments to
investors.
Nonperforming Loans and Leases – Includes loans
and leases that have been placed on nonaccrual
status, including nonaccruing loans whose
contractual terms have been restructured in a
manner that grants a concession to a borrower
experiencing financial difficulties.
Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) – A framework
established by the U.S. banking regulators
requiring banks to maintain certain levels of
regulatory capital ratios, comprised of five
categories of capitalization: “well capitalized,”
“adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,”
“significantly undercapitalized” and “critically
undercapitalized.” Insured depository
institutions that fail to meet certain of these
capital levels are subject to increasingly strict
limits on their activities, including their
ability to make capital distributions, pay
management compensation, grow assets and take
other actions.
Subprime Loans – Although a standard industry
definition for subprime loans (including subprime
mortgage loans) does not exist, the Corporation
defines subprime loans as specific product
offerings for higher risk borrowers.
Value-at-Risk (VaR) – VaR is a model that
simulates the value of a portfolio under a range
of hypothetical scenarios in order to generate a
distribution of potential gains and losses. VaR
represents the loss the portfolio is expected to
experience with a given confidence level based on
historical data. A VaR model is an effective tool
in estimating ranges of potential gains and
losses on our trading portfolios.
