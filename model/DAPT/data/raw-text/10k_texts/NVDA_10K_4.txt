 Our Company 
NVIDIA pioneered accelerated computing to help solve the most challenging computational problems.
Since our original focus on PC graphics, we have expanded to several other large and important
computationally intensive fields. Fueled by the sustained demand for exceptional 3D graphics and the
scale of the gaming market, NVIDIA has leveraged its GPU architecture to create platforms for
scientific computing, artificial intelligence, or AI, data science, autonomous vehicles, or AV,
robotics, and augmented and virtual reality, or AR and VR.
The GPU was initially used to simulate human imagination, enabling the virtual worlds of video games
and films. Today, it also simulates human intelligence, enabling a deeper understanding of the
physical world. Its parallel processing capabilities, supported by thousands of computing cores, are
essential to running deep learning algorithms. This form of AI, in which software writes itself by
learning from large amounts of data, can serve as the brain of computers, robots and self-driving
cars that can perceive and understand the world. GPU-powered deep learning is being adopted by
thousands of enterprises to deliver services and products that would have been impossible with
traditional coding.
NVIDIA has a platform strategy, bringing together hardware and systems, software, algorithms and
libraries, and services to create unique value for the markets we serve. While the computing
requirements of these end markets are diverse, we address them with a unified underlying architecture
leveraging our GPUs and software stacks. The programmable nature of our architecture allows us to
support several multi-billion-dollar end markets with the same underlying technology by using a
variety of software stacks developed either internally or by third party developers and partners. The
large and growing number of developers across our platforms strengthens our ecosystem and increases
the value of our platform to our customers.
Innovation is at our core. We have invested over $29 billion in research and development since our
inception, yielding inventions that are essential to modern computing. Our invention of the GPU in
1999 defined modern computer graphics and established NVIDIA as the leader in computer graphics. With
our introduction of the CUDA programming model in 2006, we opened the parallel processing
capabilities of our GPU for general purpose computing. This approach significantly accelerates the
most demanding high-performance computing, or HPC, applications in fields such as aerospace, bio-
science research, mechanical and fluid simulations, and energy exploration. Today, our GPUs and
networking accelerate many of the fastest supercomputers across the world. In addition, the massively
parallel compute architecture of our GPUs and associated software are well suited for deep learning
and machine learning, powering the era of AI. While traditional CPU-based approaches no longer
deliver advances on the pace described by Moore’s Law, we deliver GPU performance improvements on a
pace ahead of Moore’s Law, giving the industry a path forward.
Gamers choose NVIDIA GPUs to enjoy immersive, increasingly cinematic virtual worlds. GPUs also help
underpin the world’s fastest growing spectator sport, eSports, which attracts hundreds of millions of
viewers to watch top-quality gaming. In addition to serving the growing number of gamers, the market
for gaming GPUs is expanding as a result of the burgeoning population of live streamers,
broadcasters, artists and creators.
Researchers use our GPUs to accelerate a wide range of important applications, from simulating
molecular dynamics to climate forecasting. With support for more than 2,500 applications - including
the top 15 HPC applications - NVIDIA GPUs enable some of the most promising areas of discovery, from
climate prediction to materials science and from wind tunnel simulation to genomics. Including GPUs
and networking, NVIDIA powers over 70%, and 8 of the top 10, supercomputers on the global TOP500

innovation and continuous development, enabling cars to receive over-the-air updates to add new
features and capabilities throughout the life of a vehicle.
 Business Strategies 
NVIDIA’s key strategies that shape our overall business approach include:
Advancing the NVIDIA accelerated computing platform. NVIDIA’s accelerated computing platform can
solve complex problems in significantly less time and with lower power consumption than alternative
computational approaches. Indeed, it can help solve problems that were previously deemed unsolvable.
We work to deliver continued performance leaps that outpace Moore’s Law by leveraging innovation
across the architecture, chip design, system, and software layers. With our acquisition of Mellanox,
we strengthened our end-to-end expertise in data center architectures, positioning us for a future
when the data center is the new unit of computing. This full-stack innovation approach allows us to
deliver order-of-magnitude performance advantages relative to legacy approaches in our target
markets, which include Gaming, Data Center, Professional Visualization, and Automotive. While the
computing requirements of these end markets are diverse, we address them with a unified underlying
architecture leveraging our GPUs and CUDA as the fundamental building blocks. The programmable nature
of our architecture allows us to make leveraged investments in R&D: we can support several multi-
billion-dollar end markets with the same underlying technology by using a variety of software stacks
developed either internally or by third party developers and partners. We utilize this platform
approach in each of our target markets.
Extending our technology and platform leadership in AI. We provide a complete, end-to-end accelerated
computing platform for deep learning and machine learning, addressing both training and inferencing.
This includes GPUs, interconnects, systems, our CUDA programming language, algorithms, libraries, and
other software. GPUs are uniquely suited to AI, and we will continue to add AI-specific features to
our GPU architecture to further extend our leadership
 7 
 Table of Contents 
position. Our AI technology leadership is reinforced by our large and expanding ecosystem in a
virtuous cycle. Our GPU platforms are available from virtually every major server maker and cloud
service provider, as well as on our own AI supercomputer. There are almost 3 million developers
worldwide using CUDA and our other software tools to help deploy our technology in our target
markets. We evangelize AI through partnerships with hundreds of universities and almost 10,000
startups through our Inception program. Additionally, our Deep Learning Institute provides
instruction on the latest techniques on how to design, train, and deploy neural networks in
applications using our accelerated computing platform.
Extending our technology and platform leadership in computer graphics. We believe that computer
graphics is fundamental to the continued expansion and evolution of computing. We apply our research
and development resources to enhance the user experience for consumer entertainment and professional
visualization applications, and create new virtual world and simulation capabilities. Our
technologies are instrumental in driving gaming forward, as developers leverage our libraries and
algorithms to deliver an optimized gaming experience on our GeForce platform. Our computer graphics
platforms leverage not only our industry-leading GeForce and NVIDIA RTX GPUs, but also optimized
software stacks. For example, GeForce Experience enhances each gamer’s experience by optimizing their
PC’s settings, as well as enabling the recording and sharing of gameplay. Our Studio drivers enhance
and accelerate a number of popular creative applications. Omniverse is real-time 3D design
collaboration and virtual world simulation software that empowers artists, designers and creators to
connect and collaborate in leading design applications. We also enable interactive graphics
applications - such as games, movie and photo editing and design software - to be accessed by almost
any device, almost anywhere, through our cloud platforms such as vGPU for enterprise and GeForce NOW
for gaming.
Advancing the leading autonomous vehicle platform. We believe the advent of AV will soon
revolutionize the transportation industry. In our view, AI is the key technology enabler of this
opportunity, as the algorithms required for autonomous driving - such as perception, localization,
and planning - are too complex for legacy hand-coded approaches and will run on multiple trained
neural networks instead. Therefore, we provide a full functionally safe AI-based hardware and
software solution for the AV market under the DRIVE brand, which we are bringing to market through
our partnerships with automotive original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, tier-1 suppliers, and
start-ups. Our AV solution also includes the GPU-based hardware required to train the neural networks
before their in-vehicle deployment, as well as to re-simulate their operation prior to any over-the-
air software updates. We believe our comprehensive, top-to-bottom and end-to-end approach will enable
the transportation industry to solve the complex problems arising from the shift to autonomous
driving.
Leveraging our intellectual property, or IP. We believe our IP is a valuable asset that can be
accessed by our customers and partners through license and development agreements when they desire to
build such capabilities directly into their own products, or have us do so through a custom
development. Such license and development arrangements can further enhance the reach of our
technology.
 Sales and Marketing 
Our worldwide sales and marketing strategy is key to achieving our objective of providing markets
with our high-performance and efficient computing platforms and software. Our sales and marketing
teams, located across our global markets, work closely with end customers and various industry
ecosystems through our partner network. Our partner network incorporates each industry's respective
OEMs, original device manufacturers, or ODMs, system builders, add-in board manufacturers, or AIBs,
retailers/distributors, ISVs, internet and cloud service providers, automotive manufacturers and
tier-1 automotive suppliers, mapping companies, start-ups, and other ecosystem participants.
Members of our sales team have technical expertise and product and industry knowledge. We also employ
a team of application engineers and solution architects to assist our partner network in designing,
testing, and qualifying system designs that incorporate our platforms. We believe that the depth and
quality of our design support are key to improving our partner network’s time-to-market, maintaining
a high level of customer satisfaction, and fostering relationships that encourage our end customers
and partner network to use the next generation of our products within each platform.
To encourage the development of applications optimized for our platforms and software, we seek to
establish and maintain strong relationships in the software development community. Engineering and
marketing personnel engage with key software developers to promote and discuss our platforms, as well
as to ascertain individual product requirements and solve technical problems. Our developer program
makes our products available to developers prior to launch in order to encourage the development of
AI frameworks, SDKs, and APIs for software applications and game titles that are optimized for our
platforms. Our Deep Learning Institute provides in-person and online training for developers in

 Table of Contents 
As NVIDIA’s business has evolved from a focus primarily on gaming products to broader markets, and
from chips to platforms and complete systems to software, so, too, have our avenues to market. Thus,
in addition to sales to customers in our partner network, certain of our platforms are also sold
through e-tail channels, or direct to cloud service providers and enterprise customers.
 Seasonality 
Our computing platforms serve a diverse set of markets such as consumer gaming, enterprise and cloud
data centers, professional workstations, and automotive. Our consumer products typically see stronger
revenue in the second half of our fiscal year. In addition, based on the production schedules of key
customers, some of our products for notebooks and game consoles typically generate stronger revenue
in the second and third quarters, and weaker revenue in the fourth and first quarters. In fiscal year
2022, our demand exceeded our supply in several areas, and our revenue did not follow historical
seasonal patterns. However, there can be no assurance that these trends will continue. Our fiscal
year 2022 supply-constrained environment or historical seasonality trends may not repeat.
 Manufacturing 
We do not manufacture semiconductors used for our products. Instead, we utilize a fabless
manufacturing strategy, whereby we employ world-class suppliers for all phases of the manufacturing
process, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing, and packaging. This strategy uses the
expertise of industry-leading suppliers that are certified by the International Organization for
Standardization in such areas as fabrication, assembly, quality control and assurance, reliability,
and testing. Additionally, we can avoid many of the significant costs and risks associated with
owning and operating manufacturing operations. While we may directly procure certain raw materials
used in the production of our products, such as substrates and a variety of components, our suppliers
are responsible for procurement of most of the raw materials used in the production of our products.
As a result, we can focus our resources on product design, additional quality assurance, marketing,
and customer support. We have placed non-cancellable inventory orders for certain products in advance
of our historical lead times, paid premiums and provided deposits to secure future supply and
capacity and may need to continue to do so in the future.
We utilize industry-leading suppliers, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited and
Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd, to produce our semiconductor wafers. We then utilize independent
subcontractors, such as Amkor Technology, King Yuan Electronics Co., Ltd., Omni Logistics, LLC,
Siliconware Precision Industries Company Ltd., and Wistron Corporation to perform assembly, testing,
and packaging of most of our products and platforms. We use contract manufacturers such as Flex Ltd.,
Jabil Inc., and Universal Scientific Industrial Co., Ltd., to manufacture our standard and custom
adapter card products and switch systems, and Fabrinet to manufacture our cables. We purchase
substrates from Ibiden Co. Ltd., Kinsus Interconnect Technology Corporation, and Unimicron Technology
Corporation, and memory from Micron Technology, Samsung Semiconductor, Inc., or Samsung, and SK
Hynix. We often consign key components or materials such as the GPU, SoC, memory, and integrated
circuit to the contract manufacturers.
We typically receive semiconductor products from our subcontractors, perform incoming quality
assurance and configuration using test equipment purchased from industry-leading suppliers such as
Advantest America Inc., and then ship the semiconductors to contract manufacturers, such as BYD Auto
Co. Ltd. and Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., distributors, motherboard and add-in card, or AIC,
customers from our third-party warehouses in Hong Kong, Israel, and the United States. Generally,
these manufacturers assemble and test the boards based on our design kit and test specifications, and
then ship our products to retailers, system builders, or OEMs as motherboard and AIC solutions.
 Competition 
The market for our products is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological
change and evolving industry standards. We believe that the principal competitive factors in this
market are performance, breadth of product offerings, access to customers and partners and
distribution channels, software support, conformity to industry standard APIs, manufacturing
capabilities, processor pricing, and total system costs. We believe that our ability to remain
competitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and functions that
customers and partners will demand and whether we are able to deliver consistent volumes of our
products at acceptable levels of quality and at competitive prices. We expect competition to increase
from both existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be lower priced than
ours or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by our products. In
addition, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire
significant market share.
A significant source of competition comes from companies that provide or intend to provide GPUs,
embedded SoCs, and other accelerated, AI computing processor products, and providers of
semiconductor-based high-performance interconnect products based on InfiniBand, Ethernet, Fibre
Channel and proprietary technologies. Some of our
 9 
 Table of Contents 
competitors may have greater marketing, financial, distribution and manufacturing resources than we
do and may be more able to adapt to customer or technological changes. We expect an increasingly
competitive environment in the future.
Our current competitors include:
• suppliers and licensors designing discrete and integrated GPUs, custom chips and other accelerated
computing solutions, such as Advanced Micro Devices, or AMD, and Intel Corporation, or Intel;
• large internet services companies with internal teams designing chips that incorporate accelerated
computing functionality as part of their internal solutions or platforms, such as Alibaba Group,
Alphabet, and Amazon;
• suppliers of SoC products that are embedded into automobiles, autonomous machines, and gaming
devices, such as Ambarella, Inc., AMD, Broadcom Inc., Intel, Qualcomm Incorporated, Renesas
Electronics Corporation, and Samsung, or companies with internal teams designing SoC products for

Arista Networks, Broadcom, Cisco, HP, Intel, Juniper Networks, Inc., Lumentum Holdings, and Marvell
Technology Group, as well as internal teams of system vendors and large internet services companies
such as Alphabet and Amazon.
 Patents and Proprietary Rights 
We rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party
nondisclosure agreements, and licensing arrangements to protect our IP in the United States and
internationally. Our currently issued patents have expiration dates from February 2022 to June 2045.
We have numerous patents issued, allowed, and pending in the United States and in foreign
jurisdictions. Our patents and pending patent applications primarily relate to our products and the
technology used in connection with our products. We also rely on international treaties,
organizations, and foreign laws to protect our IP. The laws of certain foreign countries in which our
products are or may be manufactured or sold, including various countries in Asia, may not protect our
products or IP rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. This decreased protection
makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely. We continuously assess
whether and where to seek formal protection for particular innovations and technologies based on such
factors as:
• the location in which our products are manufactured;
• our strategic technology or product directions in different countries;
• the degree to which IP laws exist and are meaningfully enforced in different jurisdictions; and
• the commercial significance of our operations and our competitors' operations in particular
countries and regions.
We have licensed technology from third parties and expect to continue to enter into such license
agreements.
 Government Regulations 
Our worldwide business activities are subject to various laws, rules, and regulations of the United
States as well as of foreign governments. Our acquisitions may be subject to government regulatory
reviews, and the cost to comply with such regulations or costs incurred where regulatory challenges
prevent the completion of an acquisition could have a material impact on our business. On February 8,
2022, we announced the termination of the Share Purchase Agreement by which we would have acquired
Arm due to significant regulatory challenges preventing the completion of the transaction and expect
to incur a $1.36 billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. Compliance with laws,
rules, and regulations has not otherwise had a material effect upon our capital expenditures, results
of operations, or competitive position and we do not currently anticipate material capital
expenditures for environmental control facilities. Compliance with existing or future governmental
regulations, including, but not limited to, those pertaining to IP ownership and infringement, taxes,
import and export requirements and tariffs, anti-corruption, business acquisitions, foreign exchange
controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy requirements, competition and antitrust,
advertising, employment, product regulations, cybersecurity, environmental, health and safety
requirements, the responsible use of AI, climate change, cryptocurrency, and consumer laws, could
increase our costs, impact our competitive position, and otherwise may have a material adverse impact
on our business, financial condition and results of operations in subsequent periods. Refer to “Item
1A. Risk Factors” for a discussion of these potential impacts.

 Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance 
NVIDIA invents computing technologies that improve lives and address global challenges. We integrate
sound environmental, social and corporate governance, or ESG, principles and practices into every
aspect of the Company. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of our Board of Directors is
responsible for reviewing and discussing with management our practices concerning ESG. We undertake
an annual analysis to ensure that our ESG priorities remain aligned with stakeholder expectations,
market trends, and business risks and opportunities. These issues are important for our continued
business success and reflect the topics of highest concern to NVIDIA and our stakeholders.
The following section provides an overview of some of these principles and practices. More
information can be found on the Corporate Social Responsibility section of our website and in our
annual Corporate Social Responsibility Report, or CSR Report. Information contained on our website or
in our annual CSR Report is not incorporated by reference into this or any other report we file with
the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC. Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for a discussion
of risks and uncertainties we face related to ESG.
 Climate Change 
In the area of sustainability, we address our climate impacts across our product lifecycle and assess
risks, including current and emerging regulations and market impacts.
In our CSR Report, we report several metrics related to our environmental impact, our most recent
full reporting year being fiscal year 2021, with our fiscal year 2022 metrics expected to be
published in May 2022. There has been no material impact to capital expenditures, our results of
operations or competitive position associated with global sustainability regulations, compliance, or
costs from sourcing renewable energy. By the end of fiscal year 2025, our goal is to purchase or
generate enough renewable energy to match 100% of our global electricity usage for our offices and
data centers.
Whether it is creation of technology to power next-generation laptops or designs to support high-
performance supercomputers, improving energy efficiency is important in our research, development,
and design processes. GPUs are inherently more energy efficient than other forms of computing because
they are optimized for throughput and performance per watt rather than absolute performance. GPU
servers are approximately 40x more energy efficient than traditional CPU servers for AI workloads.
The power efficiency of our products is evidenced by our continued strong presence on the Green500
list of the most energy-efficient systems. We powered 23 of the top 25 systems on the November 2021
Green500 list.
We plan to build Earth-2, an AI supercomputer dedicated to predicting the impacts of climate change.
The system will build a digital twin of the Earth on our Omniverse platform, enable scientists to do
ultra-high-resolution climate modeling, and put mitigation and adaptation tools into the hands of
cities and nations so they can act with more urgency.
 Human Capital Management 
We believe that our employees are our greatest assets, and they play a key role in creating long-term
value for our stakeholders. As of January 30, 2022, we had 22,473 employees in 32 countries. 16,242
were engaged in research and development and 6,231 were engaged in sales, marketing, operations, and
administrative positions.
To be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully, we must recruit, develop, and
retain talented employees, including qualified executives, scientists, engineers, and technical and
non-technical staff.
 Recruitment 
The demand for talent in new markets such as AI and deep learning, is increasingly competitive. With
differentiated hiring strategies for university, professional, executive, and for diversity, we have
been successful in attracting top talent to NVIDIA.
We attract global talent from universities, collaborations with college programs, professional
organization affiliations, industry conferences, community resource group participation, direct
sourcing and outreach. Our employees play an important part in recruiting, with over 39% of our new
hires coming from employee referrals.
 Development and Retention 
To support employee advancement, we provide opportunities to learn on-the-job through training
programs, one on one coaching and ongoing feedback. We have a rich library of live and on-demand
learning experiences that include workshops, panel discussions, and speaker forums. We curate
learning paths focused on our most common
 11 
 Table of Contents 
development needs and constantly upgrade our offerings to ensure that our employees are exposed to
the most current programs and technologies available. We offer tuition reimbursement programs to
subsidize educational programs and advanced certifications. We encourage internal mobility through
career coaching that advises employees on developmental activities and pursuing internal transfer
opportunities. We have implemented specifically designed mentoring and development programs for women
and employees from traditionally underrepresented groups to ensure widespread readiness for future
advancement.
To evaluate employee sentiment and engagement, we use pulse surveys, a suggestion box, and an
anonymous third-party platform. Pulse surveys help us gain insight into employee experience and
provide ideas so that we can prioritize areas to take action. The suggestion box is an always-on,
interactive tool where employees share their thoughts about making our company a better place to
work. The anonymous third-party platform is designed to protect the identity of the reporter and
provide a mechanism for reporters to follow an investigation and receive responses.
In fiscal year 2022, our overall turnover rate was 4.9%.
 Compensation, Benefits, and Well-Being 
Our compensation program rewards performance and is structured to encourage employees to invest in
the Company’s future. Employees receive equity, except where unavailable due to local regulations,
that is tied to the value of our stock price and vests over time to retain employees while
simultaneously aligning their interests with those of our stockholders.
We offer comprehensive benefits to support our employees’ and their families’ physical health, well-
being and financial health, including 401(k) programs in the U.S., statutory pension programs outside
the U.S., our employee stock purchase program, flexible work hours and time off, and programs to
address mental health, stress, and time-management challenges. We evaluate our benefit offerings
globally and are committed to providing tailored benefits based on community needs, including
assistance for military members, additional mental health benefits, and support for new birth
parents, and those who wish to become parents.
 Diversity and Inclusion 
We believe that diverse teams fuel innovation, and we are committed to creating an inclusive culture
that supports all employees, regardless of gender, gender identity or expression, veteran status,
race, ethnicity, or ability.
We have increased our efforts to recruit, develop, and retain a more diverse workforce with a focus
on those historically underrepresented in the technology field, including women, Black/African
American, and Hispanic/Latino candidates.
Other efforts we have been or are undertaking include:
• Expanded recruiting teams and deepened our college pipeline to engage more diverse students and
partnering with minority-serving institutions and professional organizations;
• Supported the development of women employees to build a pipeline of future leaders;
• Supported underrepresented employees through our 11 internal community resource groups;
• Providing training and education to managers and peers on how to foster a supportive environment;
and
• Measuring year over year progress and providing leadership visibility on diversity efforts.
As of January 30, 2022, our global workforce was 80% male, 19% female, and 1% not declared and 6% of
our workforce in the United States was composed of Black or African American and Hispanic or Latino
employees.
 Health and COVID-19 
We support our people and their families in making their health and safety a top priority. During
fiscal year 2022 and the COVID-19 pandemic, we continued our global protocols to keep our workforce
safe. For essential labs and offices that remain open, we maintained appropriate safety protocols and
social distancing guidelines. We have also made some of our offices accessible based on a clearly
defined set of metrics while adhering to government guidelines. Steps we took to support employees
include:
• Providing work from home support, including reimbursement for home office equipment and certain
work from home expenses;
 12 
 Table of Contents 
• Enhanced health coverage, including-COVID-19 testing, vaccine costs and support, expanded mental
health resources and virtual care offerings, and care for those with COVID-19;
• Learning and development resources on how to lead and manage remotely; and
• Opportunities for employees to socially connect with one another virtually.
We will continue a flexible work environment and have instituted Company-wide “rest days” for
employees to recharge.

│ ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS │
In evaluating NVIDIA, the following risk factors should be considered in addition to the other
information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Purchasing or owning NVIDIA common stock involves
investment risks including, but not limited to, the risks described below. Any one of the following
risks could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation, which could
cause our stock price to decline, and you may lose all or a part of your investment. Additional
risks, trends and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial
may also harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation.
 Risks Related to Our Industry and Markets 
If we fail to meet the evolving needs of our markets, or to identify new products, services or
technologies, our revenue and financial results may be adversely impacted.
Our accelerated computing platforms address four large markets: Gaming, Data Center, Professional
Visualization, and Automotive. These markets experience rapid changes in technology, customer
requirements, new product introductions and enhancements, and industry standards.
Our strategic and business success depends on our ability to:
• timely identify emerging industry changes, and develop new or enhance existing products, services
and technologies that meet the evolving needs of these markets;
• expand the ecosystem for our products and technologies;
• accurately forecast demand in our businesses;
• meet customer safety and compliance standards, which are subject to change;
• manage product, software, and service lifecycles to maintain customer and end user satisfaction;
• develop infrastructure needed to scale our business, including related to our acquisitions,
customer support, e-commerce and IP licensing capabilities; and
• complete technical, financial, compliance, sales and marketing investments for some of the above
activities.
We make considerable investments in research and development and business offerings in markets where
we have a limited operating history, which may not produce meaningful revenue for several years, if
at all. If we fail to develop new products, services and technologies, or if they do not become
widely adopted, our business, revenue, financial condition and results of operations could be
adversely affected.
Achieving design wins, which is important to our success in several businesses, may involve a lengthy
process and depend on our ability to anticipate features and functionality that customers will
demand. Unanticipated changes in industry standards or disruptive technological innovation could
render our products incompatible with products developed by other companies. If our products are not
in compliance with prevailing industry and safety standards, our customers may not incorporate our
products into their design strategies. Failure to obtain a particular design win may prevent us from
obtaining future design wins in subsequent generations. Furthermore, a design win does not guarantee
revenue.
We cannot ensure that our strategic direction will result in products and technologies that provide
value to our customers and partners. If we fail to anticipate the changing needs of our target
markets and emerging technology trends, or if we do not appropriately adapt our strategies as market
conditions evolve, our business will be harmed.
 14 
 Table of Contents 
Competition in our current and target markets could prevent us from growing our revenue.
Our target markets remain competitive, and competition may intensify with expanding and changing
product and service offerings, industry standards, customer needs, new entrants and consolidations.
Our competitors’ products, services and technologies, such as the high-end discrete GPUs offered by
Intel and AMD, may be cheaper or provide better functionality or features than ours, which may result
in lower than expected selling prices for our products. Some of our competitors operate their own
fabrication facilities, have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, more comprehensive IP
portfolios and patent protections, new designs and more design wins, and greater financial, sales,
marketing and distribution resources than we do. These competitors may be able to more effectively
identify and capitalize upon opportunities in new markets and end user customer trends, more quickly
transition their products, and secure sufficient foundry capacity and packaging materials during a
supply-constrained environment, which could harm our business. In our networking business, some of
our customers are also integrated circuit and switch suppliers and have in-house expertise and
internal development capabilities similar to ours. Licensing our technology and supporting such
customers entails the transfer of IP rights that may enable such customers to develop their own
solutions to replace those we are providing. If we are unable to successfully compete and respond to
changes in our target markets or introduce new offerings to meet the needs of this competitive
environment, demand for our products, services and technologies could decrease, which would cause our
revenue to decline.
 Risks Related to Demand, Supply and Manufacturing 
If we fail to estimate customer demand properly, there may be a mismatch between supply and demand,
and our financial results could be harmed.
Demand for our products is based on many factors, including our product introductions and
transitions, time to market, competitor product releases and announcements, competing technologies,
and other factors, all of which can impact the timing and volume of our revenue. We sell many of our
products through channel partners, who sell to retailers, distributors, and/or end customers. As a
result, the decisions made by our channel partners, retailers and distributors in response to
changing market conditions and demand for our products could impact our ability to properly forecast
demand.
GPUs have use cases in addition to their designed and marketed use case, such as for digital currency
mining, including blockchain-based platforms such as Ethereum. It is difficult for us to estimate
with any reasonable degree of precision the past or current impact of cryptocurrency mining, or
forecast the future impact of cryptocurrency mining, on demand for our products. Volatility in the
cryptocurrency market, including new compute technologies, price changes in cryptocurrencies,
government cryptocurrency policies and regulations, new cryptocurrency standards, and changes in the
method of verifying blockchain transactions, have impacted and can in the future impact
cryptocurrency mining and demand for our products, and can further impact our ability to estimate
demand for our products. Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not limited
to, the pending Ethereum 2.0 standard may decrease the usage of GPUs for Ethereum mining as well as
create increased aftermarket resales of our GPUs, impact retail prices for our GPUs, increase returns
of our products in the distribution channel, and may reduce demand for our new GPUs. We have
introduced Lite Hash Rate, or LHR, GeForce GPUs with limited Ethereum mining capability and increased
the supply of CMP in an effort to address demand from gamers and direct miners to CMP. However, if
attempts in the aftermarket to improve the hash rate capabilities of our LHR cards are successful,
our gaming cards may become more attractive to miners, increasing demand for our gaming GPUs and
limiting our ability to supply our gaming cards to non-mining customers. We cannot predict whether
our strategy of using LHR cards and CMP will achieve our desired outcome. In addition, our products
may be resold on the unauthorized “gray market,” which also makes demand forecasting difficult. Gray
market products compete with our distribution channels.
Consumer and enterprise behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as increased demand for our
Gaming, Data Center, and workstation products, has made it more difficult for us to estimate future
demand. These challenges may continue in the future when the effects of the pandemic subside.
Our manufacturing lead times are very long and in some cases, extend to be twelve months or longer,
which requires us to make estimates of customers’ future demand. We have revised our process for
purchasing supply as a result of the worldwide supply shortages impacting the semiconductor industry.
Our inventory and purchase commitments reflect our demand expectations for our future quarters and
long-term supply and capacity needs. These conditions could lead to a significant mismatch between
supply and demand, giving rise to product shortages or excess inventory. Demand for our products may
be perishable or may disappear, which would make our demand forecast more uncertain and cause us to
lose market share, perhaps permanently. To shorten shipment lead times, we may build finished
products and carry inventory for anticipated demand that does not materialize. We may not be able to
reduce our inventory purchase commitments if customers cancel or defer orders or choose to purchase
from our competitors. We may write-down our
 15 
 Table of Contents 
inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or excess inventory, and we could experience a
reduction in average selling prices if we incorrectly forecast product demand.
Situations that may result in excess inventory or related impairments include:
• changes in business and economic conditions resulting in decreased consumer confidence, including
downturns in our target markets and/or overall economy and changes in the credit market;
• higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology or customer
requirements;
• new product introductions resulting in less demand for existing products or inconsistent spikes in
demand due to unexpected end use cases;
• increase in demand for competitive products, including competitive actions;
• fluctuations in demand for our products related to cryptocurrency mining; or
• decrease in future demand, decrease in the cost of supply chain materials, or changes in the design
of future products where we have entered into long-term supply commitments, including prepayments,
particularly to the extent we are placing orders well in advance of our historical lead times and/or
before the design of those products is final.
Conversely, if we underestimate our customers' demand for our products, our foundry partners may not
have adequate lead-time or capacity to increase production and we may not be able to obtain
sufficient inventory to fill orders on a timely basis. We may also face supply constraints caused by
natural disasters or other events. If we are able to increase production levels to meet customer
demand, we may not be able to do so in a cost-effective or timely manner. If we fail to fulfill our
customers’ orders on a timely basis, or at all, our customer relationships could be damaged, we could
lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be damaged.
In periods of shortages impacting the semiconductor industry and/or limited supply or capacity in our
supply chain, as we are in today, we have placed and may continue to place non-cancellable inventory
orders in advance of our historical lead times, and pay premiums and/or provide deposits to secure
future supply and capacity. For example, while we previously placed orders with approximately six
months’ lead time, we have begun placing orders at least twelve months in advance. Our inventory and
purchase commitments reflect our demand expectations for our future quarters and long-term supply and
capacity needs. However, we may not be able to accurately predict when such periods of shortage will
end, nor do we know whether those inventory orders accurately address our current and future demand
needs. These actions may increase our product costs and trigger significant excess inventory or other
charges if there is a partial or complete reduction in long-term demand for our products or if such
demand is served by our competitors, which could negatively impact our gross margins and our overall
financial results.
We depend on third parties and their technology to manufacture, assemble, test, package or design our
products, which reduces our control over product quantity and quality, manufacturing yields,
development, enhancement and product delivery schedule and could harm our business.
We do not manufacture the semiconductors used for our products and do not own or operate a wafer
fabrication facility. We depend on foundries to manufacture our semiconductor wafers using their
fabrication equipment and techniques. We do not assemble, test or package our products, but instead
contract with independent subcontractors. We also rely on third-party software development tools to
assist us in the design, simulation and verification of new products or product enhancements. The
design requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for greater functionality from our products
may exceed the capabilities of available software development tools. While we may enter into long-
term supply and capacity commitments, we may not be able to secure sufficient commitments for
capacity to address our business needs. We face several risks which could adversely affect our
ability to meet customer demand and scale our supply chain, negatively impact longer-term demand for
our products and services, and adversely affect our business operations, gross margin, revenue and/or
financial results, including:
• lack of guaranteed supply of wafers, components and capacity or decommitment and potential higher
wafer and component prices, from incorrectly estimating demand and failing to place orders with our
suppliers with sufficient quantities or in a timely manner;
• failure by our foundries or contract manufacturers to procure raw materials or to provide adequate
levels of manufacturing or test capacity for our products;
 16 
 Table of Contents 
• failure by our foundries to develop, obtain or successfully implement high quality process
technologies, including transitions to smaller geometry process technologies such as advanced process
node technologies and memory designs needed to manufacture our products;
• limited number of global suppliers, foundries, contract manufacturers, assembly and test providers,
and memory manufacturers;
• loss of a supplier and additional expense and/or production delays as a result of qualifying a new
foundry or subcontractor and commencing volume production or testing in the event of a loss of or a
decision to add or change a supplier;
• lack of direct control over product quantity, quality and delivery schedules;
• delays in product shipments, shortages, a decrease in product quality and/or higher expenses in the
event our subcontractors or foundries prioritize our competitors’ orders over ours; and
• low manufacturing yields resulting from a failure in our product design or a foundry’s proprietary
process technology.
If our products contain significant defects, we could incur significant expenses to remediate such
defects, our reputation could be damaged, and we could lose market share.
Our hardware and software product offerings are complex and may contain defects or security
vulnerabilities, or experience failures or unsatisfactory performance due to any number of issues in
design, fabrication, packaging, materials and/or use within a system. These risks may increase as our
products are introduced into new devices, markets, technologies and applications or as new versions
are released. Some errors in our products or services may only be discovered after a product or
service has been shipped or used. Undiscovered vulnerabilities in our products or services could
expose our end customers to unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy malicious software
programs that could attack our products or services. Defects or failure of our products to perform to
specifications could lead to substantial damage to the products or the product in which our device
has been integrated by OEMs, ODMs, AIBs and Tier 1 automotive suppliers, and to the user of such end
product. Any such defect may cause us to incur significant warranty, support and repair or
replacement costs as part of a product recall or otherwise, write-off the value of related inventory,
and divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts to find
and correct the issue. An error or defect in new products or releases or related software drivers
after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance, loss
of design wins, and harm to our relationships with existing and prospective customers and partners
and consumers’ perceptions of our brand, which would in turn negatively impact our business
operations, gross margin, revenue and/or financial results. We may be required to reimburse our
customers, partners or consumers, including for costs to repair or replace products in the field. If
a product liability claim is brought against us, the cost of defending the claim could be significant
and would divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel and harm our business.
Further, our business liability insurance may be inadequate or future coverage may be unavailable on
acceptable terms, which could adversely impact our financial results.
 Risks Related to Our Global Operating Business 
We are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with international operations, including adverse
economic conditions, which may harm our business.
We conduct our business and have offices worldwide. Our semiconductor wafers are manufactured,
assembled, tested and packaged by third parties located outside of the United States and we generated
84% of our revenue for fiscal year 2022 from sales outside of the United States. The global nature of
our business subjects us to a number of risks and uncertainties, which could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including:
• domestic and international economic and political conditions between countries in which we do
business;
• differing legal standards with respect to protection of IP and employment practices;
• domestic and international business and cultural practices that differ;
• disruptions to capital markets and/or currency fluctuations; and
 17 
 Table of Contents 
• natural disasters, acts of war or other military actions, terrorism, public health issues, and
other catastrophic events.
Adverse changes in global, regional or local economic conditions, including recession or slowing
growth, changes or uncertainty in fiscal, monetary, or trade policy, higher interest rates, tighter
credit, inflation, lower capital expenditures by businesses including on IT infrastructure, increases
in unemployment, and lower consumer confidence and spending, periodically occur. More recently,
increased inflation may impact supply, employee, facilities and infrastructure costs. To the extent
such inflation continues, increases or both, it may reduce our margins and have a material adverse
effect on our financial performance.
Economic and industry uncertainty or changes could have adverse, wide-ranging effects on our business
and financial results, including:
• decrease in demand for our products, services and technologies and those of our customers or
licensees;
• the inability of our suppliers to deliver on their supply commitments to us;
• our customers’ or our licensees’ inability to supply products to customers and/or end users;
• the insolvency of key suppliers, distributors, customers or licensees;
• limits on our ability to forecast operating results and make business decisions;
• difficulties in obtaining capital;
• reduced profitability may also cause some customers to scale back operations, exit businesses,
merge with other manufacturers, or file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations;
• lead to consolidation or strategic alliances among other equipment manufacturers, which could
adversely affect our ability to compete effectively; and
• increased credit and collectability risks, higher borrowing costs or reduced availability of
capital markets, reduced liquidity, adverse impacts on our suppliers, failures of counterparties
including financial institutions and insurers, asset impairments, and declines in the value of our
financial instruments.
We have engineering, sales support operations and manufacturing located in Israel. The State of
Israel and companies with business in Israel have been and could in future be the subject of an
economic boycott. Other countries have and may continue in the future restrict business with the
State of Israel and companies with Israeli operations. Such laws and policies may have adverse effect
on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Climate change may have a long-term impact on our business.
Climate change may have an increasingly adverse impact on our business and those of our customers,
partners and vendors. Water and energy availability and reliability in the communities where we
conduct business is critical. We have facilities in regions that may be vulnerable to the impacts of
extreme weather events. Extreme heat and wind coupled with dry conditions in Northern California may
lead to power safety shut offs due to wildfire risk. These measures can have adverse implications for
our Santa Clara, California headquarter offices and data centers, including impairing the ability of
our employees to work effectively. Climate change, its impact on our supply chain and critical
infrastructure worldwide, and its potential to increase political instability in regions where we,
our customers, partners and our vendors do business, may disrupt our business and may cause us to
experience higher attrition, losses and costs to maintain or resume operations. Although we maintain
a program of insurance coverage for a variety of property, casualty, and other risks, the types and
amounts of insurance we obtain vary depending on availability and cost. Some of our policies have
large deductibles and broad exclusions, and our insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay
a claim. Losses not covered by insurance may be large, which could harm our results of operations and
financial condition.
Our operations, products and services, as well as those of our suppliers and customers, may also be
subject to climate-related laws, regulations and lawsuits. Regulations such as carbon taxes, fuel or
energy taxes, and pollution limits could result in greater direct costs, including costs associated
with changes to manufacturing processes or the procurement of raw materials used in manufacturing
processes, increased levels of capital expenditures to improve facilities and equipment, and higher
compliance and energy costs to reduce emissions, as well as greater indirect costs resulting from our
customers, suppliers or both incurring additional compliance costs that are passed on to us. These
costs and restrictions could harm our business and results of operations by increasing our expenses
or requiring us to alter our
 18 
 Table of Contents 
operations and product design activities. Stakeholder groups may find us insufficiently responsive to
the implications of climate change, and therefore we may face legal action or reputational harm. We
may not achieve our stated goal to source 100% of our global electricity use from renewable energy by
the end of fiscal year 2025, which could harm our reputation, or we may incur additional, unexpected
costs to achieve such a goal. We may also experience contractual disputes due to supply chain delays
arising from climate change-related disruptions, which could result in increased litigation and
costs.
We also face risks related to business trends that may be influenced by climate change concerns. We
may face decreased demand for computationally powerful but energy intensive products, such as our
GPUs, despite their energy efficient design and operation, and/or increased consumer or customer
expectations around the energy efficiency of our products, could negatively impact our business.
We may not be able to realize the potential benefits of business investments or acquisitions, and we
may not be able to successfully integrate acquisition targets, which could hurt our ability to grow
our business, develop new products or sell our products.
We have and may continue to acquire and invest in businesses that offer products, services and
technologies that we believe will help expand or enhance our existing strategic objectives.
Acquisitions or investments involve significant challenges and risks and could impair our ability to
grow our business, develop new products or sell our products and ultimately could have a negative
impact on our financial results. Given that our resources are limited, if we pursue a particular
transaction, we may limit our ability to enter into other transactions that could help us achieve our
strategic objectives. If we are unable to timely complete acquisitions, including due to delays and
challenges in obtaining regulatory approvals, we may be unable to pursue other transactions, we may
not be able to retain critical talent from the target company, technology may evolve and make the
acquisition less attractive, and other changes can take place which could reduce the anticipated
benefits of the transaction and negatively impact our business. For example, on February 8, 2022,
NVIDIA and SoftBank announced the termination of the Share Purchase Agreement whereby NVIDIA would
have acquired Arm from SoftBank. The parties agreed to terminate because of significant regulatory
challenges preventing the completion of the transaction. We intend to record in operating expenses a
$1.36 billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 reflecting the write-off of the
prepayment provided at signing in September 2020. In addition, to the extent that our perceived
ability to consummate acquisitions has been harmed, future acquisitions may be more difficult,
complex or expensive. Further, if we hold investments in publicly traded companies, they could create
volatility in our results and may generate losses up to the value of the investment.
Risks related to acquisitions or strategic investments include, but are not limited to:
• difficulty in integrating the technology, products, or operations and integrating and retaining the
employees of the acquired business;
• diversion of capital and other resources, including management’s attention;
• assumption of liabilities and incurring amortization expenses, impairment charges to goodwill or
write-downs of acquired assets;
• integrating accounting, forecasting and controls, procedures and reporting cycles;
• coordinating and integrating operations, particularly in countries in which we do not currently
operate;
• difficulty in realizing a satisfactory return and uncertainties to realize the benefits of an
acquisition or strategic investment, if at all;
• difficulty or inability in obtaining governmental, regulatory approval or restrictions or other
consents and approvals or financing;
• Stock price impact, fines, fees or reputation harm if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval
for an acquisition or are otherwise unable to close an acquisition;
• legal proceedings initiated as a result of an acquisition or investment;
• potential issuances of debt to finance our acquisitions, resulting in increased debt, increased
interest expense, and compliance with debt covenants or other restrictions;
 19 
 Table of Contents 
• the potential for our acquisitions to result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities;
• the potential variability of the amount and form of any performance-based consideration;
• negative changes in general economic conditions in the regions or the industries in which we or our
target operate;
• potential failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant issues with the assets or
company in which we are investing or are acquiring; and
• impairment of relationships with, or loss of our or our target’s employees, vendors and customers,
as a result of our acquisition or investment.
System security and data protection breaches, as well as cyber-attacks, could disrupt our operations,
reduce our expected revenue and increase our expenses, which could adversely affect our stock price
and damage our reputation.
Security breaches, computer malware, social-engineering attacks, denial-of-service attacks, software
bugs, server malfunctions, software or hardware failures, loss of data or other information
technology assets, and other cyber-attacks are increasingly sophisticated, making it more difficult
to successfully detect, defend against them or implement adequate preventative measures.
For example, on February 23, 2022, we became aware of a security incident involving unauthorized
access to our network by a group of independent criminal threat actors, not affiliated with any
government or political cause. The threat actors obtained NVIDIA network credentials and through
deception, obtained two-factor authentication capability and access to our network. The threat actors
misappropriated certain NVIDIA proprietary information, including NVIDIA source code, and leaked some
of that information online. Upon learning of the security incident, we engaged in remedial and
preventative actions, rotated all NVIDIA network credentials to prevent further unauthorized access,
hardened our network, analyzed the information that the threat actors exfiltrated, and notified law
enforcement and other authorities.
Cyber-attacks, including ransomware attacks by organized criminal threat actors, nation-states, and
nation-state-supported actors, may become more prevalent and severe. Our ability to recover from
ransomware attacks may be limited if our backups have been affected by the attack, or if restoring
from backups is delayed or not feasible.
Threat actors, sophisticated nation-states, and nation-state-supported actors now engage and are
expected to continue to engage in cyber-attacks. Due to increasing geopolitical conflicts, we and the
third parties upon which we rely may be vulnerable to a heightened risk of cyber-attacks.
Furthermore, we rely on products and services provided by third party suppliers to operate certain
critical business systems, including without limitation, cloud-based infrastructure, encryption and
authentication technology, employee email, and other functions, which exposes us to supply-chain
attacks or other business disruptions. We cannot guarantee that third parties and infrastructure in
our supply chain or our partners’ supply chains have not been compromised or that they do not contain
exploitable defects or bugs that could result in a breach of or disruption to our information
technology systems, including our products and services, or the third-party information technology
systems that support our services. Our ability to monitor these third parties’ information security
practices is limited, and these may not have adequate information security measures in place. In
addition, if one of our third-party suppliers suffers a security breach, our response may be limited
or more difficult because we may not have direct access to their systems, logs and other information
related to the security breach.
To defend against cyber-attacks, we must continuously engineer more secure products and enhance
security and reliability features, which is expected to result in increased expenses. We must also
continue to develop our security measures, ensure our suppliers have appropriate security measures in
place, and continue to meet the evolving security requirements of our customers. We may not always be
able to detect vulnerabilities in our security controls, systems or software, including third-party
software we have installed, as such threats and techniques change frequently and may not be detected
until after a security incident has occurred. Further, we may experience delays in developing and
deploying remedial measures designed to address identified vulnerabilities.
Breaches of our security measures, along with reported or perceived vulnerabilities or unapproved
dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or third parties
could expose us and the parties affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, potentially
resulting in litigation and subsequent liability, regulatory inquiries or actions, damage to our
brand and reputation or other harm to our business. If we or a third party we rely on experience a
security incident or are perceived to have experienced a security incident, we may experience adverse
consequences, including government enforcement actions, additional reporting requirements and/or
oversight, restrictions on processing data, litigation, indemnification obligations, reputational
harm, diversion of funds, financial
 20

loss, loss of data, material disruptions in our systems and operations, supply chain, and ability to
produce, sell and distribute our goods and services, and other similar harms. Inability to fulfill
orders, delayed sales, lower margins or lost customers as a result of these disruptions could
adversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation.
Business disruptions could harm our operations, lead to a decline in revenue and increase our costs.
Our worldwide operations could be disrupted by natural disasters and extreme weather conditions,
power or water shortages, telecommunications failures, cloud service provider outages, terrorist
attacks, or acts of violence, political and/or civil unrest, acts of war or other military actions,
epidemics or pandemics and other natural or man-made disasters and catastrophic events. Our corporate
headquarters, a large portion of our current data center capacity, and a portion of our research and
development activities are located in California, and other critical business operations, finished
goods inventory, and some of our suppliers are located in Asia, making our operations vulnerable to
natural disasters such as earthquakes, wildfires, or other business disruptions occurring in these
geographical areas. Catastrophic events can also have an impact on third-party vendors who provide us
critical infrastructure services for IT and research and development systems and personnel.
Geopolitical and domestic political developments and other events beyond our control, can increase
economic volatility globally. Political instability, changes in government or adverse political
developments in or around any of the major countries in which we do business would also likely harm
our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, the invasion by Russia of
Ukraine has had and will likely continue to have a negative impact on our employees or operations
both within and outside these regions, and may result in the loss of some or even all of our assets
in those regions. Our operations could be harmed and our costs could increase if manufacturing,
logistics or other operations are disrupted for any reason, including natural disasters, high heat
events or water shortages, information technology system failures, military actions or economic,
business, labor, environmental, public health, or political issues. For example, our operations could
be harmed, and our costs could increase, if the conflict between Russia and Ukraine results in a
shortage of key materials that our suppliers, including our foundry partners, require to satisfy our
needs. The ultimate impact on us, our third-party foundries and other suppliers of being located and
consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown. In the event a disaster, war or catastrophic
event affects us or the third-party systems on which we rely, our business could be harmed as a
result of declines in revenue, increases in expenses, and substantial expenditures and time spent to
fully resume operations. All of these risks and conditions could materially adversely affect our
future sales and operating results.
We receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers and our revenue
could be adversely affected if we lose or are prevented from selling to any of these customers.
We receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers within our
distribution and partner network. With several of these distributors and partners, we are selling
multiple target market platforms through their channels. Our operating results depend on sales within
our partner network, as well as the ability of these partners to sell products that incorporate our
processors. In the future, these partners may decide to purchase fewer products, not to incorporate
our products into their ecosystem, or to alter their purchasing patterns in some other way. Because
most of our sales are made on a purchase order basis, our customers can cancel, change or delay
product purchase commitments with little or no notice to us and without penalty. Our partners or
customers may develop their own solutions; our customers may purchase products from our competitors;
and our partners may discontinue sales or lose market share in the markets for which they purchase
our products, all of which may alter partners’ or customers’ purchasing patterns. The loss of any of
our large customers, a significant reduction in purchases by them, our inability to sell to a
customer due to U.S. trade restrictions, or any difficulties in collecting accounts receivable would
likely harm our financial condition and results of operations.
If we are unable to attract, retain and motivate our executives and key employees, our business may
be harmed.
To be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully, we must attract, retain and
motivate our executives and key employees and recruit and develop diverse talent. Labor is subject to
external factors that are beyond our control, including our industry’s highly competitive market for
skilled workers and leaders, cost inflation, the COVID-19 pandemic and workforce participation rates.
We also must recruit and develop diverse talent. Changes in immigration and work permit regulations
or in their administration or interpretation could impair our ability to attract and retain qualified
employees. If we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain key employees,
our business may be adversely affected. Competition for personnel results in increased costs in the
form of cash and stock-based compensation. We also must retain the key personnel hired as a result of
our acquisitions, or it could reduce the anticipated benefits of those transactions. We are highly
dependent on the services of our longstanding executive team. Failure to ensure effective succession
planning, transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving executives and key employees could
hinder our strategic planning and execution and long-term success.
 21 
 Table of Contents 
Our business is dependent upon the proper functioning of our business processes and information
systems and modification or interruption of such systems may disrupt our business, processes and
internal controls.
We rely upon internal processes and information systems to support key business functions, including
our assessment of internal controls over financial reporting as required by Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The efficient operation of these processes and systems is critical and they need
to be scalable to support our growth, including for acquisitions of other businesses. We expect in
the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 to commence implementation of accounting and consolidation
functionality related to a new enterprise resource planning, or ERP, system. Any ERP system problems
upon implementation, such as quality issues or programming errors, could impact our continued ability
to successfully operate our business or to timely and accurately report our financial results. These
changes may be costly and disruptive to our operations and could impose substantial demands on
management time. Failure to implement new or updated controls, or difficulties encountered in their
implementation, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting
obligations.
Identification of material weaknesses in our internal controls, even if quickly remediated once
disclosed, may cause investors to lose confidence in our financial statements and our stock price may
decline. Remediation of any material weakness could require us to incur significant expenses and if
we fail to remediate any material weakness, our financial statements may be inaccurate, we may be
required to restate our financial statements, our ability to report our financial results on a timely
and accurate basis may be adversely affected, our access to the capital markets may be restricted,
the trading price of our common stock may decline, and we may be subject to sanctions or
investigation by regulatory authorities.
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our business and could materially adversely affect our
financial condition and results of operations.
COVID-19 has impacted, and continues to impact, our workforce and operations and those of our
customers, partners, vendors and suppliers. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, the
increased duration and impact of economic and demand uncertainty, and the limited availability of our
supply chain and logistical services, may have a material net negative impact on our business and
financial results. While COVID-19 has driven an increase in sales for certain of our products, the
demand may not be sustainable if conditions change. COVID-19 containment around the world has put
restrictions on, among other areas, manufacturing facilities, commerce, and support operations could
limit our capacity to meet customer demand. Stronger demand globally has limited the availability of
capacity and components in our supply chain, which could increase our costs, limit our ability to
obtain supply at necessary levels or at all, or cause us to hold excess inventory if demand changes.
COVID-19’s effect on the global economy and our business is difficult to assess or predict. It has
resulted in, and may continue to result in, disruption of global financial markets, which could
negatively affect our stock price and liquidity. Volatility in the financial markets could impact
overall technology spending, adversely affecting demand for our products, our business and the value
of our common stock.
We have modified our business and workforce practices in response to COVID-19, and we may take
further actions as required by government regulations or in the best interests of our employees,
customers, partners and suppliers. There is no certainty that our actions will be sufficient to
mitigate the risks posed by the disease, and our ability to perform critical functions could be
harmed. When we begin to reopen our offices, we expect to incur incremental expenses as we resume
onsite services and related in-office costs.
The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance and
our ability to timely execute our business strategies may continue to be difficult to measure and
predict. An extended period of global supply chain and economic disruption as a result of the
COVID-19 pandemic could have a material negative impact on our business, results of operations, and
access to sources of liquidity and financial condition, though the full extent and duration of these
impacts is uncertain.
Our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate, and if our
operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price
could decline.
Our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate due to numerous
factors described in these risk factors. Therefore, investors should not rely on past comparisons of
our results of operations as an indication of our future performance. Additional factors that could
affect our results of operations include, but are not limited to:
• our ability to adjust spending to offset revenue shortfalls due to the multi-year development cycle
for some of our products and services;
 22 
 Table of Contents 
• our ability to comply with our customers’ contractual obligations;
• the inability of some customers to make required payments, our ability to obtain credit insurance
over the purchasing credit extended to these customers, and customer bad debt write-offs;
• unanticipated costs associated with environmental liabilities; and
• changes in financial accounting standards or interpretations of existing standards.
Any one or more of the factors discussed above could prevent us from achieving our expected future
financial results. Any such failure to meet our expectations or the expectations of our investors or
security analysts could cause our stock price to decline or experience substantial price volatility.
Risks Related to Regulatory, Legal, Our Stock and Other Matters
Our operations could be affected by the complex laws, rules and regulations to which our business is
subject, and political and other actions may adversely impact our business.
We are subject to laws and regulations domestically and worldwide, affecting our operations in areas
including, but not limited to, IP ownership and infringement; taxes; import and export requirements
and tariffs; anti-corruption; business acquisitions; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation
restrictions; data privacy requirements; competition and antitrust; advertising; employment; product
regulations; cybersecurity; environmental, health, and safety requirements; the responsible use of
AI; climate change; cryptocurrency; and consumer laws. Compliance with such requirements can be
onerous and expensive, could impact our competitive position, and may impact our business operations
negatively. For example, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws and
regulations prohibit us from engaging in certain business practices. There can be no assurance that
our employees, contractors, suppliers, or agents will not violate policies, controls, and procedures
that we have designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws. Violations of these laws and
regulations can result in fines; criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees;
prohibitions on the conduct of our business; and damage to our reputation. Should any of these laws,
rules and regulations be amended or expanded, or new ones enacted, we could incur materially greater
compliance costs and/or restrictions on our ability to manufacture our products and operate our
business. For example, we may face increased compliance costs as a result of changes or increases in
anti-competition legislation, regulation, administrative rule making, and enforcement activity
resulting from growing public concern over concentration of economic power in corporations.
Government actions, including trade protection and national security policies of U.S. and foreign
government bodies, such as tariffs, import or export regulations, including deemed export
restrictions, trade and economic sanctions, decrees, quotas or other trade barriers and restrictions
could affect our ability to ship products, provide services to our customers and employees, do
business without an export license with entities on the U.S. Department of Commerce’s U.S. Entity
List or other U.S. government restricted parties lists (which is expected to change from time to
time), and generally fulfill our contractual obligations and have a material adverse effect on our
business. For example, in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the United States and certain
allies have imposed economic sanctions and export control measures and may impose additional
sanctions or export control measures, which have and could in the future result in, among other
things, severe or complete restrictions on exports to and other commerce and business dealings
involving Russia, certain regions of Ukraine, and/or particular entities and individuals. Such
actions have limited or blocked, or could in the future limit or block the passage of our products,
services and support into Russia or other regions determined to be supporting Russia, and restrict
access by our Russian or Ukrainian employees (both within and outside of Russia and Ukraine) to our
systems, negatively impacting productivity. Given these recent sanctions and export restrictions
imposed by the United States and foreign government bodies, we recently ceased product sales to
Russia. While we have policies and procedures in place to ensure compliance with sanctions and trade
restrictions, our employees, contractors, partners, and agents may take actions in violations of such
policies and applicable law, for which we may be ultimately held responsible. If we were ever found
to have violated U.S. export control laws, we may be subject to various penalties available under the
laws, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and
financial condition. Additionally, changes in the public perception of governments in the regions
where we operate or plan to operate could negatively impact our business and results of operations.
Geopolitical tensions and conflicts worldwide, including but not limited to Taiwan, China, Hong Kong,
Israel and Korea where the manufacture of our product components and final assembly of our products
are concentrated, may result in changing regulatory requirements, trade policies, export controls,
import duties and economic disruptions that could impact our operating strategies, product demand,
access to global markets, hiring, and profitability. The increasing focus on the strategic importance
of AI technologies may result in additional regulatory restrictions that target products
 23 
 Table of Contents 
and services capable of enabling or facilitating AI, including some or all of our product and service
offerings. Such restrictions could limit our ability to serve demand abroad and could negatively
impact our business and financial results. Deemed export control limitations could negatively impact
the ability of our research and development teams to execute our roadmap or other objectives in a
timely manner.
Recent restrictions imposed by the Chinese government on the duration of gaming activities and access
to games may adversely affect our Gaming business. Additionally, revisions to laws or regulations or
their interpretation and enforcement could result in increased taxation, trade sanctions, the
imposition of import duties or tariffs, restrictions and controls on imports or exports, or other
retaliatory actions, which could have an adverse effect on our business plans or impact the timing of
our shipments.
Issues relating to the responsible use of AI in our offerings may result in reputational harm and
liability.
Concerns relating to the responsible use of new and evolving technologies, such as AI, in our
products and services, may result in reputational harm and liability, and may cause us to incur costs
to resolve such issues. We are increasingly building AI capabilities into many of our products and
services. AI presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption, and therefore our
business. AI poses emerging ethical issues and if we enable or offer solutions that draw controversy
due to their perceived or actual impact on society, or if we are unable to develop effective internal
policies and frameworks relating to the responsible development and use of AI models and systems
offered through our sales channels, we may experience brand or reputational harm, competitive harm or
legal liability. Compliance with government regulation in the area of AI ethics may also increase the
cost of related research and development. Our failure to address concerns relating to the responsible
use of AI by us or others could undermine public confidence in AI and slow adoption of AI in our
products and services or cause reputational harm.
Increased scrutiny from shareholders and others regarding our environmental, social and governance
responsibilities could result in additional costs or risks and adversely impact our reputation and
willingness of customers and suppliers to do business with us.
Shareholder advocacy groups, certain institutional investors, investment funds, other market
participants, shareholders and customers have focused increasingly on the ESG and sustainability
practices of companies, including those associated with climate change and human rights. These
parties have placed increased importance on the implications of the social cost of their investments.
If our ESG practices do not meet shareholder or other industry stakeholder expectations and
standards, which continue to evolve, our brand, reputation and business activities may be negatively
impacted. Any sustainability report that we publish or other sustainability disclosures we make may
include our policies and practices on a variety of social and ethical matters, including corporate
governance, environmental compliance, employee health and safety practices, human capital management,
product quality, supply chain management, and talent diversity and inclusion practices. It is
possible that stakeholders may not be satisfied with our ESG practices or the speed of their
adoption. We could also incur additional costs and require additional resources to monitor, report,
and comply with various ESG practices, or choose not to conduct business with potential customers, or
discontinue or not expand business with existing customers, due to our policies. Also, our failure,
or perceived failure, to meet the standards included in any sustainability disclosure could have a
material negative impact on our reputation and business activities.
Actions to adequately protect our IP rights could result in substantial costs to us and our ability
to compete could be harmed if we are unsuccessful or if we are prohibited from making or selling our
products.
From time to time, we are involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent
infringement or other IP rights violations by us, our employees or parties that we have agreed to
indemnify for claims of infringement. An unfavorable ruling could include significant damages,
invalidation of one or more patents, indemnification of third parties, payment of lost profits, or
injunctive relief. Claims that our products or processes infringe the IP rights of others, regardless
of their merit, could cause us to incur significant costs to respond to, defend, and resolve such
claims, and they may also divert the efforts and attention of management and technical personnel.
We may commence legal proceedings in order to protect our IP rights, which may increase our operating
expenses and negatively impact our operating results. We could be subject to countersuits as a
result. If infringement claims are made against us or our products are found to infringe a third
party’s IP, we or one of our indemnitees may have to seek a license to the third party’s IP rights.
However, we may not be able to obtain licenses at all or on terms acceptable to us. If we or one of
our indemnitees is unable to obtain such a license, we could be subject to substantial liabilities or
have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of our products. We may also
have to make royalty or other payments, or cross license our technology. If these arrangements are
not concluded on commercially reasonable
 24 
 Table of Contents 
terms, our business could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, the indemnification of a customer or
other indemnitee may increase our operating expenses which could negatively impact our operating
results.
We rely on patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements,
licensing arrangements, and the laws of the countries in which we operate to protect our IP. Foreign
laws may not protect our products or IP rights to the same extent as United States law. This makes
the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely. The theft or unauthorized use
or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could harm our
competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products; as a result, the value of our investment
in research and development, product development, and marketing could be reduced. We also may face
risks to our IP if our employees are hired by potential competitors. We continuously assess whether
and where to seek formal protection for existing and new innovations and technologies but cannot be
certain whether our applications for such protections will be approved, and, if approved, whether we
will be able to enforce such protections.
We are subject to stringent and changing data privacy and security obligations. Privacy concerns
relating to our products and services could damage our reputation, deter current and potential users
from using our products and services, or result in legal or regulatory proceedings and liability.
Our products and services may provide us with access to sensitive, confidential or personal data or
information that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations, industry standards, external
and internal policies, contracts and other obligations that govern the processing of such data by us
and on our behalf. Concerns about our practices or the ultimate use of our products and services with
regard to the collection, use, retention, security or disclosure of personal information or other
privacy-related matters, including for use in AI, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation and
adversely affect our operating results. The theft, loss, or misuse of personal data in our possession
or by one of our partners could result in damage to our reputation, regulatory proceedings,
disruption of our business activities or increased security costs and costs related to defending
legal claims.
Worldwide regulatory authorities are considering and have approved various legislative proposals
concerning data protection. The European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, or
GDPR, and the United Kingdom similarly adopted the U.K. GDPR, governing the strict handling of
personal data of persons within the European Economic Area, or EEA, and the United Kingdom,
respectively, including its use and protection and the ability of persons whose data is stored to
access, correct and delete such data about themselves. If we are found not to comply, we could be
subject to penalties of up to €20 million or 4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is greater, and
individuals may initiate litigation related to our processing of their personal data. Furthermore,
there exists a proposed European regulation related to AI that, if adopted, could impose onerous
obligations and could require us to change our business practices.
Certain jurisdictions have enacted data localization laws and cross-border personal data transfer
laws. For example, the GDPR generally restricts the transfer of personal data to countries outside of
the EEA. The European Commission released a set of “Standard Contractual Clauses” designed for
entities to validly transfer personal data out of the EEA to jurisdictions that the European
Commission has not found to provide an adequate level of protection, including the United States.
Other jurisdictions have enacted or are considering similar cross-border personal data transfer laws
and local personal data residency laws, any of which could increase the cost and complexity of doing
business. The inability to import personal data to the United States could significantly and
negatively impact our business operations, limit our ability to collaborate with parties that are
subject to European and other data privacy and security laws, or require us to increase our personal
data processing capabilities in Europe and/or elsewhere at significant expense.
The United States federal, state and local governments have enacted numerous data privacy and
security laws, including for data breach notification, personal data privacy, and consumer
protection. The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, or CCPA, gives California residents the
right to access, delete and opt-out of certain sharing of their personal information, and to receive
detailed information about how it is used and shared. The CCPA allows for statutory fines of up to
$7,500 per violation and the law created a private right of action for certain data breaches.
California’s privacy laws will further expand in 2023 under the California Privacy Rights Act of
2020, or CPRA, which may restrict the use of certain categories of sensitive personal information;
further restrict the use of cross-contextual advertising techniques; restrict the retention of
personal information; expand the types of data breaches subject to the private right of action; and
establish the California Privacy Protection Agency to impose administrative fines. Virginia passed
the Consumer Data Protection Act, and Colorado passed the Colorado Privacy Act, both of which differ
from the CPRA and become effective in 2023. If we become subject to new data privacy laws the risk of
enforcement action against us could increase as we become subject to additional obligations.
The interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the United States, Europe
and elsewhere are quickly changing and may be interpreted and applied in an increasingly stringent
fashion and in a manner that is
 25 
 Table of Contents 
inconsistent with our data practices. These obligations may necessitate changes to our information
technologies, systems, and practices and to those of any third parties that process personal data on
our behalf. Despite our efforts, our personnel or third parties upon whom we rely may fail to comply
with such obligations. If we fail, or are perceived to have failed, to address or comply with data
privacy and security obligations, we could face significant consequences, including but not limited
to, government enforcement actions, litigation, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight,
bans on processing personal data and orders to destroy or not use personal data. Any of these events
could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, or financial condition.
We have exposure to tax liabilities and our operating results may be adversely impacted by higher
than expected tax rates.
As a multinational corporation, we are subject to income taxes as well as non-income-based taxes,
such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, net worth, property and goods and services taxes, in both
the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. Our domestic and international tax liabilities
are subject to the allocation of revenue and expenses in different jurisdictions. Significant
judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax
liabilities. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions. For example,
we are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for our fiscal years 2018 and 2019
and under audit in Germany, Israel and India. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable,
tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken, and any adverse outcome of such a
review or audit could increase our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount of non-income
taxes imposed on our business, and harm our financial position, results of operations, and cash
flows. Further, changes in United States federal and state or international tax laws applicable to
multinational corporations or other fundamental law changes, including proposed changes to existing
tax rules and regulations under the current U.S. administration and Congress and as a result of
recommendations from intergovernmental economic organizations such as the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development, or OECD, may materially impact our tax expense and cash flows, as we
experienced in fiscal year 2018 with the passage of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or TCJA. Starting
in fiscal year 2023, the TCJA requires taxpayers to capitalize research and development expenditures
and to amortize domestic expenditures over five years and foreign expenditures over fifteen years. If
Congress does not modify or repeal this provision, it will materially reduce our cash flows beginning
in fiscal year 2023. Furthermore, recent proposals to increase the U.S. corporate income tax rate or
impose a minimum tax on financial statement income, increase U.S. taxation of international business
operations and impose a global minimum tax, could result in increased marginal corporate tax rates.
Numerous countries, as well as organizations such as the OECD, support the global minimum tax
initiative and are considering changes to existing tax laws or have proposed or enacted new laws that
could increase our tax obligations in countries where we do business or cause us to change the way we
operate our business, which could materially impact our results of operations.
Our future effective tax rate may also be affected by changes in our business or statutory rates,
changes in jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed, changes in
available tax credits, the resolution of issues arising from tax audits, changes in United States
generally accepted accounting principles, adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax
returns, increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, changes in the valuation of our
deferred tax assets and liabilities and in deferred tax valuation allowances, changing interpretation
of existing laws or regulations, the impact of accounting for stock-based compensation and the
recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies within the income tax provision in the period
in which they occur, the impact of accounting for business combinations, shifts in the amount of
earnings in the United States compared with other regions in the world and overall levels of income
before tax, changes in the domestic or international organization of our business and structure, as
well as the expiration of statute of limitations and settlements of audits. Any changes in our
effective tax rate may reduce our net income.
Our business is exposed to the risks associated with litigation, investigations and regulatory
proceedings.
We currently and will likely continue to face legal, administrative and regulatory proceedings,
claims, demands and/or investigations involving shareholder, consumer, competition and/or other
issues relating to our business. For example, we are currently defending on appeal the dismissal of a
securities class action lawsuit from multiple shareholders seeking to assert claims that we and
certain of our officers made false and/or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the
impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand in 2017 and 2018. Litigation and regulatory proceedings
are inherently uncertain, and adverse rulings could occur, including monetary damages or fines, or an
injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain products, engaging in certain business
practices, or requiring other remedies, such as compulsory licensing of patents. An unfavorable
outcome or settlement may result in a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations,
financial position, and overall trends. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can be costly, time-
consuming, and disruptive to our operations. Our business is subject to laws and
 26 
 Table of Contents 
regulations that are complex and change frequently. We may be required to incur significant expense
to comply with changes in, or remedy violations of, these laws and regulations.
Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position and cash flows from operations, and
prevent us from implementing our strategy or fulfilling our contractual obligations.
As of January 30, 2022, we had outstanding a total of $11 billion in notes due by 2060. As each
series of senior notes matures, unless earlier redeemed or repurchased, we have to repay or refinance
the notes. If we decide to refinance, we may be required to do so on different or less favorable
terms or we may be unable to refinance the notes at all, both of which may adversely affect our
financial condition. We also have a $575 million commercial paper program.
Maintenance of our indebtedness and contractual restrictions, and future issuances of indebtedness
could cause us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations towards debt
service obligations and principal repayments; increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in
general economic, industry and competitive conditions; limit our flexibility in planning for, or
reacting to, changes in our business and our industry; impair our ability to obtain future financing
for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate or other purposes; and
restrict our ability to grant liens on property, enter into certain mergers, dispose of all or
substantially all of our assets, or materially change our business.
We are required to comply with the covenants set forth in our indenture and our ability to comply may
be affected by events beyond our control. If we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a
waiver from the note holders or lenders, then any outstanding indebtedness may be declared
immediately due and payable. Changes by any rating agency to our credit rating may negatively impact
the value and liquidity of our securities, restrict our ability to obtain financing in the future and
affect the terms of any such financing.
Delaware law and our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and agreement with Microsoft Corporation
could delay or prevent a change in control.
Our status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General
Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control. Our certificate of
incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to
acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock. These provisions include the ability of our Board
of Directors to create and issue preferred stock, change the number of directors, and to make, amend
or repeal our bylaws without prior shareholder approval; the inability of our shareholders to act by
written consent or to call special meetings; advance notice requirements for director nominations and
shareholder proposals; and a super-majority voting requirement to amend some provisions in our
certificate of incorporation and bylaws. In 2000, we entered into an agreement with Microsoft to
develop and sell graphics chips and license certain technology to Microsoft and its licensees for use
in the Xbox. Under the agreement, if someone makes an offer to purchase at least 30% of the
outstanding shares of our common stock, Microsoft may have first and last rights of refusal to
purchase the stock. These provisions could delay or prevent a change in control of NVIDIA, discourage
proxy contests, and make it more difficult for shareholders to elect directors of their choosing and
to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire.
