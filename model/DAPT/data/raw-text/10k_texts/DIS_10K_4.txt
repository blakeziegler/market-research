“Incoming” as used above under “Committees” indicates that the Board intends to appoint the Director 
to such committee, in the case of Ms. Everson, or as Chair of such committee, in the case of Mr. 
Parker and Mr. Rice, following the 2023 Annual Meeting. 12 
Audit Committee 
Members: Safra A. Catz (Sitting Chair), Francis A. deSouza and Derica W. Rice (Incoming Chair) 
The Audit Committee is responsible for, among other things, overseeing the Company’s financial 
statements, internal controls and audit, compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and 
independent auditor. The Committee also has oversight of cybersecurity and data security risks and 
mitigation strategies. The Committee also reviews the Company’s policies and practices with respect 
to risk assessment and risk management. The Committee met 9 times during fiscal 2022. All of the 
members of the Committee are independent within the meaning of SEC regulations, the listing standards
of the New York Stock Exchange and the Company’s Corporate Governance Guidelines. The Board has 
determined that all members of the Committee, Ms. Catz, Mr. deSouza and Mr. Rice, are qualified as 
audit committee financial experts within the meaning of SEC regulations and that they have accounting
and related financial management expertise within the meaning of the listing standards of the New 
York Stock Exchange and that Mr. Froman, who served on the Committee through January 10, 2022, is 
financially literate within the meaning of the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange. The 
Board has determined that Mr. Rice’s simultaneous service on the audit committees of more than three 
public companies will not impair his ability to effectively serve on the Committee. Following the 
2023 Annual Meeting, the Board intends to appoint Mr. Rice as the Chair of the Committee. Ms. Catz 
will remain as a member of the Committee. 
Corporate Governance Documents 
The Board has adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines, which set forth a flexible framework within 
which the Board, assisted by its committees, directs the affairs of the Company. The Guidelines 
address, among other things, the composition and functions of the Board, Director independence, stock
ownership by and compensation of Directors, management succession and review, Board leadership, Board
committees and selection of new Directors. 
The Company has Standards of Business Conduct, which are applicable to all employees of the Company, 
including the principal executive officer, the principal financial officer and the principal 
accounting officer. The Board has a separate Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for Directors, which
contains provisions specifically applicable to Directors. 
Each standing committee of the Board is governed by a charter adopted by the Board. 
The Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Standards of Business Conduct, the Code of Business Conduct 
and Ethics for Directors and each of the Audit, Compensation and Governance and Nominating Committee 
charters are available on the Company’s Investor Relations website under the “Corporate Governance” 
heading at www.disney.com/investors and in print to any shareholder who requests them from the 
Company’s Secretary. If the Company amends or waives the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for 
Directors or the Standards of Business Conduct with respect to the principal executive officer, 
principal financial officer or principal accounting officer, it will post the amendment or waiver at 
the same location on its website. 
 13 
Director Selection Process Working closely with the full Board, the Governance and Nominating 
Committee develops criteria for open Board positions. Applying these criteria, the Committee 
considers candidates for Board membership suggested by Committee members, other Board members, 
management and shareholders. The Committee retains third-party executive search firms to identify and
review candidates, including to generate candidate pools consistent with the criteria below, upon 
request of the Committee from time to time. Once the Committee has identified a prospective nominee —
including prospective nominees recommended by shareholders — it determines whether to conduct a full 
evaluation. The Committee may request the third-party search firm to gather additional information 
about the prospective nominee’s background and experience and to report its findings. The Committee 
then evaluates the prospective nominee against the specific criteria that it has established for the 
position, as well as the standards and qualifications set out in the Company’s Corporate Governance 
Guidelines, including but not limited to: 
 • the ability of the prospective nominee to represent the interests of the shareholders of the 
 Company; 
 • the extent to which the prospective nominee contributes to the range of talent, skill and 
 expertise appropriate for the Board; and 
 the extent to which the prospective nominee helps the Board reflect the diversity of the 
 • Company’s shareholders, employees, customers and guests and the communities in which it 
 operates. 
After completing this evaluation and an interview, the Committee makes a recommendation to the full 
Board, which makes the final determination whether to nominate or appoint the new director after 
considering the Committee’s report. In selecting director nominees, the Board seeks to achieve a mix 
of members who together bring experience and personal backgrounds relevant to the Company’s strategic
priorities and the scope and complexity of the Company’s business. The current nominees’ 
qualifications set forth in their individual biographies under the section titled “ Directors” sets 
out how each of the current nominees (comprised of all current Directors other than Ms. Arnold) 
contributes to the mix of experience and qualifications the Board seeks. The Board also considers the
tenure policy under the Corporate Governance Guidelines, pursuant to which the Board will not 
nominate for re-electionany non-managementDirector that completed fifteen years of service as a 
member of the Board on or prior to the date of election or any Director that turned 75 years of age 
of older in the calendar year preceding the related annual meeting, in each case, unless the Board 
concludes that such Director’s continuing service would better serve the best interests of the 
shareholders. In making its recommendations with respect to the nomination for election or re- 
electionof existing Directors at the annual shareholders meeting, the Committee assesses the 
composition of the Board at the time and considers the extent to which the Board continues to reflect
the criteria set forth above. During fiscal 2023, the Board appointed two new directors: Carolyn 
Everson and Bob Iger. Ms. Everson was recommended by non-managementdirectors, a third-party search 
firm and a shareholder. In connection with Ms. Everson’s appointment, the Company entered into a 
support agreement with Third Point pursuant to which the Company appointed Ms. Everson as a director 
and agreed to include Ms. Everson as a director nominee for the 2023 Annual Meeting and Third Point 
agreed to customary standstill, voting and other provisions through the 2024 Annual Meeting. Mr. Iger
was recommended by non-managementdirectors. The Company has agreed in Mr. Iger’s employment agreement
to nominate him for re-electionas a member of the Board at the expiration of each term of office 
during the term of the agreement, and he has agreed to continue to serve on the Board if elected. A 
shareholder who wishes to recommend a prospective nominee for the Board should notify the Company’s 
Secretary or any member of the Governance and Nominating Committee in writing with whatever 
supporting material the shareholder considers appropriate. The Governance and Nominating Committee 
will also consider whether to nominate any person nominated by a shareholder pursuant to the 
provisions of the Company’s Bylaws relating to shareholder nominations. 14 
ITEM 11. Executive Compensation Director Compensation Fiscal 2022 The elements of annual Director 
compensation for fiscal 2022 were as follows: 
 Annual Board retainer $ 115,000 
 Annual committee retainer (except Executive $ 10,000 
 Committee)1 
 Annual Governance and Nominating Committee chair $ 20,000 
 retainer2 
 Annual Compensation Committee chair retainer2 $ 25,000 
 Annual Audit Committee chair retainer2 $ 27,500 
 Annual deferred stock unit grant $ 240,000 
 Annual retainer for independent Chairman3 $ 145,000 
 1 Per committee. 
 2 This is in addition to the annual committee retainer the Director receives for serving on the 
 committee. 
 3 This is in addition to the annual Board retainer, committee fees and the annual deferred stock 
 unit grant and at least 50% must be paid in stock. 
To encourage Directors to experience the Company’s products, services and entertainment offerings 
personally, each non-employeeDirector may receive Company products and services up to a maximum of 
$15,000 in fair market value per calendar year plus reimbursement of associated tax liabilities. Each
first-year non-employeeDirector may receive Company products and services up to a maximum of $25,000 
in fair market value plus reimbursement of associated tax liabilities for one year following their 
respective start date. After the first anniversary of their start date, such first-year non- 
employeeDirectors will have an additional allowance of $15,000 prorated for the balance of the 
remaining calendar year. Directors’ spouses, children and grandchildren may also participate in this 
benefit within each Director’s limit. Family members of Directors may accompany Directors traveling 
on Company aircraft for business purposes on a space-available basis. Directors participate in the 
Company’s employee gift matching program on the same terms as senior executives. Under this program, 
the Company matches contributions of up to $20,000 per calendar year per Director to charitable and 
educational institutions meeting the Company’s criteria. Beginning in calendar 2022, the Board 
amended the Directors’ participation in the Company’s employee gift matching program to decrease the 
maximum amount of contributions matched by the Company from $50,000 to $20,000 per calendar year. 
Directors who are also employees of the Company receive no additional compensation for service as a 
Director. Under the Company’s Corporate Governance Guidelines, non-employeeDirector compensation is 
determined annually by the Board acting on the recommendation of the Governance and Nominating 
Committee. In formulating its recommendation, the Governance and Nominating Committee receives input 
from the third-party compensation consultant retained by the Compensation Committee regarding market 
practices for Director compensation. 15

Fees Earned or Paid in Cash. “Fees Earned or Paid in Cash” includes the annual Board retainer and 
annual committee and committee-chair retainers, whether paid currently or deferred by the Director to
be paid in cash or shares after service ends. Directors are permitted to elect each year to receive 
all or part of their retainers in Disney stock and, whether paid in cash or stock, to defer all or 
part of their retainers until after service as a Director ends. Directors who elect to receive 
deferred compensation in cash receive a credit each quarter and the balance in their deferred cash 
account earns interest at an annual rate equal to 120% of the Applicable Long-Term Federal Interest 
Rate, as determined from time to time by the United States Internal Revenue Service. For fiscal 2022,
the average interest rate was 3.67%. The following table sets forth the form of fees received by each
Director who elected to receive any portion of the compensation in a form other than currently paid 
cash. The number of stock units awarded is equal to the dollar amount of fees accruing each quarter 
divided by the average over the last ten trading days of the quarter of the average of the high and 
low trading price for shares of Company common stock on each day in the ten-dayperiod. Stock units 
distributed currently were accumulated throughout the year and distributed as shares following 
December 31, 2022.

Stock Awards. “Stock Awards” sets forth the market value of the deferred stock unit grants to 
Directors and the amount reported is equal to the market value of the Company’s common stock on the 
date of the award times the number of shares underlying the units. Units are awarded at the end of 
each quarter and the number of units is determined by dividing the amount payable with respect to the
quarter by the average over the last ten trading days of the quarter of the average of the high and 
low trading price for shares of the Company common stock on each day in the ten-dayperiod. Each 
Director other than Ms. Arnold was awarded 2,044 units in fiscal 2022. Ms. Arnold was awarded 2,544 
units in fiscal 2022 due to the annual retainer for independent Chairman. Unless a Director elects to
defer receipt of shares until after the Director’s service ends, shares with respect to annual 
deferred stock unit grants are normally distributed to the Director on the second anniversary of the 
award date, whether or not the Director is still a Director on the date of distribution. At the end 
of any quarter in which dividends are distributed to shareholders, Directors receive additional stock
units with a value (based on the average of the high and low trading prices of the Company common 
stock averaged over the last ten trading days of the quarter) equal to the amount of dividends they 
would have received on all stock units held by them at the end of the prior quarter. Shares with 
respect to these additional units are distributed when the underlying units are distributed. Units 
awarded in respect of dividends are included in the fair value of the stock units when the units are 
initially awarded and therefore are not included in the tables above, but they are included in the 
total units held at the end of the fiscal year in the table below. The following table sets forth all
stock units held by each non-managementDirector serving during fiscal 2022, as of the end of fiscal 
2022. All stock units are fully vested when granted, but shares are distributed with respect to the 
units only later, as described above. Stock units in this table are included in the stock ownership 
table in Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related 
Stockholder Matters - “Stock Ownership” except to the extent they may have been distributed as shares
and sold prior to the date of the stock ownership table.

The Company’s Corporate Governance Guidelinesencourage Directors to own or acquire within three years
of first becoming a Director, shares of Company common stock (including stock units received as 
Director compensation) having a market value of at least five times the amount of the annual Board 
retainer for the Director. Unless the Board exempts a Director, each Director is also required to 
retain stock representing no less than 50% of the after-taxvalue of exercised options and shares 
received upon distribution of deferred stock units until such Director meets the stock holding 
guideline described above. All Other Compensation. “All Other Compensation” includes: 
 Reimbursement of tax liabilities associated with the product familiarization benefits. The 
 value of the product familiarization benefits themselves and travel benefits are not 
 • included in the table as permitted by SEC rules because the aggregate incremental cost to 
 the Company of providing these benefits did not exceed $10,000 for any Director. The 
 reimbursement of associated tax liabilities was $1,475 for Ms. Arnold, $6,520 for Ms. Chang, 
 $5,296 for Mr. deSouza, $16,968 for Mr. Froman and $100 for Ms. Lagomasino.

 • Interest earned on deferred cash compensation, which was less than $10,000 for each 
 Director. 
 The matching charitable contribution of the Company, which was $25,000 for Ms. Arnold, 
 $50,000 for Ms. Catz, $35,000 for Ms. Chang, $55,000 for Mr. Froman and $70,000 for Mr.  
 • Rice. Matched amounts exceed $20,000 in a fiscal year if contributions for separate calendar 
 years are made in the same fiscal year or if there were delays in processing earlier year 
 matches and due to the change in maximum amount of contributions matched by the Company in 
 calendar 2022. 
 • In fiscal 2022, the Company reimbursed security charges to Ms. Arnold totaling $32,985 for 
 equipment and security services. 
Executive Compensation Compensation Discussion and Analysis Fiscal 2022 Performance Highlights As 
described in more detail under “ Executive Compensation — Compensation Discussion and Analysis— 
Individual Compensation Decisions”below, our named executive officers (“NEOs”) who remain with the 
Company showed strong performance and leadership both in managing the Company and in driving a 
transformation of our businesses, building long-term value. In fiscal 2022, we continued to see 
strong demand and growth across our businesses and execute on our long-term strategy. Our content, 
across our unmatched collection of brands, formats and distribution platforms, continues to 
meaningfully resonate with audiences around the world and fuel our portfolio of businesses. We 
continue to invest in our Media and Entertainment Distribution businesses, ending the fiscal year 
with over 235 million total DTC subscriptions, preparing to launch the advertising-based tier of 
Disney+ and generating nearly $3.5 billion at the global box office. At our Parks, Experiences and 
Products business, we are beyond pleased with our recovery coming out of the pandemic, launching 
several new attractions and experiences, resulting in the segment’s largest full year revenue, 
operating income and margin. While our share price performance was in line with many Media Industry 
peers this past year, fiscal 2022 share price performance was challenging for the Company. As we look
forward, our leadership team remains focused on building long-term value for our shareholders, and 
our Compensation Committee remains committed to an executive compensation program that motivates 
executives to achieve these goals and aligns pay outcomes with Company performance. 18 
FISCAL 2022 COMPENSATION PRACTICES Executive Compensation Objectives and Methods:We maintain an 
integrated approach to attract and retain high-caliber executives in a competitive market for talent,
while adhering to key corporate governance best practices summarized below. 
 Investor Relations and members of the Board regularly 
 engage in investor outreach. With regard to executive 
 compensation, the Compensation Committee has addressed 
 shareholder feedback and made changes to compensation for 
 fiscal 2022, including:   •  Utilized the structure of 
 50% of the CEO’s fiscal 2022 equity award as 
 performance-based restricted stock units (“PBUs”), in 
 response to feedback to prioritize pay for performance.   
 Shareholder engagement and •  Increased PBUs from 30% to 50% of the overall 
 responsiveness long-term incentive grant value for the NEOs other than 
 the CEO.   •  Increased the rigor of the test for the 
 total shareholder return (“TSR”) portion of PBUs by 
 setting target performance at the 55th percentile of the 
 S&P 500 companies, an increase from the 50th percentile, 
 with maximum payout at 200% of target.   •  For the 
 fiscal 2022 annual bonus plan, significantly increased 
 the required revenue and operating income amounts to 
 achieve target-level payouts year-over-year. 
 Fiscal 2022 bonus plan maintains incorporation of 
 Incentive plan non-financial metrics diversity and inclusion (e.g., representation, retention 
 and content), which has the highest weighting among a 
 limited number of focused non-financial metrics. 
 NEOs must hold a meaningful amount of the Company’s 
 stock. The CEO must hold equity valued at five times his 
 Equity retention guidelines salary within five years of becoming CEO, while other 
 NEOs must hold equity valued at three times their salary 
 within five years of becoming an executive officer. 
 A majority of NEO compensation is tied to either short- 
 or long-term Company performance. For Robert A. Chapek in 
 fiscal 2022, 90% of his total target compensation was 
 Compensation at risk tied to financial performance, contributions towards 
 organization goals, equity compensation or stock price 
 performance. This includes 50% of his annual equity grant 
 awarded in PBUs. 
 Each year, the Compensation Committee’s compensation 
 consultant completes a risk assessment of the Company’s 
 compensation programs. Based on this assessment for 
 Annual risk assessment fiscal 2022, the Compensation Committee determined that 
 risks arising from the Company’s policies and practices 
 are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse 
 effect on the Company. 
 The Board may recover or cancel any bonus or incentive 
 Clawback policy payments in cases where an executive’s misconduct results 
 in either financial or reputational harm. 
 Board members, NEOs and all other Section 16 filers are 
 Disallow hedging and pledging prohibited from hedging and pledging the Company’s 
 securities. 
 No option re-pricing or cash buyouts The Company does not allow re-pricing or cash buyouts of 
 underwater stock options without shareholder approval. 
 No excise tax gross-ups The Company does not provide excise tax gross-ups. 
 The Compensation Committee has retained a compensation 
 Independent compensation consultant consultant whose relationship with the Company was 
 confirmed to be independent for fiscal 2022. 
19 
CHANGES FOR FISCAL 2023 After fiscal year 2022, on November 20, 2022, the Company exercised its right
to involuntarily terminate Mr. Chapek’s employment. For details of his separation, please see the 
section titled “Executive Compensation — Compensation Tables — Potential Payments and Rights on 
Termination or Change in Control”below. 
 On November 20, 2022, the 
 Company 
 entered into an employment 
 agreement 
 with Mr. Iger and he was 
 appointed as 
 CEO. In connection with the 
 agreement, 
 Mr. Iger’s annual base salary 
 was set at 
 $1,000,000 and he is eligible 
 for an 
 annual bonus determined 
 through 
 financial and individual 
 performance 
 objectives with a target of 
 100% of base 
 salary (up to a maximum of 
 200%). Mr. 
 Iger’s annual long-term 
 incentive grant 
 target is $25,000,000 and will 
 have the 
 following vehicle mix: 
 60% PBUs and 40% stock 
 options. The PBUs 
 have a 2-year performance 
 period aligned 
 with the term of his 
 employment 
 agreement. The Committee 
 determined that 
 Mr. Iger’s interest in the 
 value of his 
 existing equity holdings 
 aligned with 
 his mandate to develop a 
 long-term 
 successor by 2024. The 
 Committee also Increase to 60%   
 evaluated the long-term Performance-Based Units for the 
 incentive CEO 
 structure of the CEO and NEOs’ 
 executive 
 compensation programs. 
 Starting in 
 fiscal 2020, 50% of PBUs were 
 eligible 
 to vest based on return on 
 invested 
 capital (“ROIC”) performance. 
 While the 
 initial intent was to set a 
 full 3-year 
 ROIC goal, due to challenges 
 in 
 forecasting posed by the 
 COVID-19 
 pandemic, ROIC goals have been 
 set and 
 measured each year of the 
 3-year 
 performance period for grants 
 made in 
 fiscal 2020 through fiscal 
 2022. In 
 November 2022, the 
 Compensation 
 Committee determined that 
 long-term 
 incentive grants made in 
 fiscal 2023 
 (i.e., in December 2022) will 
 utilize a 
 full 3-year goal for the ROIC 
 portion of 
 PBUs, excluding Mr. Iger’s 
 long-term 
 incentive grant, which will 
 have a 
 2-year performance period to 
 reflect his 
 2-year employment term.

The following chart shows the percentage of the target total direct annual compensation for Mr. Iger 
that varies with performance and equity versus being fixed with respect to fiscal 2023. Performance- 
based and equity compensation represents target performance-based bonus and equity awards while fixed
compensation represents base salary. 20 
Executive Compensation Program Structure — Objectives and Methods 
We design our executive compensation program to drive the creation of long-term shareholder value. We
do this by tying compensation to the achievement of performance goals that promote the creation of 
shareholder value and by designing compensation to attract and retain high-caliber executives in a 
competitive market for talent. We aim to provide compensation opportunities that take into account 
compensation levels and practices of our peers. For a more detailed description of the peer groups we
use for compensation purposes, see the discussion under the heading, “Executive Compensation — Other 
Compensation Information— Peer Groups,” set forth below. Total direct compensation comprises a mix of
variable and fixed compensation that is heavily weighted toward variable performance-based 
compensation. Our performance-based compensation includes a short-term annual performance-based bonus
and longer-term equity awards that deliver value based on stock price performance and in the case of 
performance-based stock units, whose vesting depends on meeting performance targets. As prospective 
performance targets are central to our business strategy, for competitive reasons we do not publicly 
disclose them for either the short-term annual performance-based bonus plan or the long-term 
incentive plan. The Company enters into employment agreements with our senior executives when the 
Compensation Committee determines that it is appropriate to attract or retain an executive or where 
an employment agreement is consistent with our practices with respect to other similarly situated 
executives. 
 21 
The following table sets forth the elements of total direct compensation in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 
2023 and the objectives and key features of each element: 
 OBJECTIVES AND KEY FEATURES 
 SALARY   Objectives: The 
 Compensation Committee sets 
 salaries to reflect job 
 responsibilities and to provide 
 competitive fixed pay to balance 
 performance-based risks.   Key 
 Features:   •  Minimum salaries 
 set in employment agreement   •  
 Committee discretion to adjust 
 annually based on changes in 
 experience, nature and 
 responsibility of the position, 
 competitive considerations and 
 CEO recommendation (except in 
 the case of the CEO) 
 PERFORMANCE-BASED BONUS   
 Objectives: 
 The Compensation Committee 
 structures 
 the bonus program to 
 incentivize 
 performance at the high end of 
 the 
 financial performance measure 
 ranges 
 that it establishes each year. 
 The 
 Committee believes that 
 incentivizing 
 performance in this fashion 
 will lead to 
 long-term, sustainable gains 
 in 
 shareholder value. Key 
 Features: 
 • Target bonus for each NEO 
 set by the 
 Committee early in the fiscal 
 year in 
 light of employment agreement 
 provisions, competitive 
 considerations, 
 CEO recommendation (except 
 targets for 
 the CEO) and other factors the 
 Committee 
 deems appropriate; bonus 
 opportunity 
 normally limited to 200% of 
 target bonus 
 • Unless otherwise adjusted 
 downward by 
 the Committee, payout on 70% 
 of target 
 is formulaic and determined by 
 performance against financial 
 performance ranges developed 
 by the 
 Committee early in the fiscal 
 year • 
 Unless otherwise determined by 
 the 
 Committee, payout on 30% of 
 target 
 determined by Company-wide 
 Other 
 Performance Factors and the 
 Committee’s 
 assessment of individual 
 performance 
 based both on other 
 performance 
 objectives and on CEO 
 recommendation 
 (except the payouts for the 
 CEO) 
 EQUITY AWARDS   Objectives: The 
 Compensation Committee 
 structures equity awards to 
 directly reward long-term gains 
 in shareholder value. Equity 
 awards carry vesting terms that 
 now extend for three years and 
 include PBUs whose value 
 depends on Company performance, 
 including performance relative 
 to the S&P 500. These awards 
 provide incentives to create 
 and sustain long-term growth in 
 shareholder value.   Key 
 Features:   •  Combined value 
 of options, performance units 
 and time-based units determined 
 by the Committee in light of 
 employment agreement 
 provisions, competitive market 
 conditions, evaluation of 
 executive’s performance and CEO 
 recommendation (except awards 
 for the CEO)   •  For fiscal 
 2022, allocation of annual 
 awards for Mr. Iger in his role 
 as Executive Chairman (based on 
 award value): 50% PBUs; 50% 
 stock options. For fiscal 2023, 
 in his role as CEO, the 
 allocation of annual awards 
 will be: 60% PBUs and 40% stock 
 options   •  Allocation of 
 annual awards for other NEOs 
 including Mr. Chapek in fiscal 
 2022 (based on award value): 
 50% PBUs; 25% time-based 
 restricted stock units; 25% 
 stock options     STOCK OPTION 
 AWARDS   Key Features:   •   
 Exercise price equal to average 
 of the high and low trading 
 prices on day of award   •   
 Option re-pricing without 
 shareholder approval is 
 prohibited   •  Ten-year term   
 •  Vest one-third per year     
 ANNUAL PERFORMANCE-BASED 
 RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS   Key 
 Features:   •  PBUs reward 
 executives only if specified 
 financial performance measures 
 are met   •  PBUs vest subject 
 to the level of achievement 
 under multiple multi-year 
 performance tests   •  Half of 
 awards vest based on three-year 
 cumulative TSR relative to the 
 S&P 500; the other half vest 
 based on three-year ROIC 
 measured over three one-year 
 performance periods. For fiscal 
 2022, ROIC awards included 
 three measurement periods of 
 one year each due to continued 
 financial uncertainties 
 resulting from the COVID-19 
 pandemic. For fiscal 2023, ROIC 
 awards include one measurement 
 period of three years (two 
 years in the case of Mr. Iger). 
 Awards as described in the 
 section titled “Executive 
 Compensation — Compensation 
 Tables — Fiscal 2022 Grants of 
 Plan Based Awards Table”     
 ANNUAL TIME-BASED RESTRICTED 
 STOCK UNITS   Key Features:   • 
 One-third vests each year 
 following grant date   •   
 Annual units awarded to 
 executive officers are subject 
 to Section 162(m) test to the 
 extent necessary and available 
 to obtain tax deductibility by 
 the Company of the payments   • 
 For fiscal 2023, Mr. Iger will 
 not receive time-based RSUs 
22 
COMPENSATION AT RISK The Compensation Committee believes that most of the compensation for NEOs 
should be at risk and tied to a combination of long-term and short-term Company performance. In 
fiscal 2022, our NEOs consisted of Mr. Chapek, Christine McCarthy, Horacio Gutierrez, Paul 
Richardson, Kristina Schake, Mr. Iger and Geoffrey Morrell. In establishing a mix of fixed to 
variable compensation, the composition of equity awards, target bonus levels, grant date equity award
values and performance ranges, the Committee seeks to maintain its goal of making compensation 
overwhelmingly tied to performance, while also providing compensation opportunities that are 
competitive with alternatives available to the executive. In particular, the Committee expects that 
performance at the high-endof ranges will result in overall compensation that is sufficiently 
attractive relative to compensation available at successful competitors and that performance at the 
low-endof ranges will result in overall compensation that is less than that available from 
competitors with more successful performance. The following charts show the percentage of the target 
total direct annual compensation for first, Mr. Chapek, and second, all NEOs other than Mr. Chapek 
and Mr. Iger, that varies with performance and equity versus being fixed with respect to fiscal 2022.
Performance-based and equity compensation represents target performance-based bonus and equity awards
while fixed compensation represents base salary. Beginning in fiscal 2022, the Compensation Committee
determined to increase PBUs from 30% to 50% of the overall long-term incentive grant value for the 
NEOs other than the CEO, who already had 50% in the form of PBUs (and who will have 60% in the form 
of PBUs for fiscal 2023). This shift reflects a meaningful increase in at-riskcompensation, as 
evidenced by the actual results realized with respect to recent PBU grants. For example, below is a 
table reflecting annual grant PBUs vesting in the last five years which resulted in below target 
payouts: 
 VESTED IN VESTED IN VESTED IN VESTED IN VESTED IN 
 DECEMBER 2018 DECEMBER 2019 DECEMBER 2020 DECEMBER 2021 DECEMBER 2022 
 % of Target 85% 96% 62% 48% 50% 
 Payout 
23 
The fiscal 2021 ROIC test resulted in a 150% payout, which is being assessed for outstanding PBU 
grants made in December 2019 and 2020. The fiscal 2022 ROIC test had a threshold, target and maximum 
of 1.6%, 4.1% and 5.4% respectively. Actual fiscal 2022 ROIC performance was just under 5.4%, which 
resulted in 148% payout for the fiscal 2022 portion of the ROIC test, which is being assessed for 
outstanding PBU grants made in December 2019 and 2020. As the maximum payout for fiscal 2022 PBU 
awards increased to 200% of target, ROIC performance of approximately 5.4% resulted in a 196% payout 
for the fiscal 2022 ROIC portion of grants made in December 2021. The Compensation Committee believes
this PBU structure strongly aligns pay and performance, which is underscored by the decision to 
further increase the weighting of PBUs for other NEOs. COMPENSATION PROCESS The following table 
outlines the process for determining annual compensation awards for NEOs:

 shares on the date of award 
24 
MANAGEMENT INPUT In addition to the Chief Executive Officer recommendations described above, 
management regularly: 
 • provides data, analysis and recommendations to the Compensation Committee regarding the 
 Company’s executive compensation programs and policies; 
 • administers those programs and policies as directed by the Committee; 
 • provides an ongoing review of the effectiveness of the compensation programs, including 
 competitiveness and alignment with the Company’s objectives; and 
 • recommends changes to compensation programs if needed to help achieve program objectives. 
The Committee meets regularly in executive session without management present to discuss compensation
decisions and matters relating to the design and operation of the executive compensation program. 
COMPENSATION CONSULTANT The Compensation Committee retained Pay Governance LLC as the compensation 
consultant for fiscal 2022. The consultant assists the Committee’s development and evaluation of 
compensation policies and practices and the Committee’s determinations of compensation awards through
various services, including providing third-party data, advice and expertise on proposed executive 
compensation awards and plan designs; reviewing briefing materials prepared by management and outside
advisers; and advising the Committee on the matters included in these materials and preparing its own
analysis of compensation matters. The Committee considers input from the consultant as one factor in 
making decisions on compensation matters, along with information and analyses it receives from 
management and its own judgment and experience. The Committee has adopted a policy requiring its 
consultant to be independent of Company management. The Committee performs an annual assessment of 
the consultant’s independence to determine whether the consultant is independent. The Committee 
assessed Pay Governance LLC’s independence in December 2022 and confirmed that the firm’s work has 
not raised any conflict of interest and the firm is independent. Pay Governance LLC does not provide 
any services to the Company other than the services provided to the Compensation Committee. Fiscal 
2022 Compensation Decisions This section discusses the specific decisions made by the Compensation 
Committee in fiscal 2022. These decisions were made taking into consideration the results of the most
recent shareholder advisory vote on executive compensation. Based on the results of the advisory vote
on executive compensation, members of management and the Board engaged in extensive outreach to 
shareholders. The Board took several actions in response to the shareholder feedback received. 
PERFORMANCE GOALS The Compensation Committee normally develops performance goals for each fiscal year
early in that year and evaluates performance against those goals after the fiscal year has ended to 
arrive at its compensation decisions. ANNUAL INCENTIVE GOALS Annual Incentive Financial Performance 
In November 2021, the Compensation Committee reviewed the annual performance-based bonus program. The
Committee determined to retain the financial measures and relative weights for calculating the 
portion of the NEOs bonuses that is based on financial performance as follows: 
 • adjusted segment operating income—50% 
25 
 • adjusted revenue—25% 
 • adjusted after-tax free cash flow—25% 
The Committee also developed performance ranges for each of the measures in November 2021. These 
ranges are used to determine the multiplier that is applied to 70% of each NEO’s target bonus. The 
overall financial performance multiple is equal to the weighted average of the performance multiples 
for each of these three measures. The performance multiple for each measure is zero if performance is
below the bottom of the range and varies from 35% at the low end of the range to a maximum of 200% at
the top end of the range. The Committee believes the top of each range represents extraordinary 
performance and the bottom represents satisfactory performance, below which no award would be 
provided. In addition, 30% of each NEO’s target bonus is based on performance against key strategic 
goals for the Company, called “Other Performance Factors.” We believe the mix between key financial 
and strategic factors is appropriate, given the majority of the bonus opportunity is focused on 
Company financial performance, while still recognizing the importance that Other Performance Factors 
have on establishing a successful culture that supports the Company’s strategic goals. For fiscal 
2022, with the recovery from the pandemic and our desire to deliver strong results for our 
shareholders, the Committee significantly increased performance ranges year-over-year for all three 
financial metrics. In addition, for fiscal 2022, the Committee expanded the width of the performance 
range (i.e., the difference between the maximum performance and threshold performance) for adjusted 
revenue in order to account for both upside and downside risks. The following table shows the 
performance ranges approved by the Committee for fiscal 2022 and actual performance (dollars in

Other Performance Factors The Compensation Committee developed Other Performance Factors for the 
fiscal 2022 annual bonus in November 2021. For fiscal 2022, the Other Performance Factors continued 
to emphasize the importance of diversity and inclusion, which had the highest weighting among the 
Other Performance Factors. The Committee established the following factors based on the strategic 
objectives of the Company: 
 Diversity & Inclusion – Meaningful progress building an inclusive culture through increased 
 representation, recruitment, retention and/or promotion of women and underrepresented groups 
 • globally; advance inclusive content by increasing underrepresented groups in creative hiring 
 exploring culturally diverse and authentic themes, characters and narratives; ensure 
 transparency and accountability of efforts that align with our values and advance 
 change/impact to the business 
 Collaboration on strategic priorities – Actively promote collaboration and synergy on key 
 strategic priorities of the Company with a one-company mindset and drive clear

EVALUATING PERFORMANCE The Compensation Committee reviewed the overall operating results of the 
Company in fiscal 2022, evaluating them against the bonus plan performance ranges developed by the 
Committee early in the fiscal year. The Compensation Committee approved no adjustments to actual 
fiscal 2022 total segment operating income and revenue. After-taxfree cash flow performance for 
incentive purposes was overall adjusted downward to exclude non-recurringitems, such as litigation 
proceeds and restructuring payments. In fiscal 2022, the Company achieved strong financial growth for
all three financial metrics, even after ranges were significantly increased for fiscal 2022. The 
financial performance achieved included: segment operating income of $12,121 million, revenue of 
$82,722 million and adjusted after-taxfree cash flow of $1,043 million. Based on these results and 
due to the increase in targets, the weighted financial performance factor was 159% in fiscal 2022 
compared to a performance factor of 200% in fiscal 2021. Additional details regarding the performance
of the Company are set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-Kfor fiscal 2022. With respect to the 
Other Performance Factors, the Committee recognizes that while we still have more work ahead of us, 
the NEOs delivered results on these key strategic objectives, including: Diversity & Inclusion

based bonus target multiple of salary for each of the NEOs early in the fiscal year following the

 Mr. Iger retired from the Company effective December 31, 2021. Mr. Iger was eligible for a 
 5 2022 pro-rated bonus per his employment agreement for his services during fiscal 2022. The 
 Committee awarded Mr. Iger a bonus of $4,370,000. 
The compensation set forth above and described below differs from the total compensation reported in 
the Summary Compensation Table as follows: 
 the compensation set forth above does not include the change in pension value and 
 • non-qualified deferred compensation earnings, as these items do not reflect decisions made 
 by the Committee during the fiscal year. 
28 
 the compensation set forth above does not include perquisites and benefits and other 
 • compensation, as these items are generally determined by contract and do not reflect 
 decisions made by the Committee during the fiscal year. 
The Compensation Committee’s determination on each of these matters was based on the recommendation 
of Mr. Iger (except in the case of his own and Mr. Chapek’s compensation), the parameters established
by the executive’s employment agreement and the factors described below. In determining equity 
awards, the Committee considered its overall long-term incentive guidelines for all executives, 
which, in the context of the competitive market for executive talent, attempt to balance the benefits
of incentive compensation tied to performance of the Company’s common stock with the dilutive effect 
of equity compensation awards. MR. CHAPEK

 SALARY set at the time of his promotion to Chief Executive Officer and was 
 equal to the amount set in his employment agreement.

 three times his fiscal year-end salary, as set forth in his employment 
 agreement.   The Committee determined to provide the contractually 
 required bonus at 90% of target, below that received by other NEOs. In 
 PERFORMANCE-BASED BONUS making this determination, the Committee considered the Company’s 
 strong performance against preset financial metrics, balanced with Mr. 
 Chapek’s performance, including items that contributed to Mr. Chapek’s 
 separation, discussed in the section titled “Executive Compensation — 
 Compensation Tables — Potential Payments and Rights on Termination or 
 Change in Control.” 
 The annual equity award value for Mr. Chapek reflects 60% of his total 
 EQUITY AWARD annual compensation for fiscal 2022. Mr. Chapek did not receive an

Salary.This column sets forth the base salary earned during each fiscal year. Fiscal 2020 reflects 
the voluntary reduction of the salary of NEOs in response to the COVID-19pandemic. Each of the 
Company’s NEOs serving at that time agreed to temporarily reduce their base salary, effective with 
the payroll period commencing April 5, 2020. Mr. Iger agreed to forgo his salary through the end of 
the fiscal year. Mr. Chapek agreed to forgo 50% and Ms. McCarthy agreed to forgo 30% of the base 
salary that would otherwise have been payable through August 22, 2020. Stock Awards.This column sets 
forth the grant date fair value of the restricted stock unit awards granted to the NEOs during each 
fiscal year as part of the Company’s long-term incentive compensation program. The grant date fair 
value of these awards was calculated by multiplying the number of units awarded by the average of the
high and low trading price of the Company’s common stock on the grant date, subject to valuation 
adjustments for restricted stock unit awards subject to vesting conditions other than, where 
applicable, the test to assure deductibility under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. The 
valuation adjustments for performance-based awards reflect the fact that the number of shares 
received on vesting varies based on the level of performance achieved and were determined using a 
Monte Carlo simulation that determines the probability that the performance targets will be achieved.
The grant date fair value of the restricted stock unit awards granted during fiscal 2022 is also 
included in the Fiscal 2022 Grants of Plan Based Awards Table. Option Awards.This column sets forth 
the grant date fair value of options to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock granted to the 
NEOs during each fiscal year. The grant date fair value of these options was calculated using a 
binomial option pricing model. The assumptions used in estimating the fair value of these options are
set forth in footnote 12 to the Company’s Audited Financial Statements for fiscal 2022. The grant 
date fair value of the options granted during fiscal 2022 is also included in the Fiscal 2022 Grants 
of Plan Based Awards Table. Non-EquityIncentive Plan Compensation.This column sets forth the amount 
of compensation earned by the NEOs under the Company’s annual performance-based bonus program during 
each fiscal year. A description of the Company’s annual performance-based bonus program is included 
in the section “Executive Compensation— Compensation Discussion and Analysis— Executive Compensation 
Program Structure— Objectives and Methods”and the determination of performance-based bonuses for 
fiscal 2022 is described in the section “Executive Compensation— Compensation Discussion and 
Analysis— Fiscal 2022 Compensation Decisions.”As a result of the COVID-19pandemic, fiscal 2020 
reflects the Compensation Committee’s determination to pay no bonuses to the NEOs, despite 
achievement of certain performance metrics and considerations that might have otherwise supported a 
bonus payment. Change in Pension Value and Non-QualifiedDeferred Compensation Earnings.This column 
reflects the aggregate change in the actuarial present value of each NEO’s accumulated benefits under
all defined benefit plans, including supplemental plans, during each fiscal year. The amounts 
reported in this column vary with a number of factors, including the discount rate applied to 
determine 35 
the value of future payment streams, the NEO’s age and additional earned benefits as a result of an 
additional year of service. The discount rate used pursuant to pension accounting rules to calculate 
the present value of future payments was 2.82% for fiscal 2020, 2.88% for fiscal 2021 and 5.44% for 
fiscal 2022. Neither increases nor decreases in pension value resulting from changes in the discount 
rate result in any increase or decrease in benefits payable to participants under the plan. As Mr. 
Gutierrez, Ms. Schake and Mr. Morrell all joined the Company in 2022, they are not eligible for the 
Company’s defined benefit pension. For Mr. Chapek, Ms. McCarthy, Mr. Richardson and Mr. Iger, the 
increase in interest rate for fiscal 2022 drove the change in pension value for such year to be 
negative (-$2,910,803, - $1,304,748,-$690,638 and -$5,303,886, respectively). Mr. Chapek and Ms. 
McCarthy had losses on deferred compensation as disclosed below under “ Executive Compensation — 
Compensation Tables — Fiscal 2022 Non-QualifiedDeferred Compensation Table.” All Other 
Compensation.This column sets forth all of the compensation for each fiscal year that we could not 
properly report in any other column of the table, including: 
 • the incremental cost to the Company of perquisites and other personal benefits; 
 • the amount of Company contributions to employee savings plans; 
 • the dollar value of insurance premiums paid by the Company with respect to excess liability 
 insurance for the NEOs; and 
 the dollar amount of matching charitable contributions made to charities pursuant to the 
 • Company’s charitable gift matching program, which is available to all regular U.S. employees 
 with at least one year of service. 
The dollar amount of matching charitable contributions was $27,600 for Mr. Chapek, $32,000 for Ms. 
McCarthy, $10,000 for Mr. Richardson and $65,000 for Mr. Iger. Matched amounts exceed $50,000 in a 
fiscal year if contributions for separate calendar years are made in the same fiscal year or if there
were delays in processing earlier year matches. Upon his retirement on December 31, 2021, the 
consulting period established under Mr. Iger’s then current employment agreement with the Company 
commenced. In connection with his consulting agreement, Mr. Iger received quarterly payments of 
$500,000 for each quarter he served in this capacity; for fiscal 2022 he received $1,500,000. In 
accordance with the SEC’s interpretations of its rules, this column also sets forth the incremental 
cost to the Company of certain items that are provided to the NEOs for business purposes but which 
may not be considered integrally related to duties. The following table sets forth the incremental 
cost to the Company of each other perquisite and other personal benefit that exceeded the greater of 
$25,000 or 10% of the total amount of perquisites and personal benefits for an NEO in fiscal 2022.

The incremental cost to the Company of the items specified above was determined as follows: 
 Personal air travel: the actual catering costs, landing and ramp fees, fuel costs and 
 lodging costs incurred by flight crew plus a per hour charge based on the average hourly 
 maintenance costs for the aircraft during the year for flights that were purely personal in 
 nature, and a pro-rata portion of catering costs where personal guests accompanied an NEO on 
 • flights that were business in nature. Where a personal flight coincided with the 
 repositioning of an aircraft following a business flight, only the incremental costs of the 
 flight compared to an immediate repositioning of the aircraft are included. As noted below, 
 our CEO is, and Executive Chairman was, required for security reasons to use corporate 
 aircraft for all of their personal travel. 
 • Security: the actual costs incurred by the Company for providing security services and 
 equipment. 
 • Relocation: the actual amount provided to accommodate the cost expended by Mr. Gutierrez, 
 Mr. Richardson and Mr. Morrell with regards to their relocation. 
The “Other” column in the table above includes, to the extent an NEO elected to receive any of these 
benefits, the incremental cost to the Company of the vehicle benefit, personal air travel (except for
the NEOs whose personal air travel is separately identified in the “personal air travel” column in 
the table above), reimbursement of up to $1,000 per calendar year for wellness-related purposes such 
as fitness and nutrition management, reimbursement of expenses for financial consulting and for 
officers at the vice president level and higher before October 1, 2012, a fixed monthly payment to 
offset the costs of owning and maintaining an automobile. In addition, included for Mr. Morrell is a 
$500,000 payment, paid on June 25, 2022, which was provided to account for his unique circumstances, 
including costs expended by Mr. Morrell, who was in the process of relocating his family 
internationally. The Company provides employees with benefits and perquisites based on competitive 
market conditions. All salaried employees, including the NEOs, receive the following benefits: (i) 
health care coverage; (ii) life and disability insurance protection; (iii) reimbursement of certain 
educational expenses; (iv) access to favorably priced group insurance coverage; and (v) Company 
matching of gifts of up to $25,000 per employee (and $50,000 per Senior Executive Vice President and 
Chairman directly reporting to the CEO) each calendar year to qualified charitable organizations. 
Additionally, employees at the vice president level and above, including NEOs, receive the following 
benefits, each of which involved no incremental cost to the Company: (i) complimentary access to the 
Company’s theme parks and some resort facilities; (ii) discounts on Company merchandise and resort 
facilities; and (iii) personal use of tickets acquired by the Company for business entertainment when
they become available because no business use has been arranged. 37

 Stock awards for fiscal 2022 subject to performance conditions were valued based on the 
 probability that performance targets will be achieved. Assuming the highest level of 
 performance conditions are achieved, the grant date stock award values would be $11,983,363, 
 1 $9,594,111, $6,194,014, $2,110,284, $30,275, $7,489,338 and $2,641,263 for Mr. Chapek, Ms.  
 McCarthy, Mr. Gutierrez, Mr. Richardson, Ms. Schake, Mr. Iger and Mr. Morrell, respectively, 
 for the performance-based awards made on November 30, 2021 (for Mr. Chapek, Ms. McCarthy and 
 Mr. Iger) and December 14, 2021. 
 Mr. Iger retired from the Company as Executive Chairman effective December 31, 2021. In 
 2 connection with his partial year of service for fiscal 2022, his target bonus has been 
 prorated to $3,000,000. Mr. Iger’s fiscal 2022 awards continued to vest upon his retirement. 
 Mr. Morrell received RSUs, PBUs and stock option awards in fiscal 2022. For details of Mr.  
 3 Morrell’s separation, including treatment of Mr. Morrell’s equity awards following his 
 separation from the Company, please see the section titled “Executive Compensation — 
 Compensation Tables — Potential Payments and Rights on Termination or Change in Control.”

Grant Date.The Compensation Committee made the annual grant of stock options and restricted stock 
unit awards for fiscal 2022 on December 14, 2021. As ROIC targets for fiscal 2022 were set on 
November 30, 2021, fiscal 2020 and 2021 ROIC portions were considered granted on that date. A portion
of the fiscal 2022 PBUs granted on December 14, 2021 are subject to the ROIC performance test, as 
described below. One-thirdof such units were eligible to vest based on the ROIC performance target 
established for fiscal 2022. Because the performance targets for fiscal 2023 and 2024 have not yet 
been established, the grant date value of such portion of these awards was not determinable in fiscal
2022. Therefore, the grant date fair value listed for fiscal 2022 includes only the grant date value 
of that portion of such awards subject to the 2022 ROIC target. Based on the Company’s fiscal 2022 
ROIC, 148% of the reported portion of fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021 awards will vest and 196% of the 
reported portion of fiscal 2022 awards will vest. ROIC Targets for fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024 will 
be set early each year for the remaining portion of those grants, and the grant date values for the 
remaining portions of those grants will be reported for the appropriate fiscal year when the 
applicable targets are established. Estimated Possible Payouts Under Non-EquityIncentive Plan 
Awards.As described in the section “ Executive Compensation— Compensation Discussion and Analysis,” 
the Compensation Committee sets the target bonus opportunity for the NEOs at the beginning of the 
fiscal year as a percentage of fiscal year-endsalary, and the actual bonuses for the NEOs may, except
in special circumstances such as unusual challenges or extraordinary successes, range from 35% to 
200% of the target level based on the Compensation Committee’s evaluation of financial and other 
performance factors for the fiscal year. The bonus amount may be zero if actual performance is below 
the specified threshold levels or less than the calculated amounts if the Compensation Committee 
otherwise decides to reduce the bonus. As addressed in the discussion of “ Executive Compensation— 
Compensation Discussion and Analysis,” the employment agreements of each executive officer require 
that the target used to calculate the bonus opportunity (but not the actual bonus awarded) be at 
least the amount specified in each agreement. This column shows the range of potential bonus payments
for each NEO from the threshold to the maximum based on the target range set at the beginning of the 
fiscal year. The actual bonus amounts received for fiscal 2022 are set forth in the “Non- 
EquityIncentive Plan Compensation” column of the “Fiscal 2022 Summary Compensation Table.” Estimated 
Future Payouts Under Equity Incentive Plan Awards.This column sets forth the number of restricted 
stock units awarded to the NEOs during fiscal 2022 that are subject to performance tests as described
below. These include units awarded to each of the NEOs as part of the annual grant in December 2021 
and, for Mr. Chapek, Ms. McCarthy and Mr. Iger, when fiscal 2022 ROIC targets were set with respect 
to fiscal 2020 and 2021 grants in November 2021. The vesting dates for all of the outstanding 
restricted stock unit awards held by the NEOs as of the end of fiscal 2022 are set forth in the 
“Fiscal 2022 Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-EndTable” below. All units in Row B are subject
to the following vesting conditions: Half of the units subject to the performance test are subject to
a TSR test and half of the units are subject to a ROIC test. 
 • For the half of the units subject to the TSR performance test: 
 • None of the units related to this measure vest if the Company’s TSR is below the 25th 
 percentile of the S&P 500 for that measure. 
 If the Company’s TSR is at or above the 25th percentile of the S&P 500 for the related 
 measure, the number of units related to that measure that vest will vary from 50% of the 
 • target number related to that measure (at the 25th percentile) to 100% of the target number 
 related to that measure (at the 55th percentile) to 200% of the target number related to 
 that measure (at or above the 75th percentile) (in each case, plus dividend equivalent 
 units). 
 • For the half of the units subject to the ROIC performance test: 
 • None of the units related to this measure vest if the Company’s fiscal year ROIC performance 
 in each of the applicable fiscal years is below threshold of target ROIC. 
 If the Company’s ROIC is above the threshold in any fiscal year, the number of units related 
 to that measure for that year that vest will vary from 50% of the target number related to 
 • that measure (equals threshold) to 200% of the target number related to that measure 
 (exceeds maximum) (in each case, plus dividend equivalent units). For ROIC portions from the 
 fiscal 2020 and 2021 grants, maximum payout was 150% of target. 
39 
ROIC for the Company is adjusted (i) to exclude the effect of extraordinary, unusual and/or 
nonrecurring items and (ii) to reflect such other factors, as the Committee deems appropriate to 
fairly reflect ROIC for the applicable fiscal year. 
When dividends are distributed to shareholders, dividend equivalents are credited in an amount equal 
to the dollar amount of dividends on the number of units held on the dividend record date divided by 
the fair market value of the Company’s shares of common stock on the dividend distribution date. 
Dividend equivalents vest only when, if and to the extent that the underlying units vest. 
All Other Option Awards: Number of Securities Underlying Options. This column sets forth the options 
to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock granted to the NEOs as part of the annual grant in 
December 2021. The vesting dates for these options are set forth in the “Fiscal 2022 Outstanding 
Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-EndTable” below. These options are scheduled to expire ten years after 
the date of grant. 
Exercise or Base Price of Option Awards; Grant Date Closing Price of Shares Underlying Options. These
columns set forth the exercise price for each option grant and the closing price of the Company’s 
common stock on the date of grant. The exercise price is equal to the average of the high and low 
trading price on the grant date, which may be higher or lower than the closing price on the grant 
date. 
Grant Date Fair Value of Stock and Option Awards. This column sets forth the grant date fair value of
the stock and option awards granted during fiscal 2022 calculated in accordance with applicable 
accounting requirements. The grant date fair value of all restricted stock unit awards and options is
determined as described in the section “Grant Date” above.

Number of Securities Underlying Unexercised Options: Exercisable and Unexercisable. These columns set
forth, for each NEO and for each grant made to the officer, the number of shares of the Company’s 
common stock that could be acquired upon exercise of outstanding options at the end of fiscal 2022. 
The vesting schedule for each option with unexercisable shares is shown under “Vesting Schedule” 
below. The vesting of options held by the NEOs may be accelerated in the circumstances described 
under the section “Executive Compensation — Compensation Tables — Potential Payments and Rights on 
Termination or Change in Control” below. 
Number; Market Value of Units of Stock That Have Not Vested. These columns report the number and 
market value, respectively, of shares underlying each grant of restricted stock units to each officer
that is not subject to performance vesting conditions nor the test to assure eligibility for 
deduction pursuant to Section 162(m). The number of shares includes dividend equivalent units that 
have accrued for dividends payable through October 1, 2022. The market value is equal to the number 
of shares underlying the units times the closing market price of the Company’s common stock on 
September 30, 2022, the last trading day of the Company’s fiscal year. The vesting schedule for each 
grant is shown below, with grants identified by the letter following the number of shares underlying 
the grant. Vesting of restricted stock units held by NEOs may be accelerated in the circumstances 
described under the section “Executive Compensation — Compensation Tables — Potential Payments and 
Rights on Termination or Change in Control” below. 
Number; Market Value of Unearned Units That Have Not Vested.These columns set forth the target number
and market value, respectively, of shares of the Company’s common stock underlying each restricted 
stock unit award held by each NEO that is subject to performance-based vesting conditions and/or the 
test to assure eligibility for deduction pursuant to Section 162(m). The number of shares includes 
dividend equivalent units that have accrued for dividends payable through October 1, 2022. The market
value is equal to the number of shares underlying the units multiplied by the closing market price of
the Company’s common stock on September 30, 2022, the last trading day of the Company’s fiscal year. 
The vesting schedule and performance tests and/or the test to assure eligibility under Section 162(m)
are shown in “Vesting Schedule” below. 
Vesting Schedule.The options reported above that are not yet exercisable and restricted stock unit 
awards that have not yet vested are scheduled to become exercisable and vest as set forth below. 
(A) Unless otherwise noted, stock options and restricted stock units granted before December 2020 
will vest 25% on each of the first four anniversaries of the grant date. Grants made in or after 
December 2020 will vest one-third on each of the first three anniversaries of the grant date. 
(B) Amounts may not sum to total due to rounding. 
(C) PBUs will cliff vest on the third anniversary of grant date, based on 3-year TSR versus S&P 500 
and absolute ROIC tests for each of the fiscal years in the 3-year period (targets set each year). 
Grants before 2020 for Ms. McCarthy are subject to performance under Section 162(m). 
(D) While restricted stock units will vest 25% on each of the first four anniversaries of the grant 
date for grants made before December 2020 and one-third on each of the first three anniversaries of 
the grant date for grants made in or after December 2020, grants before 2020 for Ms. McCarthy are 
also subject to a performance test to assure eligibility for deduction under Section 162(m). 
(E) Restricted stock units granted February 28, 2020 in connection with Mr. Chapek’s appointment as 
Chief Executive Officer. The units are scheduled to vest on December 17, 2022 subject to satisfaction
of a 3-year TSR test and 3 1-year ROIC tests, with the number of units vesting depending on the level
at which the tests were satisfied. 
(F) Unexercisable options will vest one-third on December 14, 2022, December 14, 2023 and December 
14, 2024. 
(G) Restricted stock units will vest one-third on December 14, 2022, December 14, 2023 and December 
14, 2024.

tests for each of the fiscal years in the 3-year period (targets set each year). 
 42 
(I) Unexercisable options will vest one-sixthon December 27, 2022, June 27, 2023, December 27, 2023, 
June 27, 2024, December 27, 2024 and June 27, 2025. (J) Restricted stock units will vest one-sixthon 
December 27, 2022, June 27, 2023, December 27, 2023, June 27, 2024, December 27, 2024 and June 27, 
2025. (K) Options granted March 21, 2019 following the close of the TFCF acquisition. The remaining 
unexercisable options are scheduled to become exercisable on December 19, 2022. Extended Vesting of 
Equity Awards Options and restricted stock units continue to vest beyond retirement (and options 
remain exercisable) if (1) they were awarded at least one year prior to the date of an employee’s 
retirement and (2) the employee was age 60 or older and had at least ten years of service on the date
such employee retired. In these circumstances: 
 Options continue to vest following retirement according to the original vesting schedule. 
 • They remain exercisable for up to five years following retirement. Options do not, however, 
 remain exercisable beyond the original expiration date of the option. 
 Restricted stock units continue to vest following retirement according to the original 
 • vesting schedule, but vesting remains subject to any applicable performance conditions 
 (except, in some cases, the test to ensure that the compensation is deductible pursuant to 
 Section 162(m)). 
In addition, the grants to Mr. Iger made in fiscal 2022 continue to vest (and options remain 
exercisable) beyond his retirement as Executive Chairman at December 31, 2021. The extended vesting 
and exercisability is not available to certain employees outside the United States. Options and 
restricted stock units awarded to executive officers with employment agreements also continue to vest
(and options remain exercisable) beyond termination of employment if the executive’s employment is 
terminated by the Company without cause or by the executive with good reason. In this case, options 
and restricted stock units continue to vest (and options remain exercisable) as though the executive 
remained employed through the end of the stated term of the employment agreement. If the executive 
would be age 60 or older and have at least ten years of service as of the end of the stated term of 
the employment agreement, the options and restricted stock units awarded at least one year prior to 
the end of the stated term of the agreement would continue to vest (and options remain exercisable) 
beyond the stated term of the employment agreement. In addition, the grants to Mr. Iger in fiscal 
2022 continue to vest (and options remain exercisable) upon his retirement at December 31, 2021.

The value realized on the exercise of options is equal to the amount per share at which the NEO sold 
shares acquired on exercise (all of which occurred on the date of exercise) minus the exercise price 
of the option times the number of shares acquired on exercise of 43 
the options. The value realized on the vesting of stock awards is equal to the closing market price 
of the Company’s common stock on the date of vesting times the number of shares acquired upon 
vesting. The number of shares and value realized on vesting includes shares that were withheld at the
time of vesting to satisfy tax withholding requirements. Equity Compensation Plans The following

 These plans are the Company’s Amended and Restated 2011 Stock Incentive Plan (“2011 Stock 
 Incentive Plan”), The Walt Disney Company/Pixar 2004 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Disney/Pixar 
 1 Plan”, which was assumed by the Company in connection with the acquisition of Pixar) and The 
 Walt Disney Company/TFCF 2013 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Disney/TFCF Plan”, which was assumed 
 by the Company in connection with the acquisition of TFCF). 
 Includes an aggregate of 17,970,581 time-based restricted stock units and PBUs. Includes an 
 2 aggregate of 23,281 restricted stock units granted under the Disney/Pixar Plan, which was 
 approved by the shareholders of Pixar prior to the Company’s acquisition. 
 Assumes shares issued upon vesting of PBUs vest at 100% of target number of units. For awards 
 3 granted in fiscal 2020 and 2021, the actual number of shares issued on vesting of PBUs could 
 be zero to 150% of the target number of PBUs. For awards granted in fiscal 2022, the actual 
 number of shares issued on vesting of PBUs could be zero to 200% of the target number of PBUs. 
 4 Reflects the weighted average exercise price of outstanding options; excludes restricted stock 
 units and PBUs. 
 Includes 382,356 securities available for future issuance under the Disney/Pixar Plan, which 
 was approved by the shareholders of Pixar prior to the Company’s acquisition. Includes 
 27,720,535 securities available for future issuance under the Disney/TFCF Plan, which was 
 5 approved by the shareholders of TFCF prior to the Company’s acquisition. Assumes all awards 
 are made in the form of options. Each award of one restricted stock unit under the 2011 Stock 
 Incentive Plan reduces the number of shares available under the plan by two, so the number of 
 securities available for issuance will be smaller to the extent awards are made as restricted 
 stock units. 
Pension Benefits The Company maintains a tax-qualified,noncontributory retirement plan, called the 
Disney Salaried Pension Plan D, for salaried employees who commenced employment before January 1, 
2012. Benefits are based on a percentage of total average monthly compensation multiplied by years of
credited service. For service years after 2012, average monthly compensation includes overtime, 
commission and regular bonus and is calculated based on the highest five consecutive years of 
compensation during the ten-yearperiod prior to termination of employment or retirement, whichever is
earlier. For service years prior to 2012, average monthly compensation considers only base salary, 
benefits were based on a somewhat higher percentage of average monthly compensation and benefits 
included a flat dollar amount based solely on years and hours of service. Retirement benefits are 
non-forfeitableafter three years of vesting service (five years of vesting service prior to 2012) or 
at age 65 after one year of service. Actuarially reduced benefits are paid to participants whose 
benefits are non-forfeitableand who retire before age 65 but on or after age 55. The early retirement
reduction is 50% at age 55, decreasing to 0% at age 65. In calendar year 2022, the maximum 
compensation limit under a tax-qualifiedplan was $305,000 and the maximum annual benefit that may be 
accrued under a tax-qualifieddefined benefit plan was $245,000. To provide additional retirement 
benefits for key salaried employees, the Company maintains a supplemental non-qualified,unfunded 
plan, the Amended and Restated Key Plan, 44 
which provides retirement benefits in excess of the compensation limitations and maximum benefit 
accruals under tax-qualifiedplans. Under this plan, benefits are calculated in the same manner as 
under the Disney Salaried Pension Plan D, including the differences in benefit determination for 
years before and after January 1, 2012, described above, except as follows: 
 starting on January 1, 2017, average annual compensation used for calculating benefits under 
 • the plans for any participant was capped at the greater of $1,000,000 or the participant’s 
 average annual compensation determined as of January 1, 2017; and 
 benefits for persons who were NEOs on January 1, 2012 are limited to the amount the 
 executive officer would have received had the plan in effect prior to its January 1, 2012 
 • amendment continued without change. 
 ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── 
Company employees who either transferred to the Company from ABC, Inc. after the Company’s 
acquisition of ABC or worked for a legacy ABC company (e.g., ESPN) are also eligible to receive 
benefits under the Disney Salaried Pension Plan A (formerly known as the ABC, Inc. Retirement Plan) 
and a Benefit Equalization Plan, which, like the Amended and Restated Key Plan, provides eligible 
participants retirement benefits in excess of the compensation limits and maximum benefit accruals 
that apply to tax-qualifiedplans. Mr. Iger received credited years of service under those plans for 
the years prior to the Company’s acquisitions of ABC, Inc. A term of the 1995 purchase agreement 
between ABC, Inc. and the Company provides that employees transferring employment to coverage under a
Disney pension plan will receive an additional benefit under Disney plans equal to (a) the amount the
employee would receive under the Disney pension plans if all of the employee’s ABC service were 
counted under the Disney pension less (b) the combined benefits the employee receives under the ABC 
plan (for service prior to the transfer) and the Disney plan (for service after the transfer). Mr. 
Iger transferred from ABC and Mr. Richardson worked for a legacy ABC company and, as such, each 
receives a pension benefit under the Disney plans to bring the employee’s total benefit up to the 
amount the employee would have received if all the employee’s years of service had been credited 
under the Disney plans. The effect of these benefits is reflected in the present value of benefits 
under the Disney plans in the table below. As of the end of fiscal 2022, Mr. Chapek and Mr. 
Richardson were eligible for early retirement; Ms. McCarthy was eligible for retirement and Mr. Iger 
had elected retirement. Fiscal 2022 Pension Benefits Table The following table sets forth the present

These present values assume that each NEO retires at age 65 (or their age on October 1, 2022, if 
older) for purposes of the Disney Salaried Pension Plan D and the Amended and Restated Key Plan, and 
age 62 (or their age on October 1, 2022, if older) for purposes of the Disney Salaried Pension Plan A
and the Benefit Equalization Plan of ABC, Inc. Age 65 is the normal retirement age under each of the 
plans and is also the age at which unreduced benefits are payable, except the earliest age at which 
unreduced benefits are payable under the ABC plans is age 62 for service years prior to 2012. The 
values also assume a straight life-annuity payment for an unmarried participant. Participants may 
elect other actuarially reduced forms of payment, such as joint and survivor benefits and payment of 
benefits for a period certain irrespective of the death of the participant. The present values were 
calculated using the 5.44% discount rate assumption set forth in footnote 10 to the Company’s Audited
Financial Statements for fiscal 2022 and using actuarial factors including Pri-2012annuitant 
mortality table, projected generationally with a modified version of the MP-2019scale for males and 
females. The present values reported in the table are not available as lump sum payments under the 
plans. Fiscal 2022 Non-QualifiedDeferred Compensation Table Under the Company’s Non-QualifiedDeferred
Compensation Plan, U.S.-based executives at the level of Vice President or above may defer a portion 
of their compensation and applicable taxes with an opportunity to earn a tax-deferredreturn on the 
deferred amounts. The plan gives eligible executives the opportunity to defer up to 50% of their base
salary and up to 100% of their annual performance-based bonus award until retirement or termination 
of employment or, at the executive’s election, until an earlier date at least five years following 
the date the compensation is earned. The Company also has the option to make a contribution into an 
executive’s deferred compensation account on terms and subject to any conditions (such as vesting 
conditions) the Company chooses. Amounts in an executive’s deferred account earn a return based on 
the executive’s election among a series of mutual funds designated by the Company, which are 
generally the same funds available under the Company’s qualified deferred compensation plans. Returns
on the funds available for the deferred account ranged from -30.55%to 0.68% for the year ended 
October 1, 2022. The deferred amounts and any deemed earnings on the amounts are not actual 
investments and are obligations of the Company. Ms. McCarthy participated in this plan in fiscal 2022
and her contributions and aggregate earnings during the fiscal year and aggregate balance at the end 
of the fiscal year are reflected in the table below. Ms. McCarthy’s contributions represent deferred 
salary in the amount of $989,231 and bonus in the amount of $5,565,846. Mr. Chapek had a negative 
return on the year, but he did not make a contribution in fiscal 2022. From 2000 through 2005, 
$500,000 per year of Mr. Iger’s annual base salary was deferred. The interest rate is adjusted 
annually in March and the weighted average interest rate for fiscal 2022 was 1.118%. There were no 
additions during the fiscal year to the deferred amount by either the Company or Mr. Iger other than 
these earnings and no withdrawals during the fiscal year. In connection with his retirement, and in 
order to avoid the imposition of an additional tax on Mr. Iger under Section 409A of the Internal 
Revenue Code, Mr. Iger was paid $4,569,183 on July 1, 2022. With this payment, Mr. Iger no longer has
an outstanding non-qualifieddeferred compensation balance.

Potential Payments and Rights on Termination or Change in Control Our NEOs may receive compensation 
in connection with termination of their employment. This compensation is payable pursuant to (a) the 
terms of compensation plans applicable by their terms to all participating employees and (b) the 
terms of employment agreements with each of our NEOs. During fiscal 2022, we had employment 
agreements with our NEOs with the following end dates: June 30, 2025 for Mr. Chapek, June 30, 2024 
for Ms. McCarthy, December 31, 2024 for Mr. Gutierrez, June 30, 2024 for Mr. Richardson, June 29, 
2025 for Ms. Schake, December 31, 2021 for Mr. Iger and December 31, 2024 for Mr. Morrell. As Mr. 
Iger retired from the Company as Executive Chairman before fiscal year end, he was not entitled to 
termination payments as of October 1, 2022. In fiscal 2023, the Company entered into a new employment
agreement with Mr. Iger as Chief Executive Officer with an end date of December 31, 2024. In June 
2022, the Board agreed to extend Mr. Chapek’s employment agreement based on Mr. Chapek’s work 
navigating the Company through the unprecedented challenges of the pandemic and growing the Company’s
streaming business. The Board continued to spend significant time discussing the leadership of the 
Company in the months that followed and determined that Mr. Chapek was no longer the right person to 
serve in the CEO role. The significant developments and change in the broader macroeconomic 
environment over this period informed how the Board viewed the appropriate leader in light of the 
rapidly evolving industry and market dynamics. The Board therefore concluded that, as Disney embarks 
on an increasingly complex period of industry transformation, Mr. Iger is best situated to lead the 
Company while an appropriate longer-term successor is identified. On November 20, 2022 (after fiscal 
2022), the Board decided to exercise its right to terminate Mr. Chapek’s employment without cause. In
connection with this termination, in the event that Mr. Chapek successfully completes all of the 
terms of his post-employment consulting agreement and does not violate the terms of the employment 
agreement that survive his termination or the general release, Mr. Chapek’s severance would strictly 
conform to the terms of his employment agreement such that he would be entitled to the following cash
termination payments: 
 • $6,527,397 in remaining base salary through the scheduled expiration date of his employment 
 agreement, as amended; and 
 • $1,027,397 equivalent to a pro-rated target bonus for fiscal 2023. 
Although the Company made the unilateral decision to exercise its right to terminate Mr. Morrell’s 
employment during fiscal 2022, Mr. Morrell was not entitled to termination payments during fiscal 
2022. In the event that Mr. Morrell successfully completes all of the terms of his post-employment 
consulting agreement and general release, he would be entitled to the following cash based payments: 
 • $2,506,849 in remaining base salary through the end of his original employment agreement 
 term; 
47 
 • $1,500,000 equivalent to a target bonus for fiscal 2022; and 
 a buyout of the home Mr. Morrell purchased in Southern California. Consistent with past 
 relocation practices for unique circumstances, a third-party vendor purchased Mr. Morrell’s 
 property on the Company’s behalf in June 2022 for the same price at which the property was 
 originally purchased. The Company will go through the sale process and realize any gains or 
 losses on the sale of the property. In no situation will Mr. Morrell monetarily benefit from 
 the sale of the property. As of October 1, 2022 and the date of the filing of this report, 
 • the property has not been sold. 
 ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── 
The treatment of the equity awards held by Mr. Chapek and Mr. Morrell at their respective termination
dates under their employment agreements is described below in the section titled “ Executive 
Compensation — Compensation Tables — Termination Pursuant to Company Termination Right Other Than For
Cause or By Executive For Good Reason.” It is the standard practice of the Compensation Committee to 
only approve termination payments for a senior executive within the obligations of the Company’s 
plans and current employment agreements. The Committee approved the termination payments and 
conditions for Mr. Morrell due to unique factors specific to his situation that involved an 
international move for Mr. Morrell and his family. This decision was made in the best interest of the
Company and, we believe, will mitigate further disruption to the Company. The termination provisions 
included in our executive officers’ employment agreements serve a variety of purposes, including: 
providing the benefits of equity incentive plans to the executive and the executive’s family in case 
of death or disability; defining when the executive may be terminated with cause and receive no 
further compensation; and clearly defining rights in the event of a termination in other 
circumstances. The availability, nature and amount of compensation on termination differ depending on
whether employment terminates because of: 
 • death or disability; 
 • the Company’s termination of the executive pursuant to the Company’s termination right or 
 the executive’s decision to terminate because of action the Company takes or fails to take; 
 • the Company’s termination of the executive for cause; or 
 • expiration of an employment agreement, retirement or other voluntary termination. 
The compensation that each of our NEOs may receive under each of these termination circumstances is 
described below. It is important to note that the amounts of compensation set forth in the tables 
below are based on the specific assumptions noted and do not predict the actual compensation that our
NEOs would receive. Actual compensation received would be a function of a number of factors that are 
unknowable at this time, including: the date of the executive’s termination of employment; the 
executive’s base salary at the time of termination; the executive’s age and service with the Company 
at the time of termination; and, because many elements of the compensation are performance-based 
pursuant to the Company’s compensation philosophy described in “ Executive Compensation — 
Compensation Discussion and Analysis” above, the future performance of the Company. Moreover, the 
option and restricted stock unit acceleration amounts in case of a termination without cause or by 
the executive for good reason assume that these awards immediately accelerate, which is not the case 
in the absence of a change in control. Rather, options and units continue to vest over time and in 
most cases are subject to the same performance measures that apply if there had been no termination. 
(The performance measures do not apply to vesting of restricted stock unit awards when termination is
due to death or disability and the test to assure deductibility under Section 162(m) does not apply 
if it is not necessary to preserve deductibility.) In each of the circumstances described below, our 
NEOs are eligible to receive earned, unpaid salary through the date of termination and benefits that 
are unconditionally accrued as of the date of termination pursuant to policies applicable to all 
employees. This includes the deferred compensation and earnings on these deferred amounts as 
described under the “Fiscal 2022 Non-QualifiedDeferred Compensation Table.”This earned compensation 
is not described or quantified below because these amounts represent earned, vested benefits that are
not contingent on the termination of employment, but we do describe and quantify benefits that 
continue beyond the date of termination that are in addition to those provided for in the applicable 
benefit plans. The executive’s accrued benefits include the pension benefits described under 
“Executive Compensation — Compensation Tables — Pension Benefits,”which become payable to all 
participants who have reached retirement age. Because they have reached early retirement or 
retirement age under the plans, Mr. Chapek, Ms. McCarthy and Mr. Richardson would have been eligible 
to receive these benefits if 48 
their employment had terminated at the end of fiscal 2022. Because the pension benefits do not differ
from those described under “Executive Compensation — Compensation Tables — Pension Benefits”except in
ways that are equally applicable to all salaried employees, the nature and amount of their pension 
benefits are not described or quantified below. DEATH AND DISABILITY The employment agreement of each
NEO provides for payment of any unpaid bonus for any fiscal year that had been completed at the time 
of the executive’s death or termination of employment due to disability. The amount of the bonus will
be determined by the Compensation Committee using the same criteria used for determining a bonus as 
if the executive remained employed. In addition to the compensation and rights in employment 
agreements, the 2011 Stock Incentive Plan and award agreements thereunder provide that all options 
awarded to a participant (including the NEOs) become fully exercisable upon the death or disability 
of the participant and remain exercisable for 18 months in the case of death and 12 months in the 
case of disability (or 18 months in the case of participants who are eligible for immediate 
retirement benefits or 36 to 60 months, depending on the original grant date, in the case of 
participants who would at the time of termination due to disability be over 60 years of age and have 
at least ten years of service and where the options have been outstanding for one year at such time),
and if the performance measurement has not been made at the time of death or disability, all 
restricted stock units awarded to the participant under the 2011 Stock Incentive Plan will, to the 
extent the units had not previously been forfeited, fully vest and become payable upon the death or 
disability of the participant. If a performance measurement has been made at the time of death or 
disability with respect to restricted stock units, the restricted stock units will vest and 
accelerate based on the performance measurement. The following table sets forth the value of the 
estimated payments and benefits each of our NEOs would have received under our compensation plans and
their employment agreements if their employment had terminated at the close of business on the last 
day of fiscal 2022 as a result of death or disability. The value of option acceleration is equal to 
the difference between the $94.33 closing market price of shares of the Company’s common stock on 
September 30, 2022 (the last trading day in fiscal 2022) and the weighted average exercise price of 
options with an exercise price less than the market price times the number of shares subject to such 
options that would accelerate as a result of termination. The value of restricted stock unit 
acceleration is equal to the $94.33 closing market price of shares of the Company’s common stock on 
September 30, 2022 multiplied by the number of units that would accelerate as a result of 
termination, which, for PBUs, is equal to the target number of units.

 Paul J. Richardson 1,670,000 — 1,992,910 
 Kristina K. Schake 1,320,000 — 2,069,412 
 This amount is equal to the bonus awarded to the NEOs with respect to fiscal 2022 and set 
 forth in the “Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation” column of the “Fiscal 2022 Summary 
 1 Compensation Table”. In fiscal 2022, Mr. Chapek was entitled to receive compensation under the 
 annual performance-based bonus program pursuant to his employment agreement because his 
 termination occurred after the end of the fiscal year. 
TERMINATION PURSUANT TO COMPANY TERMINATION RIGHT OTHER THAN FOR CAUSE OR BY EXECUTIVE FOR GOOD 
REASON The employment agreement with each NEO provides that the executive officer will receive a 
bonus for any fiscal year that had been completed at the time of termination of employment if the 
executive officer’s employment is terminated by the Company pursuant to the Company’s termination 
right other than for cause (as described below) or by the NEO with good reason (as described below). 
The amount of the bonus will be determined by the Compensation Committee using the same criteria used
for determining a bonus if the executive remained employed. 49 
In addition, each NEO’s employment agreement provides that the NEO will receive the following 
compensation and rights conditioned on the NEO executing a general release of claims and agreeing to 
provide the Company with consulting services for a period of six months after the NEO’s termination 
(or, if shorter, until the employment agreement expiration date): 
 A lump sum payment equal to the base salary the NEO would have earned had the NEO remained 
 • employed during the term of the NEO’s consulting agreement, paid six months and one day 
 after termination. 
 If the consulting agreement was terminated other than as a result of the NEO’s material 
 breach of the consulting agreement, a further lump sum payment equal to the base salary the 
 • NEO would have earned had the NEO remained employed after the termination of the NEO’s 
 consulting agreement and until the employment agreement expiration date, paid six months and 
 one day after termination of employment. 
 • A bonus for the year in which the NEO is terminated equal to a pro-rata portion of a target 
 bonus amount determined in accordance with the employment agreement. 
 All options that had vested as of the termination date or were scheduled to vest no later 
 than three months after the employment agreement expiration date will remain or become 
 exercisable as though the NEO were employed until that date. The options will remain 
 exercisable until the earlier of (a) the scheduled expiration date of the options and (b)  
 three months after the employment agreement expiration date. In addition, as is true for all 
 employees, options awarded at least one year before termination will continue to vest and 
 • will remain exercisable until the earlier of the expiration date of the option and five 
 years after the termination date if the officer would have attained age 60 and have 
 completed at least ten years of service as of that date. Pursuant to employment agreements 
 with each of the NEOs, the termination date for these purposes will be deemed to be the 
 employment agreement expiration date. For any employee that is eligible for immediate 
 retirement benefits, options awarded within, but less than, one year of termination will 
 vest to the extent they are scheduled to vest within three months of termination and will 
 remain exercisable for 18 months following termination. 
 All restricted stock units that were scheduled to vest prior to the employment agreement 
 expiration date will vest as though the NEO were employed until that date to the extent 
 applicable performance tests are met (but any test to assure deductibility of compensation 
 under Section 162(m) will be waived for any units scheduled to vest after the fiscal year in 
 which the termination of employment occurs unless application of the test is necessary to 
 • preserve deductibility). As is true for all employees, restricted stock units awarded at 
 least one year before termination will continue to vest through the end of the vesting 
 schedule to the extent applicable performance criteria are met if the officer would be over 
 60 years of age and have at least ten years of service as of the termination date. Pursuant 
 to employment agreements with each of the NEOs, the termination date for these purposes will 
 be deemed to be the employment agreement expiration date. 
The employment agreements provide that the Company has the right to terminate the NEO’s employment 
subject to payment of the foregoing compensation in its sole, absolute and unfettered discretion for 
any reason or no reason whatsoever. A termination for cause does not constitute an exercise of this 
right and would be subject to the compensation provisions described below under the section “— 
Termination for Cause.” The employment agreements provide that an NEO can terminate the NEO’s 
employment for “good reason” following notice to the Company within three months of the NEO having 
actual notice of the occurrence of any of the following events (except that the Company will have 30 
days after receipt of the notice to cure the conduct specified in the notice): (i) a reduction in the
NEO’s base salary, annual target bonus opportunity or (where applicable) annual target long-term 
incentive award opportunity; (ii) the removal from the NEO’s position; (iii) a material reduction in 
the NEO’s duties and responsibilities; (iv) the assignment to the NEO of duties that are materially 
inconsistent with the NEO’s position or duties or that materially impair the NEO’s ability to 
function in the NEO’s office; (v) relocation of the NEO’s principal office to a location that is more
than 50 miles outside of the greater Los Angeles area; or (vi) a material breach of any material 
provision of the NEO’s employment agreement by the Company. 50 
An NEO (or any employee holding equity awards) can also terminate for “good reason” after a change in
control (as defined in the 2011 Stock Incentive Plan) if, within 12 months following the change in 
control, a “triggering event” occurs and in that case the 2011 Stock Incentive Plan provides that any
outstanding options, restricted stock units, PBUs or other plan awards will generally become fully 
vested and, in certain cases, paid to the plan participant. A “triggering event” is defined to 
include: (a) a termination of employment by the Company other than for death, disability or “cause;” 
or (b) a termination of employment by the participant following a reduction in position, pay or other
“constructive termination.” Under the 2011 Stock Incentive Plan, “cause” has the same meaning as in 
the NEO’s employment agreement, as defined below under “— Termination for Cause.” Any such payments 
that become subject to the excess parachute tax rules may be reduced in certain circumstances. Each 
NEO’s employment agreement specifies that any compensation resulting from subsequent employment will 
not be offset against amounts described above. The following table provides a quantification of 
benefits (as calculated in the following paragraph) each of the NEOs would have received if their 
employment had been terminated at the end of fiscal 2022 (under their employment agreements as in 
effect at that time) by the Company pursuant to its termination right or by the executive with good 
reason. The “option valuation” amount is (a) the difference between the $94.33 closing market price 
of shares of the Company’s common stock on September 30, 2022 and the weighted average exercise price
of options with an exercise price less than the market price times (b) the number of options with in-
the-moneyexercise prices that would become exercisable despite the termination. The “restricted stock
unit valuation” amount is the $94.33 closing market price on September 30, 2022, times the target 
number of units that could vest. However, as described above, options do not become immediately 
exercisable and restricted stock units do not immediately vest (and would eventually vest only to the
extent applicable performance conditions are met) absent a change in control. The actual value 
realized from the exercise of the options and the vesting of restricted stock units may therefore be 
more or less than the amount shown below depending on changes in the market price of the Company’s 
common stock and the satisfaction of applicable performance tests.

 This amount is equal to the bonus awarded to the NEOs with respect to fiscal 2022 and set 
 1 forth in the “Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation” column of the “Fiscal 2022 Summary 
 Compensation Table,” plus the lump sum payments based on salary through the end of the 
 employment term as described above. 
51 
 While this is the payment Mr. Chapek would have earned had he been separated at the end of 
 fiscal 2022, the actual cash amounts to which he is actually entitled are described under the 
 section titled “Executive Compensation — Compensation Tables — Potential Payments and Rights 
 2 on Termination or Change in Control” in connection with his separation. In fiscal 2022, Mr.  
 Chapek was entitled to receive compensation under the annual performance-based bonus program 
 pursuant to his employment agreement because his termination occurred after the end of the 
 fiscal year. 
 This amount represents the estimated values that would have been ascribed to the enhanced 
 vesting of his outstanding equity awards had Mr. Chapek been separated at the end of fiscal 
 2022. However, because these awards will continue to vest on the same basis as though Mr.  
 Chapek had remained employed, the values that will actually derive will be based on the value 
 of the underlying shares if and when they become vested or exercisable. Moreover, because Mr.  
 Chapek had attained age 60 and completed 10 years of service, had Mr. Chapek retired upon 
 November 20, 2022, all of the equity awards taken into account in the above table, except 
 those granted in fiscal 2022, would nonetheless have remained outstanding and eligible to vest 
 3 as though he remained employed under the policies generally applicable to retirement. 
 ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── 
TERMINATION FOR CAUSE Each NEO’s employment agreement provides that, if the NEO’s employment is 
terminated by the Company for cause, the NEO will only be eligible to receive the compensation earned
and benefits vested through the date of such termination of employment, including any rights the NEO 
may have under the NEO’s indemnification agreement with the Company or the equity plans of the 
Company. “Termination for Cause” is defined in each NEO’s employment agreements as termination by the
Company due to gross negligence, gross misconduct, willful nonfeasance or willful material breach of 
the agreement by the executive unless, if the Company determines that the conduct or cause is 
curable, such conduct or cause is timely cured by the NEO. EXPIRATION OF EMPLOYMENT TERM; RETIREMENT 
Each of the NEOs is eligible to receive earned, unpaid salary and unconditionally vested accrued 
benefits (including continued vesting of restricted stock units and vesting and exercisability of 
options awarded more than one year prior to retirement if they are over 60 years of age with at least
ten years of service) if the NEO’s employment terminates at the expiration of the NEO’s employment 
agreement or the NEO otherwise retires, but except as described below, they are not contractually 
entitled to any additional compensation in this circumstance. Under the terms of Mr. Iger’s 
employment agreement as in effect at December 31, 2021, to enable the Company to have access to Mr. 
Iger’s unique skills, knowledge and experience with regard to the media and entertainment business 
and his institutional knowledge of the Company and its strategic evolution, upon his retirement, Mr. 
Iger was to serve as a consultant to the Company for a period of five years. In this capacity, Mr. 
Iger would provide assistance, up to certain specified monthly and annual maximum time commitments, 
on such matters as his successor as Chief Executive Officer may request from time to time. In 
consideration of his consulting services, Mr. Iger is to receive a quarterly fee of $500,000 for each
of the quarters of this five-year period. For the five years following termination of employment, the
Company would also provide Mr. Iger with the same security services (other than the personal use of a
Company-provided or Company-leased aircraft) as it has made available to him as Chief Executive 
Officer. Under his employment agreement entered into on November 20, 2022, upon the re-commencementof
his employment, the parties’ obligations in respect of these post-employment commitments are 
suspended and will resume to be fulfilled for the remaining term when Mr. Iger again terminates his 
employment with the Company. Other NEO employment agreements each provide that the Chief Executive 
Officer will recommend to the Compensation Committee an annual cash bonus for the fiscal year in 
which their respective employment agreements end based on the executive’s contributions during that 
fiscal year. As in the case of a termination under the Company’s termination right other than for 
cause or the executive’s right to terminate for good reason, vested options and restricted stock 
units will remain exercisable for 18 months for executives eligible to receive retirement benefits, 
and options and restricted stock units outstanding for at least one year will continue to vest, and 
options will 52 
remain exercisable, for up to three or five years (depending on the original grant date) if the NEO 
was age 60 or greater and had at least ten years of service at the date of retirement. In addition, 
under the terms of his employment agreement as in effect at December 31, 2021, the equity grants made
to Mr. Iger in fiscal 2022 became eligible to continue to vest (and options remain exercisable) upon 
his retirement at December 31, 2021. Pay Ratio In accordance with SEC rules, we are providing the 
ratio of the annual total compensation of our Chief Executive Officer to the annual total 
compensation of the Company’s median employee. The ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a 
manner consistent with SEC rules and the methodology described below. Per SEC rules, the Company is 
permitted to use the same median employee as was used in fiscal 2021. However, since the median 
employee used for the past two years has separated from the Company, we have conducted an analysis 
and selected a similarly situated employee. Our methodology to confirm the median employee is 
consistent with last year. We reviewed the annual base salary of the global workforce as of the last 
business day of the fiscal year, October 1, 2022. Due to population size, we identified a band of 
employees with a base salary that approximates the median base salary for the Company. The median 
base salary reflects a workforce with large populations of seasonal, part-time and international 
employees working in multiple, distinct lines of business. We calculated the median employee’s total 
annual compensation for fiscal 2022 (which consisted of an increase to base salary, overtime pay and 
the Company’s contribution to health insurance premiums) and ensured the median employee’s 
compensation did not contain distortive compensation features (e.g., abnormal amounts of overtime, 
special premium pay or commissions/tips, etc.). The median Disney employee works in a full-time 
hourly role in parks and has been with the Company for over eleven years. For fiscal 2022, the median
employee’s total annual compensation was $54,256. Mr. Chapek’s total annual compensation, including 
the Company’s contribution to health insurance premiums (which are not included in the Fiscal 2022 
Summary Compensation Tablein this report), was $24,198,254. The ratio of these amounts was 446:1. 
Other Compensation Information Risk Management Considerations The Compensation Committee believes 
that the following features of performance-based bonus and equity programs appropriately incentivize 
the creation of long-term shareholder value while discouraging behavior that could lead to excessive 
risk: 
 Financial Performance Measures. The financial metrics used to determine the amount of an 
 • executive’s bonus are measures the Committee believes drive long-term shareholder value. The 
 ranges set for these measures are intended to reward success without encouraging excessive 
 risk-taking. 
 Limit on Bonus. The overall bonus opportunity is not expected to exceed two times the target 
 • amount, no matter how much financial performance exceeds the ranges established at the 
 beginning of the fiscal year. 
 Equity Vesting Periods. Performance-based stock units generally vest in three years. 
 • Time-based stock units and options vest annually for up to four years and options remain 
 exercisable for ten years. These periods are designed to reward sustained performance over 
 several periods, rather than performance in a single period. 
 Equity Retention Guidelines. NEOs are required to acquire within five years of becoming an 
 executive officer and hold as long as they are executive officers of the Company, shares 
 (including restricted stock units) having a value of at least three times their base salary 
 • amounts, or five times in the case of the Chief Executive Officer. If these levels have not 
 been reached, these officers are required to retain ownership of shares representing at 
 least 75% of the net after-tax gain (100% in the case of the Chief Executive Officer) 
 realized on exercise of options for a minimum of twelve months. 
53 
 No Hedging or Pledging. The Company’s insider trading compliance program prohibits members 
 of the Board of Directors, NEOs and all other employees subject to the Company’s insider 
 • trading compliance program from entering into any transaction designed to hedge, or having 
 the effect of hedging, the economic risk of owning the Company’s securities and prohibits 
 certain persons, including members of the Board of Directors and the NEOs, from pledging 
 Company securities. 
 Clawback Policy. If the Company is required to restate its financial results due to material 
 noncompliance with financial reporting requirements under the securities laws as a result of 
 • misconduct by an executive officer, applicable law permits the Company to recover incentive 
 compensation from that executive officer (including profits realized from the sale of 
 Company securities). In such a situation, the Board of Directors would exercise its business 
 judgment to determine what action it believes is appropriate. 
Action may include recovery or cancellation of any bonus or incentive payments made to an executive 
on the basis of having met or exceeded performance targets during a period of fraudulent activity or 
a material misstatement of financial results if the Board determines that such recovery or 
cancellation is appropriate due to intentional misconduct by the executive officer that resulted in 
performance targets being achieved that would not have been achieved absent such misconduct. Under 
the 2011 Stock Incentive Plan approved at the Company’s 2020 Annual Meeting, equity awards pursuant 
to the plan may be clawed back where there is reputational or financial harm to the Company, even in 
the absence of a restatement. Equity awards are generally approved on dates the Compensation 
Committee meets. Committee meetings are normally scheduled well in advance and are not scheduled with
an eye to announcements of material information regarding the Company. The Committee may make an 
award with an effective date in the future, including awards contingent on commencement of 
employment, execution of a new employment agreement or some other subsequent event, or may act by 
unanimous written consent on the date of such an event when the proposed issuances have been reviewed
by the Committee prior to the date of the event. At the Compensation Committee’s request, management 
conducted its annual assessment of the risk profile of our compensation programs in December 2022. 
The assessment included an inventory of the compensation programs at each of the Company’s segments 
and an evaluation of whether any program contained elements that created risks that could have a 
material adverse impact on the Company. Management provided the results of this assessment to Pay 
Governance LLC, the Committee’s compensation consultant, which evaluated the findings and reviewed 
them with the Committee. As a result of this review, the Committee determined that the risks arising 
from the Company’s policies and practices are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect
on the Company. 54 
Peer Groups SUMMARY OF PEER GROUPS The following graph summarizes the three distinct peer groups we 
use for three distinct purposes and the companies that met these criteria and were included at the 
beginning of fiscal 2022, described in more detail below: 
 General Industry Peers 
 • Alphabet, Inc. • 
 Amazon.com, Inc. • 
 Apple, Inc. • AT&T Inc. 
 • Charter 
 Communications, Inc. • 
 Cisco Systems • 
 Comcast Corporation •

 1 In April 2022, Discovery Inc. completed its 
 acquisition of the WarnerMedia assets from AT&T 
 and became Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. 
MEDIA INDUSTRY PEERS The media industry peer group helps evaluate compensation levels for the NEOs. 
The Compensation Committee believes that there is a limited pool of talent with the set of creative 
and organizational skills needed to run a global creative organization like the Company. The 
Committee also understands that executives with the background needed to manage a company such as 
ours have career options with compensation opportunities that normally exceed those available in most
other industries, and that compensation levels within the peer group are driven by the dynamics of 
compensation in the entertainment industry and not the ownership structure of a particular company. 
Accordingly, the market for executive talent to lead the Company, and the group against which to 
compare our executive compensation, is best represented by the companies in our media industry peer 
group. GENERAL INDUSTRY PEERS The general industry peer group helps evaluate general compensation 
structure, policies and practices. The Compensation Committee believes that the features of the 
Company’s overall compensation structure, policies and practices should normally be consistent for 
all executives. Because our operations span multiple industries, the Committee believes that a 
consistent approach across the breadth of the Company’s operations with respect to features of our 
overall executive compensation structure is best achieved by reference to a group of General Industry
Peers that is broader than the Media Industry Peers. The peer group used for establishing 
compensation structure, policies and practices consists of companies that have: 
 • A consumer orientation and/or strong brand recognition; 
 • A global presence and operations; 
 • Annual revenue no less than 40% and no more than two and a half times our annual revenue; 
 and 
55 
 • As a general matter, a market capitalization in the range of approximately one-quarter to 
 four times our market capitalization. 
Additionally, the general industry peer group includes companies that do not meet the revenue or 
market cap test, but that are included in the peer groups used by one or more of the Media Industry 
Peers. PERFORMANCE PEERS The performance peers help evaluate relative economic performance of the 
Company. The overall financial performance of the Company is driven by the Company’s diverse 
businesses, which compete in multiple sectors of the overall market. The Compensation Committee 
believes that, given the span of the Company’s businesses, the best measure of relative performance 
is how the Company’s diverse businesses have fared in the face of the economic trends that impact 
companies in the overall market and that the best benchmark for measuring such success is the 
Company’s relative performance compared to that of the companies comprising the S&P 500. Accordingly,
the Committee has selected the S&P 500 to set the context for evaluating the Company’s performance 
and to measure relative performance for PBU awards. CHANGES FOR FISCAL 2023 Advised by its 
independent compensation consultant, the Compensation Committee reviewed the criteria for selecting 
members of the Company’s peer groups during fiscal 2022 and made the following changes for fiscal 
2023: 
 • With AT&T’s divestiture of its Media assets, the Company moved AT&T from the media industry 
 peer group to the general industry peer group. 
 Given their primary focus on IT hardware/semiconductors more strongly oriented toward 
 • business-to-business sales, the Committee removed Cisco and Intel from the general industry 
 peer group. 
 As it reflects a prominent global brand with strong consumer orientation and a broadening 
 • focus on digital sales and applications, the Committee added NIKE, Inc. to the general 
 industry peer group. 
The Committee will continue to monitor the competitive landscapes in which the Company’s various 
business units operate and implement changes to the peer group as it deems appropriate. Deductibility
of Compensation For taxable years commencing after 2017, Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code 
generally disallows a tax deduction to public corporations for compensation over $1 million paid to 
any person whose compensation was required to be included in this report for any fiscal year after 
2016 because such person was either the Company’s Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer 
or was one of the Company’s three other most highly compensated executive officers for such fiscal 
year. Accordingly, to the extent that compensation in excess of $1 million is payable to any such 
person in any fiscal year after fiscal 2018, such excess amount is likely to be non-deductibleby the 
Company for federal income tax purposes. However, Section 162(m) exempts qualifying performance-based
compensation paid after fiscal 2018 pursuant to a binding written agreement in effect on November 2, 
2017. Thus, performance-based awards that were outstanding on that date or awarded thereafter 
pursuant to a binding written agreement can be exempt from the deduction limit if applicable 
requirements are met. For fiscal 2022, none of the executive officers served under employment 
agreements that were in place without amendment prior to November 2, 2017. However, awards to 
executive officers under the annual performance-based bonus program and the long-term incentive 
program that were (i) granted prior to November 2, 2017, or (ii) may continue to qualify for the 
exemption because they were granted pursuant to a binding written agreement in effect on such date, 
have been or will be made payable or vest subject to achievement of a performance test based on 
adjusted net income in order to qualify for the exemption from Section 162(m), to the extent 
available. If this test is satisfied, the additional performance tests described in the Compensation 
Discussion and Analysisare applied to determine the actual payout of such bonuses and awards, which 
in order to remain deductible may not be more than the maximum level funded based on achievement of 
the Section 162(m) test. Adjusted net income means net income adjusted, as appropriate, to exclude 
the following items or variances: change in accounting principles; acquisitions; dispositions of a 
business; asset impairments; restructuring 56 
charges; extraordinary, unusual or infrequent items; and extraordinary litigation costs and insurance
recoveries. For fiscal 2022, the adjusted net income target was $2.5 billion and the Company achieved
adjusted net income of $6.4 billion. Net income was adjusted to account for transaction purchase 
accounting, restructuring and impairment charges, gain on sale of equity investments and litigation 
settlement. 
Therefore, the Section 162(m) test was satisfied with respect to restricted stock units vesting based
on fiscal 2022 results.

Equity Compensation Plans Information regarding the equity compensation plans of the Company is set 
forth i n Item 11. Executive Compensation — “Executive Compensation — Compensation Tables — Equity 
Compensation Plans.” ITEM 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director 
Independence Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions The Board has adopted a written 
policy for review of transactions in any fiscal year in which the Company is a participant and in 
which any Director, Director nominee, executive officer, holder of more than 5% of our outstanding 
shares or any immediate family member of any of these persons has a direct or indirect material 
interest. Directors, Director nominees, 5% shareholders and executive officers are required to inform
the Company of any such transaction promptly after they become aware of it and the Company collects 
information from Directors, Director nominees and executive officers about their affiliations and 
affiliations of their family members so the Company can search its records for any such transactions.
Transactions are presented to the Governance and Nominating Committee of the Board (or to the Chair 
of the Committee if the Committee delegates this responsibility) for approval before they are entered
into or, if this is not possible, for ratification after the transaction has been entered into. The 
Committee approves or ratifies a transaction if it determines that the transaction is consistent with
the best interests of the Company, including whether the transaction impairs independence of a 
Director. Each of the investment management firms, Vanguard Group, Inc. and Blackrock, Inc., through 
their affiliates, held more than 5% of the Company’s shares during fiscal 2022. Funds managed by 
affiliates of Vanguard and Blackrock are included as investment options in defined contribution plans
offered to Company employees. In addition, Blackrock manages investment portfolios for the Company’s 
pension funds and provides a risk analytics platform related to management of investments in the 
pension funds. Vanguard and Blackrock received fees of approximately $1 million and $11 million, 
respectively, in fiscal 2022 based on the amounts invested in funds managed by them. The ongoing 
relationships were reviewed and approved in fiscal 2022 by the Governance and Nominating Committee 
under the Related Person Transaction Approval Policy. Beginning in fiscal 2021, MVL Productions LLC, 
a subsidiary of the Company, contracted with a company wholly owned by Mr. Chapek’s son, Brian Chapek
(“Mr. B. Chapek”), for Mr. B. Chapek’s exclusive services for a three-year period. The contract 
provides for Mr. B. Chapek to receive an annual base payment of $322,000 in fiscal 2021, $342,000 in 
fiscal 2022 and $367,000 in fiscal 2023. These amounts are inclusive of a payment in lieu of 
benefits. Additionally, Mr. B. Chapek will receive a $200,000 fee for each film on which he serves as
lead producer and an additional bonus calculated by a predetermined formula based on the worldwide 
box office of films on which he works, consistent with a range and structure typical of producer 
deals at Walt Disney Studios. For fiscal 2022, Mr. B. Chapek received his $342,000 base payment plus 
$40,000, 20% of his producer fee. In fiscal 2023, Mr. B. Chapek will receive an additional bonus of 
$31,000 pursuant to the terms of his contract. This relationship was reviewed and approved in fiscal 
2022 by the Governance and Nominating Committee under the Related Person Transaction Approval Policy.
59 
In fiscal 2022, Daniel McCormick, son of Christine McCarthy, Senior Executive Vice President and 
Chief Financial Officer, was employed as Senior Manager-Research in the General Entertainment Content
business. For fiscal 2022, Mr. McCormick’s base salary was $64,466 and his benefits were 
approximately $4,904, each prorated for the period of fiscal 2022 that he was employed by the Company
(April 4, 2022 to October 1, 2022), and his bonus was $24,300. On an annualized basis, his fiscal 
2022 base salary would have been $130,000, his benefits would have been approximately $10,626 and his
target bonus would be $19,500. Mr. McCormick was paid an amount and his compensation was structured 
the same as similarly situated employees. This relationship was reviewed and approved in fiscal 2022 
by the Governance and Nominating Committee under the Related Person Transaction Approval Policy. 
Director Independence 
The provisions of the Company’s Corporate Governance Guidelines regarding Director independence meet 
and, in some respects, exceed the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange. The Corporate 
Governance Guidelines are available on the Company’s Investor Relations website under the “Corporate 
Governance” heading at www.disney.com/investorsand in print to any shareholder who requests them from
the Company’s Secretary. 
Pursuant to the Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Board undertook its annual review of Director 
independence in November 2022. During this review, the Board considered transactions and 
relationships between the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates on the one hand, and on the 
other hand, Directors, immediate family members of Directors or entities of which a Director or an 
immediate family member is an executive officer, general partner or significant equity holder. The 
Board also considered whether there were any transactions or relationships between any of these 
persons or entities and the Company’s executive officers or their affiliates. As provided in the 
Corporate Governance Guidelines, the purpose of this review was to determine whether any such 
relationships or transactions existed that were inconsistent with a determination that the Director 
is independent. 
As a result of this review, the Board affirmatively determined that all of the Directors serving in 
fiscal 2022 or nominated for election at the 2023 Annual Meeting are independent of the Company and 
its management under the standards set forth in the Corporate Governance Guidelines, with the 
exception of Mr. Iger and Mr. Chapek, neither of which is considered independent because of 
employment as a senior executive of the Company. Additionally, Mr. Chapek’s son provided producer 
services to the Company in fiscal 2022, as discussed under the section titled “Certain Relationships 
and Related Person Transactions” above. 
In determining the independence of each Director, the Board considered and deemed immaterial to the 
Directors’ independence transactions involving the sale of products and services in the ordinary 
course of business between the Company on the one hand, and on the other, companies or organizations 
at which some of our Directors or their immediate family members were officers or employees during 
fiscal 2022. In each case, the amount paid to or received from these companies or organizations in 
each of the last three years was below the 2% of total revenue threshold in the Corporate Governance 
Guidelines. The Board determined that none of the relationships it considered impaired the 
independence of the Directors.

Policy for Approval of Audit and Permitted Non-AuditServices All audit, audit-related, tax and other 
services were pre-approvedby the Audit Committee, which concluded that the provision of such services
by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP was compatible with the maintenance of that firm’s independence in the 
conduct of its auditing functions. The Audit Committee’s Outside Auditor Independence and Pre- 
ApprovalPolicyprovides for pre-approvalof specifically described audit, audit-related, tax and other 
services by the Committee on an annual basis, but individual engagements anticipated to exceed pre- 
establishedthresholds must be separately approved. The policy also requires specific approval by the 
Committee if total fees for audit-related, tax and other services would exceed total fees for audit 
services in any fiscal year. The policy authorizes the Committee to delegate to one or more of its 
members pre-approvalauthority with respect to permitted services, and the Committee has delegated to 
the Chair of the Committee the authority to pre-approveservices in certain circumstances. 61
