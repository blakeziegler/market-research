 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
 General 
Walmart Inc. ("Walmart," the "Company" or "we") helps people around the world save money and live
better – anytime and anywhere – by providing the opportunity to shop in both retail stores and
through eCommerce, and to access our other service offerings. Through innovation, we strive to
continuously improve a customer-centric experience that seamlessly integrates our eCommerce and
retail stores in an omni-channel offering that saves time for our customers. Each week, we serve
approximately 230 million customers who visit more than 10,500 stores and numerous eCommerce websites
under 46 banners in 24 countries.
Our strategy is to make every day easier for busy families, operate with discipline, sharpen our
culture and become more digital, and make trust a competitive advantage. Making life easier for busy
families includes our commitment to price leadership, which has been and will remain a cornerstone of
our business, as well as increasing convenience to save our customers time. By leading on price, we
earn the trust of our customers every day by providing a broad assortment of quality merchandise and
services at everyday low prices ("EDLP"). EDLP is our pricing philosophy under which we price items
at a low price every day so our customers trust that our prices will not change under frequent
promotional activity. Everyday low cost ("EDLC") is our commitment to control expenses so our cost
savings can be passed along to our customers.
Our operations comprise three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's
Club. Our fiscal year ends on January 31 for our United States ("U.S.") and Canadian operations. We
consolidate all other operations generally using a one-month lag and on a calendar year basis. Our
discussion is as of and for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2022 ("fiscal 2022"), January 31, 2021
("fiscal 2021") and January 31, 2020 ("fiscal 2020"). During fiscal 2022, we generated total revenues
of $572.8 billion, which was comprised primarily of net sales of $567.8 billion.
We maintain our principal offices in Bentonville, Arkansas. Our common stock trades on the New York
Stock Exchange under the symbol "WMT."
 The Development of Our Company 
The businesses conducted by our founders began in 1945 when Sam M. Walton opened a franchise Ben
Franklin variety store in Newport, Arkansas. In 1946, his brother, James L. Walton, opened a similar
store in Versailles, Missouri. Until 1962, our founders' business was devoted entirely to the
operation of variety stores. In 1983, we opened our first Sam's Club, and in 1988, we opened our
first supercenter. In 1998, we opened our first Walmart Neighborhood Market. In 1991, we began our
first international initiative when we entered into a joint venture in Mexico and, as of January 31,
2022, our Walmart International segment conducted business in 23 countries.
In 2000, we began our first eCommerce initiative by creating both walmart.com and samsclub.com. Since
then, our eCommerce presence has continued to grow. In 2007, leveraging our physical stores,
walmart.com launched its Site to Store service, enabling customers to make a purchase online and pick
up merchandise in stores. To date, we now have over 8,000 pickup and 6,000 delivery locations
globally. In recent years, we have heavily invested in omni-channel and eCommerce innovation, as well
as made several eCommerce acquisitions to better serve our customers. These investments have enabled
us to leverage technology, talent and expertise, incubate digitally-native brands, and expand our
assortment and service offerings. We have also continued to enhance our eCommerce initiatives
internationally, such as with our acquisition of a majority stake of Flipkart Private Limited
("Flipkart"), which is our ecosystem in India that includes eCommerce platforms of Flipkart and
Myntra as well as PhonePe, a digital transaction platform.
We are enhancing our ecosystem with our omni-channel capabilities, stores, service offerings,
eCommerce websites and marketplaces as well as our supply chain combined with approximately 2.3
million associates as of January 31, 2022 to better serve our customers. Together, we believe these
elements produce a flywheel effect which creates relationships where customers view Walmart as their
primary destination. In the U.S., our Walmart+ membership incorporates several service offerings
which provide enhanced omni-channel shopping experiences and benefits for members. As we execute on
our strategy, our flywheel is accelerating through offerings such as our Walmart Connect advertising
business, Walmart Fulfillment Services, our health and wellness business, including Walmart Health,
and our financial services business. These offerings represent mutually reinforcing pieces of our
flywheel centered around our customers around the world who are increasingly seeking convenience.

 Information About Our Segments 
We are engaged in global operations of retail, wholesale and other units, as well as eCommerce,
located throughout the U.S., Africa, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India and Mexico. We also
previously operated in Argentina prior to the sale of Walmart Argentina in fiscal 2021 and operated
in the United Kingdom and Japan prior to the sale of those operations in the first quarter of fiscal
2022. Refer to Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information on these
divestitures. Our operations are conducted in three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart
International and Sam's Club, which are further described below. Each segment contributes to the
Company's operating results differently. However, each has generally maintained a consistent
contribution rate to the Company's net sales and operating income in recent years other than minor
changes to the contribution rate for the Walmart International segment due to fluctuations in
currency exchange rates. Additional information on our operating segments and geographic information
is contained in Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
 Walmart U.S. Segment 
Walmart U.S. is our largest segment and operates in the U.S., including in all 50 states, Washington
D.C. and Puerto Rico. Walmart U.S. is a mass merchandiser of consumer products, operating under the
"Walmart" and "Walmart Neighborhood Market" brands, as well as walmart.com and other eCommerce
brands. Walmart U.S. had net sales of $393.2 billion for fiscal 2022, representing 69% of our fiscal
2022 consolidated net sales, and had net sales of $370.0 billion and $341.0 billion for fiscal 2021
and 2020, respectively. Of our three segments, Walmart U.S. has historically had the highest gross
profit as a percentage of net sales ("gross profit rate"). In addition, Walmart U.S. has historically
contributed the greatest amount to the Company's net sales and operating income.
Omni-channel. Walmart U.S. provides an omni-channel experience to customers, integrating retail
stores and eCommerce, through services such as pickup and delivery, ship-from-store, and digital
pharmacy fulfillment options. As of January 31, 2022, we had approximately 4,600 pickup locations and
more than 3,500 same-day delivery locations. Our Walmart+ membership offering provides enhanced omni-
channel shopping benefits that currently include unlimited free shipping on eligible items with no
order minimum, unlimited delivery from store, fuel and pharmacy discounts, and mobile scan & go for a
streamlined in-store shopping experience. We have several eCommerce websites, the largest of which is
walmart.com. We define eCommerce sales as sales initiated by customers digitally and fulfilled by a
number of methods including our dedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers and leveraging our stores.
The following table provides the approximate size of our retail stores as of January 31, 2022:

Merchandise. Walmart U.S. does business in three strategic merchandise units, listed below:
• Grocery consists of a full line of grocery items, including dry grocery, snacks, dairy, meat,
produce, deli & bakery, frozen foods, alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages, as well as consumables
such as health and beauty aids, pet supplies, household chemicals, paper goods and baby products;
• General merchandise includes:
◦ Entertainment (e.g., electronics, toys, seasonal merchandise, wireless, video games, movies, music
and books);
◦ Hardlines (e.g., automotive, hardware and paint, sporting goods, outdoor living and stationery);
◦ Apparel (e.g., apparel for men, women, girls, boys and infants, as well as shoes, jewelry and
accessories); and
◦ Home (e.g., housewares and small appliances, bed & bath, furniture and home organization, home
furnishings, home decor, fabrics and crafts).
• Health and wellness includes pharmacy, over-the-counter drugs and other medical products, optical
services and other clinical services.
Brand name merchandise represents a significant portion of the merchandise sold in Walmart U.S. We
also market lines of merchandise under our private brands, including brands such as: "Allswell,"
"Athletic Works," "Bonobos Fielder," "Eloquii Elements," "Equate," "Free Assembly," "Freshness
Guaranteed," "George," "Great Value," "Holiday Time," "Hyper Tough," "Mainstays," "Marketside," "No
Boundaries," "onn.," "Ozark Trail," "Parent's Choice," "Sam's Choice," "Scoop," "Spring Valley,"
"Time and Tru," "Way to Celebrate" and "Wonder Nation." The Company also markets lines of merchandise
under licensed brands, some of which include: "Avia," "Better Homes & Gardens," "Pioneer Woman" and
"Sofia Jeans by Sofia Vergara."
 7 
Periodically, revisions are made to the categorization of the components comprising our strategic
merchandise units. When revisions are made, the previous periods' presentation is adjusted to
maintain comparability.
The Walmart U.S. business also includes an in-house advertising offering via Walmart Connect, supply
chain and fulfillment capabilities to online marketplace sellers via Walmart Fulfillment Services,
and access to quality, affordable healthcare via Walmart Health. In Fiscal 2022, Walmart U.S.
initiatives also included the launch of a B2B last mile delivery service platform via Walmart
GoLocal, and Walmart Luminate which provides a suite of data products to merchants and suppliers.
Additional service offerings include fuel, financial services and related products (including through
our digital channels, stores and clubs as well as our previously announced fintech joint venture),
such as money orders, prepaid access, money transfers, check cashing, bill payment, and certain types
of installment lending. Combined, these offerings do not currently represent a significant portion of
annual segment revenues.
Operations. Walmart U.S. is available to customers through supercenters, discount stores and
neighborhood markets, as well as online or through the mobile application 24 hours a day. Consistent
with its strategy, Walmart U.S. continues to develop technology tools and services to better serve
customers and help stores operate more efficiently, such as pickup and delivery, Walmart+, ship-from-
store and other initiatives which provide convenient and seamless omni-channel shopping experiences.
Seasonal Aspects of Operations. Walmart U.S.'s business is seasonal to a certain extent due to
calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as different weather patterns.
Historically, its highest sales volume has occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31.
Competition. Walmart U.S. competes with brick and mortar, eCommerce, and omni-channel retailers
operating discount, department, retail and wholesale grocers, drug, dollar, variety and specialty
stores, supermarkets, hypermarkets and supercenter-type stores, eCommerce retailers, as well as
companies that offer services in digital advertising, fulfillment and delivery services, health and
wellness, and financial services. Each of these landscapes is highly competitive and rapidly
evolving, and new business models and the entry of new, well-funded competitors continue to intensify
this competition. Some of our competitors have longer histories in these lines of business, more
customers, and greater brand recognition. They may be able to obtain more favorable terms from
suppliers and business partners and to devote greater resources to the development of these
businesses. In addition, for eCommerce and other internet-based businesses, newer or smaller
businesses may be better able to innovate and compete with us.
Our ability to develop and operate units at the right locations and to deliver a customer-centric
omni-channel experience largely determines our competitive position within the retail industry. We
compete in a variety of ways, including the prices at which we sell our merchandise, merchandise
selection availability, services offered to customers, location, store hours, in-store amenities, the
shopping convenience and overall shopping experience we offer, the attractiveness and ease of use of
our digital platforms, cost and speed of and options for delivery to customers of merchandise
purchased through our digital platforms or through our omni-channel integration of our physical and
digital operations. We employ many strategies and programs designed to meet competitive pressures
within our industry. These strategies include the following:
• EDLP: our pricing philosophy under which we price items at everyday low prices so our customers
trust that our prices will not change under frequent promotional activity;
• EDLC: everyday low cost is our commitment to control expenses so our cost savings can be passed
along to our customers;
• Omni-channel offerings such as pickup and delivery and our Walmart+ membership offering, all of
which enhance convenience and seek to serve customers in the ways they want to be served; and
• Expanding our flywheel and the products and services we offer in areas such as digital advertising,
fulfillment services, health and wellness, and financial services.
Distribution. We utilize a total of 157 distribution facilities which are located strategically
throughout the U.S. For fiscal 2022, the majority of Walmart U.S.'s purchases of store merchandise
were shipped through these facilities, while most of the remaining store merchandise we purchased was
shipped directly from suppliers. General merchandise and dry grocery merchandise is transported
primarily through the segment's private truck fleet; however, we contract with common carriers to
transport the majority of our perishable grocery merchandise. We ship merchandise purchased by
customers on our eCommerce platforms by a number of methods from multiple locations including from
our 31 dedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers, as well as leveraging our ability to ship or deliver
directly from more than 3,500 stores.
 Walmart International Segment 
Walmart International is our second largest segment and operated in 23 countries outside of the U.S.
as of January 31, 2022. Walmart International operates through our wholly-owned subsidiaries in
Canada, Chile, and China, and our majority-owned subsidiaries in Africa (which includes Botswana,
Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania,
Uganda and Zambia), India, as well as Mexico and Central America (which includes Costa Rica, El
Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua). Walmart International previously operated in Argentina
prior to the sale of
 8 
Walmart Argentina in fiscal 2021 and operated in the United Kingdom and Japan prior to the sale of
those operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Refer to Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial
Statements for discussion of recent divestitures.
Walmart International includes numerous formats divided into two major categories: retail and
wholesale. These categories consist of many formats, including: supercenters, supermarkets,
hypermarkets, warehouse clubs (including Sam's Clubs) and cash & carry, as well as eCommerce through
walmart.com.mx, walmart.ca, flipkart.com and other sites. Walmart International had net sales of
$101.0 billion for fiscal 2022, representing 18% of our fiscal 2022 consolidated net sales, and had
net sales of $121.4 billion and $120.1 billion for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. The gross
profit rate is lower than that of Walmart U.S. primarily because of its format mix.
Walmart International's strategy is to create strong local businesses powered by Walmart which means
being locally relevant and customer-focused in each of the markets it operates. We are being
deliberate about where and how we choose to operate and continue to re-shape the portfolio to best
enable long-term, sustainable and profitable growth. As such, we have taken certain strategic actions
to strengthen our Walmart International portfolio for the long-term, which include the following
highlights over the last three years:
• Divestiture of Walmart Argentina in November 2020.
• Divestiture of Asda Group Limited ("Asda"), our retail operations in the U.K., in February 2021.
• Divestiture of a majority stake in Seiyu, our retail operations in Japan, in March 2021.
Omni-channel. Walmart International provides an omni-channel experience to customers, integrating
retail stores and eCommerce, such as through pickup and delivery services in most of our markets, our
marketplaces such as Flipkart in India, and a digital transaction platform anchored in payments such
as PhonePe in India. Same-day delivery capacity continues to expand in Mexico, including our recent
launch of a membership model which provides unlimited same-day delivery from stores, and in China,
our partnerships with JD.com and JD Daojia provide customers one-hour delivery by leveraging Walmart
stores as fulfillment centers. A value-based internet and telephone service was recently launched in
Mexico allowing customers to enjoy digital connectivity.
Generally, retail units' selling areas range in size from 1,400 square feet to 186,000 square feet.
Our wholesale stores' selling areas generally range in size from 24,000 square feet to 158,000 square
feet. As of January 31, 2022, Walmart International had approximately 2,900 pickup and over 1,900
delivery locations.
Merchandise. The merchandising strategy for Walmart International is similar to that of our
operations in the U.S. in terms of the breadth and scope of merchandise offered for sale. While brand
name merchandise accounts for a majority of our sales, we have both leveraged U.S. private brands and
developed market specific private brands to serve our customers with high quality, low priced items.
Along with the private brands we market globally, such as "Equate," "George," "Great Value," "Holiday
Time," "Mainstays," "Marketside" and "Parent's Choice," our international markets have developed
market specific brands including "Aurrera," "Cambridge," "Extra Special," "Lider," "Myntra," and
"PhonePe." In addition, we have developed and continue to grow our relationships with regional and
local suppliers in each market to ensure reliable sources of quality merchandise that is equal to
national brands at low prices.
Walmart International also offers advertising, financial services and related products in various
markets. Our businesses in Mexico and Canada, for example, offer prepaid cards and money transfers,
and our PhonePe business in India provides a platform that offers mobile and bill payment, person-to-
person (P2P) payment, investment and insurance solutions, financial services and advertising.
Combined, these offerings did not represent a significant portion of annual segment revenues.
Operations. The hours of operation for operating units in Walmart International vary by country and
by individual markets within countries, depending upon local and national ordinances governing hours
of operation. Consistent with its strategy, Walmart International continues to develop technology
tools and services to better serve customers and help its various formats operate more efficiently,
as well as to provide convenient and seamless omni-channel shopping experiences.
Seasonal Aspects of Operations. Walmart International's business is seasonal to a certain extent.
Historically, its highest sales volume has occurred in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. The
seasonality of the business varies by country due to different national and religious holidays,
festivals and customs, as well as different weather patterns.
Competition. Walmart International competes with brick and mortar, eCommerce, and omni-channel
retailers who operate department, drug, discount, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets,
hypermarkets and supercenter-type stores, wholesale clubs, home-improvement stores, specialty
electronics stores, cash & carry operations and convenience stores, and eCommerce retailers, as well
as catalog businesses. Our ability to develop and operate units at the right locations and to deliver
a customer-centric omni-channel experience largely determines our competitive position within the
retail industry. We believe price leadership is a critical part of our business model and we continue
to focus on moving our markets towards an EDLP approach. Additionally, our ability to operate food
departments effectively has a significant impact on our competitive position in the markets where we
operate. Each of these landscapes is highly competitive and rapidly evolving, and new business models
and the entry of new, well-funded competitors continue to intensify this competition. Some of our
competitors have longer histories
 9 
in these lines of business, more customers, and greater brand recognition. They may be able to obtain
more favorable terms from suppliers and business partners and to devote greater resources to the
development of these businesses. In addition, for eCommerce and other internet-based businesses,
newer or smaller businesses may be better able to innovate and compete with us.
Distribution. We utilize a total of 179 distribution facilities located in Canada, Central America,
Chile, China, India, Mexico and South Africa. Through these facilities, we process and distribute
both imported and domestic products to the operating units of the Walmart International segment.
During fiscal 2022, the majority of Walmart International's purchases passed through these
distribution facilities. Suppliers ship the remainder of Walmart International's purchases directly
to our stores in the various markets in which we operate. Across the segment, we have efficient
networks connecting physical stores and distribution and fulfillment centers which facilitate the
movement of goods to where our customers live. We ship merchandise purchased by customers on our
eCommerce platforms by a number of methods from multiple locations including from our 83 dedicated
eCommerce fulfillment centers, more than 3,400 eCommerce sort centers and last-mile delivery
facilities in India, as well as our physical retail stores.
 Sam's Club Segment 
Sam's Club operates in 44 states in the U.S. and in Puerto Rico. Sam's Club is a membership-only
warehouse club that also operates samsclub.com. Sam's Club had net sales of $73.6 billion for fiscal
2022, representing 13% of our consolidated fiscal 2022 net sales, and had net sales of $63.9 billion
and $58.8 billion for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. As a membership-only warehouse club,
membership income is a significant component of the segment's operating income. Sam's Club operates
with a lower gross profit rate and lower operating expenses as a percentage of net sales than our
other segments.
Membership. The following two options are available to members:
 Plus Membership Club Membership 
 Annual Membership Fee $100 $45 
 Number of Add-on Memberships ($40 each) Up to 16 Up to 8 
All memberships include a spouse/household card at no additional cost. Plus Members are also eligible
for free shipping on the majority of merchandise, with no minimum order size, and receive discounts

Back for Sam's Club Mastercard holders. Members may redeem Sam's Cash on purchases in the club and
online, to pay for membership fees or for cash in clubs. Sam's Cash does not expire and is available
for monthly redemption.
Omni-channel. Sam's Club provides an omni-channel experience to customers, integrating retail stores
and eCommerce through such services as Curbside Pickup, mobile Scan & Go, ship-from-club, and

The warehouse facility sizes generally range between 32,000 and 168,000 square feet, with an average
size of approximately 134,000 square feet.
Merchandise. Sam's Club offers merchandise in the following five merchandise categories:
• Grocery and consumables includes dairy, meat, bakery, deli, produce, dry, chilled or frozen

technology tools to drive a great member experience. Curbside Pickup is available at all clubs to
help provide fast, easy and contact-free shopping for members. Sam's Club also offers "Scan & Go," a
mobile checkout and payment solution, which allows members to bypass the checkout line.
 10 
Seasonal Aspects of Operations. Sam's Club's business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar
events and national and religious holidays, as well as different weather patterns. Historically, its
highest sales volume has occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31.
Competition. Sam's Club competes with other membership-only warehouse clubs, the largest of which is
Costco, as well as with discount retailers, retail and wholesale grocers, general merchandise
wholesalers and distributors, gasoline stations as well as omni-channel and eCommerce retailers and
catalog businesses. At Sam's Club, we provide value at members-only prices, a quality merchandise
assortment, and bulk sizing to serve both our Plus and Club members. Our eCommerce website and mobile
commerce applications have increasingly become important factors in our ability to compete.
Distribution. We utilize 28 dedicated distribution facilities located strategically throughout the
U.S., as well as some of the Walmart U.S. segment's distribution facilities which service the Sam's
Club segment for certain items. During fiscal 2022, the majority of Sam's Club's non-fuel club
purchases were shipped from these facilities, while the remainder of our purchases were shipped
directly to Sam's Club locations by suppliers. Sam's Club ships merchandise purchased on samsclub.com
and through its mobile commerce applications by a number of methods including shipments made directly
from clubs, 12 dedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers and other distribution centers.
Sam's Club uses a combination of our private truck fleet, as well as common carriers, to transport
non-perishable merchandise from distribution facilities to clubs. The segment contracts with common
carriers to transport perishable grocery merchandise from distribution facilities to clubs.
 Intellectual Property 
We regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade
secrets, proprietary technologies, and similar intellectual property as important to our success, and
with respect to our associates, customers and others, we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent
law, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements to protect our

international domain names, trademarks, service marks and copyrights. Additionally, we have filed
U.S. and international patent applications covering certain of our proprietary technology. We have
licensed in the past, and expect that we may license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights
to third parties.
 Suppliers and Supply Chain 
As a retailer and warehouse club operator, we utilize a global supply chain that includes both U.S.
and international suppliers from whom we purchase the merchandise that we sell in our stores, clubs
and online. In many instances, we purchase merchandise from producers located near the stores and
clubs in which such merchandise will be sold, particularly products in the "fresh" category. We offer
our suppliers the opportunity to efficiently sell significant quantities of their products to us.
These relationships enable us to obtain pricing that reflects the volume, certainty and cost-
effectiveness these arrangements provide to such suppliers, which in turn enables us to provide low
prices to our customers. Our suppliers are subject to standards of conduct, including requirements
that they comply with local labor laws, local worker safety laws and other applicable laws. Our
ability to acquire from our suppliers the assortment and volume of products we wish to offer to our
customers, to receive those products within the required time through our supply chain and to
distribute those products to our stores and clubs, determines, along with other supply chain
logistics matters (such as containers or port access for example), in part, our in-stock levels in
our stores and clubs and the attractiveness of our merchandise assortment we offer to our customers
and members.
 Government Regulation 
As a company with global operations, we are subject to the laws of the United States and multiple
foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies,
which may differ among jurisdictions. For additional information, see the risk factors herein in "
Item 1A. Risk Factors " under the sub-caption "Legal, Tax, Regulatory, Compliance, Reputational and
Other Risks."
Environmental, Social and Governance ("ESG") Priorities
Our ESG strategy is centered on the concept of creating shared value: we believe we maximize long-
term value and create competitive advantage for the Company by serving our stakeholders, including
our customers, associates, shareholders, suppliers, business partners, and communities. We believe
that addressing such societal needs builds the value of our business, including by enhancing customer
and associate trust, creating new revenue streams, managing cost and risk, building capabilities for
future advantage, and strengthening the underlying systems we all rely on.
We prioritize the ESG issues that offer the greatest potential for Walmart to create shared value:
issues that rank high in relevance to our business and stakeholders and which Walmart is positioned
to make a positive impact. Our current ESG priorities are categorized into four broad themes:
opportunity, sustainability, community, and ethics and integrity.
 11 
• Opportunity . Retail can be a powerful engine for inclusive economic opportunity. We aim to advance
diversity, equity, and inclusion, and to provide opportunity for Walmart associates (as further
described in the Human Capital Management section below), our supply chain and the communities we're
in to fulfill our customer mission, strengthen our business and help people build a better life for
themselves and their families.
• Sustainability . Walmart's sustainability efforts focus on our ability to create and preserve long-
term value for both people and planet. With respect to people, our sustainability efforts focus on
sourcing responsibly, helping prevent forced labor, empowering women, creating inclusive economic
opportunity and selling safer, healthier products. With respect to the planet, our efforts aim to
enhance the sustainability of product supply chains by reducing emissions, protecting and restoring
nature, and reducing waste. To help address the effects of climate change, Walmart has set science-
based targets for emissions reduction, including our goal to achieve zero emissions in our operations
by 2040—without offsets—and to reduce or avoid one billion metric tons of emissions in our value
chain by 2030 under our Project Gigaton™ initiative.
• Community . Walmart aims to serve and strengthen communities by operating our business in a way
that meets the needs of our customer and community stakeholder groups, including by providing safer,
healthier and more affordable food and other products, disaster support, associate volunteerism,
local grant programs and community cohesion initiatives.
• Ethics and Integrity . At every level of our Company, we work to create a culture that inspires
trust among our associates, with our customers, and in the communities we serve .
We periodically publish information on our ESG priorities, strategies, and progress on our corporate
website and may update those disclosures from time to time. Nothing on our website, including our ESG
reporting, documents or sections thereof, shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this Annual
Report on Form 10-K.
 Human Capital Management 
Our commitment to help people around the world save money and live better is delivered by our
associates who make the difference for our customers every day. As of the end of fiscal 2022, we
employed approximately 2.3 million associates worldwide, with approximately 1.7 million associates in
the U.S. and approximately 0.6 million associates internationally. In the U.S., approximately 94% of
these associates are hourly and approximately 69% are full-time.
We believe the strength of our workforce, our associates, is a significant contributor to our
success. Walmart is a place of opportunity, not only as a foundational entry point to develop
critical skills that are relevant for a variety of careers, but also a place where people can grow in
their careers across our global omni-channel business. As customer expectations and technology change
the nature of work, we are focused on attracting, developing, rewarding, and retaining associates to
thrive in an ever-changing environment. Approximately 75% of our U.S. salaried store, club and supply
chain management started their careers in hourly positions. Our focus on providing a path of career
opportunity for our associates through robust training, competitive wages and benefits, and
opportunities for advancement creates a strong associate value proposition. The COVID-19 pandemic and
the related reassessment taking place across the workforce had an impact on our retention of
associates and as a result turnover in the U.S. increased compared to the previous fiscal year.
Our workforce strategy includes the following strategic priorities:
Inclusion - Build a Walmart for everyone: a diverse, equitable and inclusive company, where
associates' ideas and opinions matter . We are focused on creating an inclusive culture and a diverse
associate base. Creating an environment where all associates believe they belong and are empowered to
be themselves, which we believe is essential in serving our customers now and in the future. We
publish our diversity representation twice yearly, and hold ourselves accountable to providing
recurring culture, diversity, equity, and inclusion updates to senior leadership, including our
President and CEO, and members of the Board of Directors. Of the approximately 2.3 million associates
employed worldwide, 53% identify as women. In the U.S., 49% of the approximately 1.7 million
associates identify as people of color.
We review our processes regarding our commitment to fair-pay practices. We are committed to creating
a performance culture where associates are rewarded based on meaningful factors such as
qualifications, experience, performance, and the work they do.
To build a company where associates feel engaged, valued and heard, we gather and respond to
associates' feedback in a variety of ways, including but not limited to an anonymous, periodic
associate engagement survey, our Open Door process, and one-on-one interactions. Management reviews
the results of feedback obtained from our formal associate engagement survey. Feedback and
suggestions received through these channels have led to meaningful changes in our business.
Well-being - Focus on the physical, emotional, and financial well-being of our associates. We invest
in our associates by offering competitive wages, as well as a broad range of benefits that vary based
on customary local practices and statutory requirements, and we believe these investments in our
associates are important to our future. In the U.S., we offer affordable healthcare coverage to our
full-time and eligible part-time associates as well as company paid benefits such as 401(k) match,
 12 
maternity leave, a paid parental leave program to all full-time associates, paid time off, Associate
Stock Purchase Plan match, life insurance, behavioral health services, and a store discount card or
Sam's Club membership. Additional information about how we invest in our associates' well-being,
including wage structure and pay, can be found in our Human Capital brief in our most recent ESG
reporting, which is available on our corporate website. Nothing on our website, including our ESG
reporting documents, or sections thereof, shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this Annual
Report on Form 10-K or incorporated by reference into any of our other filings with the Securities
and Exchange Commission. Certain information relating to retirement-related benefits we provide to
our associates is included in Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
The health and safety of our associates remain our biggest priorities and we continue to focus on
enabling access to vaccines, providing safeguards within facilities, and supporting associates. We
encourage all associates to consider the COVID-19 vaccine and provide access to make the decision
easier. Associates can become vaccinated while on the clock or receive paid time off to do so. Our
COVID-leave policy, which was implemented in March 2020 to support associates during the pandemic,
has been extended through March 31, 2022.
Growth - Provide ongoing growth, development and learning opportunities for associates and continue
to attract talent with new skills. We are invested in the growth of our associates in support of our
business and their success. We invest in associate development – including new roles and career
paths, cross-training, on-the-job learning and coaching, and formal, classroom-style training such as
Walmart Academy in the U.S. We also provide access to educational opportunities for our eligible
associates through our Live Better U program, which provides a pathway to earn a high school diploma
or a college degree at no cost, as well as multiple digital learning opportunities.
Digital - Accelerate digital transformation and ways of working to improve the associate experience
and drive business results . To deliver a seamless customer and associate experience, we continue to
invest in digital tools to improve associate productivity, engagement, and performance. As more
customers shop digitally, we have adapted by adding more roles in eCommerce fulfillment and our home
office associates have accelerated tech-based solutions that enhance the customer and associate
experiences.

 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
The risks described below could, in ways we may or may not be able to accurately predict, materially
and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial position and liquidity. Our
business operations could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies
operating in the U.S. and globally. The following risk factors do not identify all risks that we may
face.
 Strategic Risks 
Failure to successfully execute our omni-channel strategy and the cost of our investments in
eCommerce and technology may materially adversely affect our market position, net sales and financial
performance.
The retail business continues to rapidly evolve and consumers increasingly embrace digital shopping.
As a result, the portion of total consumer expenditures with retailers and wholesale clubs occurring
through digital platforms is increasing and the pace of this increase could continue to accelerate.
Our strategy, which includes investments in eCommerce, technology, talent, supply chain automation,
acquisitions, joint ventures, store remodels and other customer initiatives, may not adequately or
effectively allow us to continue to grow our eCommerce business, increase comparable sales, maintain
or grow our overall market position or otherwise offset the impact on the growth of our business of a
moderated pace of new store and club openings. The success of this strategy will depend in large
measure on our ability to continue building and delivering a seamless omni-channel shopping
experience and interconnected ecosystem for our customers that deepens our relationships with our
customers across our various businesses and partnerships and reinforces our overall flywheel
strategy. The success of this strategy is further subject to the related risks discussed in this Item
1A . With the interconnected components of this flywheel strategy and an increasing allocation of
capital expenditures focused on these initiatives, our failure to successfully execute on individual
components of this strategy may adversely affect our market position, net sales and financial
performance which could also result in impairment charges to intangible assets or other long-lived
assets. In addition, a greater concentration of eCommerce sales, including increasing online grocery
sales, could result in a reduction in the amount of traffic in our stores and clubs, which would, in
turn, reduce the opportunities for cross-store or cross-club sales of merchandise that such traffic
creates and could reduce our sales within our stores and clubs and materially adversely affect our
financial performance.
Furthermore, the cost of certain investments in eCommerce, technology, talent, automation, including
any operating losses incurred, will adversely impact our financial performance in the short-term and
failure to realize the benefits of these investments may adversely impact our financial performance
over the longer term.
If we do not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends or preferences, it could
negatively affect our relationship with our customers, demand for the products and services we sell,
our market share and the growth of our business.
It is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will
demand and changes in their shopping patterns. The success of our business depends in part on how
accurately we predict consumer demand, availability of merchandise, the related impact on the demand
for existing products and services and the competitive environment. Price transparency, assortment of
products, customer experience, convenience, ease and the speed and cost of shipping are of primary
importance to customers and continue to increase in importance, particularly as a result of digital
tools and social media available to consumers and the choices available to consumers for purchasing
products. Our failure to adequately or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences
(including those related to ESG issues) and shopping patterns, or any other failure on our part to
timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences and shopping patterns
 15 
could negatively affect our reputation and relationship with our customers, the demand for the
products we sell or services we offer, our market share and the growth of our business.
We face strong competition from other retailers, wholesale club operators, omni-channel retailers,
and other businesses which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.
Each of our segments competes for customers, employees, digital prominence, products and services and
in other important aspects of its business with many other local, regional, national and global
physical, eCommerce and omni-channel retailers, wholesale club operators and retail intermediaries,
as well as companies that offer services in digital advertising, fulfillment and delivery services,
health and wellness, and financial services. The omni-channel retail landscape is highly competitive
and rapidly evolving, and the entry of new, well-funded competitors may increase competitive
pressures. In addition, for eCommerce and other internet-based businesses, newer or smaller
businesses may be better able to innovate and compete with us.
We compete in a variety of ways, including the prices at which we sell our merchandise, merchandise
selection and availability, services offered to customers, location, store hours, in-store amenities,
the shopping convenience and overall shopping experience we offer, the attractiveness and ease of use
of our digital platforms, cost and speed of and options for delivery to customers of merchandise
purchased through our digital platforms or through our omni-channel integration of our physical and
digital operations.
A failure to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail and other markets
in which we operate, omni-channel innovations and omni-channel ecosystems developed by our
competitors or delays or failure in execution of our strategy could materially adversely affect our
financial performance. See " Item 1. Business " above for additional discussion of the competitive
situation of each of our reportable segments.
Certain segments of the retail industry are undergoing consolidation or substantially reducing
operations, whether due to bankruptcy, consolidation or other factors. Such consolidation, or other
business combinations or alliances, competitive omni-channel ecosystems, or reductions in operations
may result in competitors with greatly improved financial resources, improved access to merchandise,
greater market penetration and other improvements in their competitive positions. Such business
combinations or alliances could allow these companies to provide a wider variety of products and
services at competitive prices, which could adversely affect our financial performance.
General or macro-economic factors, both domestically and internationally, may materially adversely
affect our financial performance.
General economic conditions and other economic factors, globally or in one or more of the markets we
serve, may adversely affect our financial performance. Higher interest rates, lower or higher prices
of petroleum products, including crude oil, natural gas, gasoline, and diesel fuel, higher costs for
electricity and other energy, weakness in the housing market, inflation, deflation, increased costs
of essential services, such as medical care and utilities, higher levels of unemployment, decreases
in consumer disposable income, unavailability of consumer credit, higher consumer debt levels,
changes in consumer spending and shopping patterns, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, higher
tax rates, imposition of new taxes or other changes in tax laws, changes in healthcare laws, other
regulatory changes, the imposition of tariffs or other measures that create barriers to or increase
the costs associated with international trade, overall economic slowdown or recession and other
economic factors in the U.S. or in any of the other markets in which we operate could adversely
affect consumer demand for the products and services we sell in the U.S. or such other markets,
change the mix of products we sell to one with a lower average gross margin, cause a slowdown in
discretionary purchases of goods, adversely affect our net sales and result in slower inventory
turnover and greater markdowns of inventory, or otherwise materially adversely affect our operations
and operating results and could result in impairment charges to intangible assets, goodwill or other
long-lived assets.
In addition, the economic factors listed above, any other economic factors or circumstances resulting
in higher transportation, labor, insurance or healthcare costs or commodity prices, and other
economic factors in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate can increase our cost of sales
and operating, selling, general and administrative expenses and otherwise materially adversely affect
our operations and operating results.
The economic factors that affect our operations may also adversely affect the operations of our
suppliers, which can result in an increase in the cost to us of the goods we sell to our customers
or, in more extreme cases, in certain suppliers not producing goods in the volume typically available
to us for sale.
The performance of strategic alliances and other business relationships to support the expansion of
our business could materially adversely affect our financial performance.
We may enter into strategic alliances and other business relationships in the countries in which we
have existing operations or in other markets to expand our business. These arrangements may not
generate the level of sales we anticipate when entering into the arrangement or may otherwise
adversely impact our business and competitive position relative to the results we could
 16 
have achieved in the absence of such alliance. In addition, any investment we make in connection with
a strategic alliance, business relationship or in certain of our recently divested markets, could
materially adversely affect our financial performance.
 Operational Risks 
The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial position and results of operations
continues to be unpredictable, and we may be unable to sustain our revenue growth rate in the future.
The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic continue to be highly unpredictable and volatile in light of the
potential for a resurgence of infection rates or as a result of future mutations, variants, or
related strains of the virus. Recent years have demonstrated the widespread and varying impacts of
the pandemic on certain business operations, demand for our products and services, in-stock
positions, costs of doing business, access to inventory, supply chain operations, the extent and
duration of measures to try to contain the virus (such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines,
shelter-in-place orders, business and government shutdowns, and other restrictions on retailers), our
ability to predict future performance, exposure to litigation, and our financial performance, among
other things.
Customer behaviors have changed rapidly during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the event of a
resurgence of infections or future mutations, variants or related strains of the virus become
prevalent, customer demand for certain products may fluctuate and customer behaviors may change,
which may challenge our ability to anticipate and/or adjust inventory levels to meet that demand.
These factors may result in higher out-of-stock positions in certain products, as well as delays in
delivering those products, and could impact inventory levels in the future.
Other factors and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: the severity and duration of the
pandemic, including whether there are additional outbreaks or spikes in the number of COVID-19 cases,
future mutations or related strains of the virus in areas in which we and our suppliers operate;
further increased operational costs associated with operating during a global pandemic; evolving
macroeconomic factors, including general economic uncertainty, unemployment rates, and recessionary
pressures; unknown consequences on our business performance and initiatives stemming from the
substantial investment of time, capital and other resources to the pandemic response; the
effectiveness and extent of administration of vaccinations and medical treatments for COVID-19 or
other variants; the pace of recovery when the pandemic subsides; and the long-term impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic on our business, including consumer behaviors. These risks and their impacts are
difficult to predict and could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations and our
financial performance.
The COVID-19 pandemic has led to increased revenue growth relative to historic trends, and has
particularly accelerated our eCommerce growth. These results, as well as those of other metrics such
as net income and other financial and operating data, may not be indicative of results for future
periods. Once the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, particularly as vaccines become more
widely available, and customers return to work or school or are otherwise no longer subject to the
aforementioned containment directives and similar mandates, a failure by us to continue capitalizing
on growth opportunities may result in declining revenue and future operating results may fall below
expectations.
To the extent that the COVID-19 pandemic continues to adversely affect the U.S. and the global
economy, it may also heighten other risks described in this section, including but not limited to
those related to consumer behavior and expectations, competition, our reputation, implementation of
strategic initiatives, cybersecurity threats, payment-related risks, technology systems disruption,
supply chain disruptions, labor availability and cost, litigation, and regulatory requirements.
Natural disasters, climate change, geopolitical events, global health epidemics or pandemics and
catastrophic events could materially adversely affect our financial performance.
The occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tropical storms, floods, fires,
earthquakes, tsunamis, cyclones, typhoons; weather conditions such as major or extended winter
storms, droughts and tornadoes, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise; geopolitical
events; global health epidemics or pandemics or other contagious outbreaks such as the ongoing
COVID-19 pandemic; and catastrophic events, such as war, civil unrest, terrorist attacks or other
acts of violence, including active shooter situations (such as those that have occurred in our U.S.
stores), in countries in which we operate, in which our suppliers are located, or in other areas of
the world (such as in Ukraine where armed hostilities currently exist between Ukraine and Russia)
could adversely affect our operations and financial performance.
Such events could result in physical damage to, or the complete loss of, one or more of our
properties, the closure of one or more stores, clubs and distribution or fulfillment centers,
limitations on store or club operating hours, the lack of an adequate work force in a market, the
inability of customers and associates to reach or have transportation to our stores and clubs
affected by such events, the evacuation of the populace from areas in which our stores, clubs and
distribution and fulfillment centers are located, the unavailability of our digital platforms to our
customers, changes in the purchasing patterns of consumers (including the frequency of visits by
consumers to physical retail locations, whether as a result of limitations on large gatherings,
travel and movement limitations or otherwise) and in consumers' disposable income, the temporary or
long-term disruption in the supply of products from some suppliers, the disruption in the transport
of goods from overseas, the disruption or delay in the delivery of goods to our distribution and
fulfillment centers or stores within a country in which we are operating, the reduction in the
availability of products in our stores, increases in the costs of procuring products as a result of
either reduced availability
 17 
or economic sanctions, increased transportation costs (whether due to fuel prices, fuel supply, or
otherwise), the disruption (whether directly or indirectly) of critical infrastructure systems,
banking systems, utility services or energy availability to our stores, clubs and our facilities, and
the disruption in our communications with our stores, clubs and our other facilities.
Furthermore, the long-term impacts of climate change, whether involving physical risks (such as
extreme weather conditions, drought, or rising sea levels) or transition risks (such as regulatory or
technology changes) are expected to be widespread and unpredictable. Certain impacts of physical risk
may include: temperature changes that increase the heating and cooling costs at stores, clubs, and
distribution or fulfillment centers; extreme weather patterns that affect the production or sourcing
of certain commodities; flooding and extreme storms that damage or destroy our buildings and
inventory; and heat and extreme weather events that cause long-term disruption or threats to the
habitability of the communities in which Walmart operates. Relative to transition risk, certain
impacts may include: changes in energy and commodity prices driven by climate-related weather events;
prolonged climate-related events affecting macroeconomic conditions with related effects on consumer
spending and confidence; stakeholder perception of our engagement in climate-related policies; and
new regulatory requirements resulting in higher compliance risk and operational costs.
We bear the risk of losses incurred as a result of physical damage to, or destruction of, any stores,
clubs and distribution or fulfillment centers, loss or spoilage of inventory and business
interruption caused by such events. These events and their impacts could otherwise disrupt and
adversely affect our operations and could materially adversely affect our financial performance.
Risks associated with our suppliers could materially adversely affect our financial performance.
The products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers. Global
sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance. We
expect our suppliers to comply with applicable laws, including labor, safety, anti-corruption and
environmental laws, and to otherwise meet our required supplier standards of conduct. Our ability to
find qualified suppliers who uphold our standards, and to access products in a timely and efficient
manner and in the large volumes we may demand, is a significant challenge, especially with respect to
suppliers located and goods sourced outside the U.S.
Political and economic instability, as well as other impactful events and circumstances in the
countries in which our suppliers and their manufacturers are located (such as the ongoing COVID-19
pandemic), the financial instability of suppliers, suppliers' failure to meet our terms and
conditions or our supplier standards (including our responsible sourcing standards), labor problems
experienced by our suppliers and their manufacturers, the availability of raw materials to suppliers,
merchandise safety and quality issues, disruption or delay in the transportation of merchandise from
the suppliers and manufacturers to our stores, clubs, and other facilities, including as a result of
labor slowdowns at any port at which a material amount of merchandise we purchase enters into the
markets in which we operate, currency exchange rates, transport availability and cost, transport
security, inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are
located are beyond our control.
In addition, the U.S. foreign trade policies, tariffs and other impositions on imported goods, trade
sanctions imposed on certain countries and entities, the limitation on the importation of certain
types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors
relating to foreign trade are beyond our control. These and other factors affecting our suppliers and
our access to products could adversely affect our financial performance.
If the products we sell are not safe or otherwise fail to meet our customers' expectations, we could
lose customers, incur liability for any injuries suffered by customers using or consuming a product
we sell or otherwise experience a material impact to our brand, reputation and financial performance.
We are also subject to reputational and other risks related to third-party sales on our digital
platforms.
Our customers count on us to provide them with safe products. Concerns regarding the safety of food
and non-food products that we source from our suppliers or that we prepare and then sell could cause
customers to avoid purchasing certain products from us, or to seek alternative sources of supply for
all of their food and non-food needs, even if the basis for the concern is outside of our control.
Any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish and
such products also expose us to product liability or food safety claims. As such, any issue regarding
the safety of any food or non-food items we sell, regardless of the cause, could adversely affect our
brand, reputation and financial performance. In addition, third-parties sell goods on some of our
digital platforms, which we refer to as marketplace transactions. Whether laws related to these
marketplace transactions apply to us is currently unsettled and any unfavorable changes could expose
us to loss of sales, reduction in transactions and deterioration of our competitive position. In
addition, we may face reputational, financial and other risks, including liability, for third-party
sales of goods that are controversial, counterfeit, pirated, or stolen, or otherwise fail to comply
with applicable law or the proprietary rights of others. Although we impose contractual terms on
sellers that are intended to prohibit sales of certain type of products, we may not be able to
detect, enforce, or collect sufficient damages for breaches of such agreements. Any of these events
could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations and impede the
execution of our eCommerce growth and flywheel strategy.

We rely extensively on information systems to process transactions, summarize results and manage our
business. Disruptions in our systems could harm our ability to conduct our operations.
Given the number of individual transactions we have each year, it is crucial that we maintain
uninterrupted operation of our business-critical information systems. Our information systems are
subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures,
computer viruses, worms, other malicious computer programs, denial-of-service attacks, security
incidents and breaches (through cyberattacks, which may be from cybercriminals or sophisticated
state-sponsored threat actors), catastrophic events such as fires, major or extended winter storms,
tornadoes, earthquakes and hurricanes, usage errors by our associates or contractors, civil or
political unrest, or armed hostilities. Our information systems are essential to our business
operations, including the processing of transactions, management of our associates, facilities,
logistics, inventories, physical stores and clubs and our online operations. Our information systems
are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. If
our systems are damaged, breached, attacked, or cease to function properly, we may have to make a
significant investment to repair or replace them, and may experience loss or corruption of critical
data as well as suffer interruptions in our business operations in the interim. Any interruption to
our information systems may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.
In addition, we frequently update our information technology hardware, software, processes and
systems. The risk of system disruption is increased when significant system changes are undertaken.
If we fail to timely integrate and update our information systems and processes, we may fail to
realize the cost savings or operational benefits anticipated to be derived from these initiatives.
If the technology-based systems that give our customers the ability to shop with us online do not
function effectively, our operating results, as well as our ability to grow our omni-channel business
globally, could be materially adversely affected.
Increasingly, customers are using computers, tablets, and smart phones to shop with us and with our
competitors and to do comparison shopping. We use social media, online advertising, and email to
interact with our customers and as a means to enhance their shopping experience. As a part of our
omni-channel sales strategy, we offer various pickup, delivery and shipping programs including
options where many products available for purchase online can be picked up by the customer or member
at a local Walmart store or Sam's Club, which provides additional customer traffic at such stores and
clubs. Omni-channel retailing is a rapidly evolving part of the retail industry and of our operations
around the world. We must anticipate and meet our customers' changing expectations while adjusting
for technology investments and developments in our competitors' operations through focusing on the
building and delivery of a seamless shopping experience across all channels by each operating
segment. Any failure on our part to provide attractive, user-friendly secure digital platforms that
offer a wide assortment of merchandise at competitive prices and with low cost and rapid delivery
options and that continually meet the changing expectations of online shoppers and developments in
online and digital platform merchandising and related technology could place us at a competitive
disadvantage, result in the loss of eCommerce and other sales, harm our reputation with customers,
have a material adverse impact on the growth of our eCommerce business globally and have a material
adverse impact on our business and results of operations.
Our digital platforms, which are increasingly important to our business and continue to grow in
complexity and scope, and the systems on which they run, including those applications and systems in
our acquired eCommerce businesses, are regularly subject to cyberattacks. Those attacks involve
attempts to gain unauthorized access to our eCommerce websites (including marketplace platforms) or
mobile commerce applications to obtain and misuse customers' or members' information including
payment information and related risks discussed in this Item 1A . Such attacks, if successful, in
addition to potential data misuse and/or loss, may also create denials of service or otherwise
disable, degrade or sabotage one or more of our digital platforms or otherwise significantly disrupt
our customers' and members' shopping experience, our supply chain integrity and continuity, and our
ability to efficiently operate our business. If we are unable to maintain the security of our digital
platforms and keep them operating within acceptable parameters, we could suffer loss of sales,
reductions in transactions, reputational damage and deterioration of our competitive position and
incur liability for any damage to customers or others whose personal or confidential information is
unlawfully obtained and misused, any of which events could have a material adverse impact on our
business and results of operations and impede the execution of our strategy for the growth of our
business.
Any failure to maintain the privacy or security of the information relating to our company,
customers, members, associates and vendors, whether as a result of cyberattacks on our information
systems or otherwise, could damage our reputation, result in litigation or other legal actions
against us, cause us to incur substantial additional costs, and materially adversely affect our
business and operating results.
Like most retailers, we receive and store in our information systems personal information about our
customers and members, and we receive and store information concerning our associates and vendors.
Some of that information is stored digitally in connection with the digital platforms that we use to
conduct and facilitate our various businesses. In addition, we and our third-party service providers
store and maintain health-related personal information, pharmacy, and medical records in connection
with our health and wellness and pharmacy business. We also utilize third-party service providers for
a variety of reasons, including, without limitation, for digital storage technology, content delivery
to customers and members, back-office support, and other functions. Such providers may have access to
information we hold about our customers, members, associates or
 19 
vendors. In addition, our eCommerce operations depend upon the secure transmission of confidential
information over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments.
Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and those threats and the means for obtaining access to
information in digital and other storage media are becoming increasingly sophisticated and frequent.
Attacks against information systems and devices, whether our own or those of our third-party service
providers, create risk of cybersecurity incidents, including ransomware, malware, phishing incidents.
We expect to continue to experience such attempted attacks in the future. Cyberattacks and threat
actors can be sponsored by particular countries or sophisticated criminal organizations or be the
work of hackers with a wide range of motives and expertise. We and the businesses with which we
interact have experienced and continue to experience threats to data and systems, including by
perpetrators of random or targeted malicious cyberattacks, computer viruses, phishing incidents,
worms, bot attacks, ransomware or other destructive or disruptive software and attempts to
misappropriate customer information, including credit card and payment information, and cause system
failures and disruptions. Mitigation and remediation recommendations continue to evolve, and
addressing vulnerabilities is a priority for us. The increased use of remote work infrastructure due
to the COVID-19 pandemic has also increased the possible attack surfaces. Some of our systems and
third-party service providers' systems have experienced security incidents or breaches and although
they did not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, there can be no assurance of a
similar result in the future.
Associate error or malfeasance, faulty password management, social engineering or other
vulnerabilities and irregularities may also result in a defeat of our or our third-party service
providers' security measures and a compromise or breach of our or their information systems.
Moreover, hardware, software or applications we use may have inherent vulnerabilities or defects of
design, manufacture or operations or could be inadvertently or intentionally implemented or used in a
manner that could compromise information security.
Any compromise of our data security systems or of those of businesses with which we interact, which
results in confidential information being accessed, obtained, damaged, disclosed, destroyed,
modified, lost or used by unauthorized persons could harm our reputation and expose us to regulatory
actions (including, with respect to health information, liability under the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or "HIPAA"), customer attrition, remediation expenses,
and claims from customers, members, associates, vendors, financial institutions, payment card
networks and other persons, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business
operations, financial position and results of operations. Because the techniques used to obtain
unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may not
immediately produce signs of a compromise, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to
implement adequate preventative measures and we or our third-party service providers may not discover
any security event, breach, vulnerability or compromise of information for a significant period of
time after the security incident occurs. To the extent that any cyberattack, ransomware or incursion
in our or one of our third-party service provider's information systems results in the loss, damage,
misappropriation or other compromise of information, we may be materially adversely affected by
claims from customers, financial institutions, regulatory authorities, payment card networks and
others.
Our compliance programs, information technology, and enterprise risk management efforts cannot
eliminate all systemic risk. Disruptions in our systems caused by security incidents, breaches or
cyberattacks – including attacks on those parties we do business with (such as strategic partners,
suppliers, banks, or utility companies) – could harm our ability to conduct our operations, which may
have a material effect on us, may result in losses that could have a material adverse effect on our
financial position or results of operations, or may have a cascading effect that adversely impacts
our partners, third-party service providers, customers, financial services firms, and other third
parties that we interact with on a regular basis.
In addition, such security-related events could be widely publicized and could materially adversely
affect our reputation with our customers, members, associates, vendors and shareholders, could harm
our competitive position particularly with respect to our eCommerce operations, and could result in a
material reduction in our net sales in our eCommerce operations, as well as in our stores thereby
materially adversely affecting our operations, net sales, results of operations, financial position,
cash flows and liquidity. Such events could also result in the release to the public of confidential
information about our operations and financial position and performance and could result in
litigation or other legal actions against us or the imposition of penalties, fines, fees or
liabilities, which may not be covered by our insurance policies. Moreover, a security compromise or
ransomware event could require us to devote significant management resources to address the problems
created by the issue and to expend significant additional resources to upgrade further the security
measures we employ to guard personal and confidential information against cyberattacks and other
attempts to access or otherwise compromise such information and could result in a disruption of our
operations, particularly our digital operations.
We accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash, checks, credit and debit cards, and
our private label credit cards and gift cards, and we may offer new payment options over time, which
may have information security risk implications. As a retailer accepting debit and credit cards for
payment, we are subject to various industry data protection standards and protocols, such as payment
network security operating guidelines and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. We cannot
be certain that the security measures we maintain to protect all of our information technology
systems are able to prevent, contain or detect cyberattacks, cyberterrorism, security incidents,
breaches, or other compromises from known malware or ransomware or other threats that may be
developed in the future. In certain circumstances, our contracts with
 20 
payment card processors and payment card networks (such as Visa, Mastercard, American Express and
Discover) generally require us to adhere to payment card network rules which could make us liable to
payment card issuers and others if information in connection with payment cards and payment card
transactions that we process is compromised, which liabilities could be substantial.
Additionally, through various financial service partners, we offer money transfers, digital payment
platforms, bill payment, money orders, check cashing, prepaid access, co-branded credits cards,
installment lending, and earned wage access. These products and services require us to comply with
legal and regulatory requirements, including global anti-money laundering and sanctions laws and
regulations as well as international, federal and state consumer financial laws and regulations.
Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines, sanctions, penalties and
harm to our reputation.
The Company also has compliance obligations associated with privacy laws enacted to protect and
regulate the collection, use, retention, disclosure and transfer of personal information, which
include liability for security and privacy breaches. Among other obligations, breaches may trigger
obligations under federal and state laws to notify affected individuals, government agencies and the
media. Consequently, cybersecurity attacks that cause a data breach could subject us to fines,
sanctions and other legal liability and harm our reputation.
Changes in the results of our health and wellness business could adversely affect our overall results
of operations, cash flows and liquidity.
Walmart has retail pharmacy operations in our Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments, as well as the
recent addition of Walmart Health locations in a number of states which offer medical, dental,
optometry, immunizations, and other health services. A large majority of our retail pharmacy net
sales are generated by filling prescriptions for which we receive payment through established
contractual relationships with third-party payers and payment administrators, such as private
insurers, governmental agencies and pharmacy benefit managers ("PBMs").
These operations are subject to numerous risks, including: reductions in the third-party
reimbursement rates for drugs; changes in our payer mix (i.e., shifts in the relative distribution of
our pharmacy customers across drug insurance plans and programs toward plans and programs with less
favorable reimbursement terms); changes in third-party payer drug formularies (i.e., the schedule of
prescription drugs approved for reimbursement or which otherwise receive preferential coverage
treatment); growth in, and our participation in or exclusion from, pharmacy payer network
arrangements including exclusive and preferred pharmacy network arrangements operated by PBMs and/or
any insurance plan or program; increases in the prices we pay for brand name and generic prescription
drugs we sell; increases in the administrative burdens associated with seeking third-party
reimbursement; changes in the frequency with which new brand name pharmaceuticals become available to
consumers; introduction of lower cost generic drugs as substitutes for existing brand name drugs for
which there was no prior generic drug competition; changes in drug mix (i.e., the relative
distribution of drugs customers purchase at our pharmacies between brands and generics); changes in
the health insurance market generally; changes in the scope of or the elimination of Medicare Part D
or Medicaid drug programs; increased competition from other retail pharmacy operations including
competitors offering online retail pharmacy options with or without home delivery options; further
consolidation and strategic alliances among third-party payers, PBMs or purchasers of drugs; overall
economic conditions and the ability of our pharmacy customers to pay for drugs prescribed for them to
the extent the costs are not reimbursed by a third-party; failure to meet any performance or
incentive thresholds to which our level of third-party reimbursement may be subject; changes in laws
or regulations or the practices of third-party payers and PBMs related to the use of third-party
financial assistance to assist our pharmacy customers with paying for drugs prescribed for them; and
any additional changes in the regulatory environment for the retail pharmacy industry and the
pharmaceutical industry, including as a result of restrictions on the further implementation of or
the repeal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or the enactment and implementation of a
law replacing such act, and other changes in laws, rules and regulations that affect our retail
pharmacy business.
If the supply of certain pharmaceuticals provided by one or more of our vendors were to be disrupted
for any reason, our pharmacy operations could be severely affected until at least such time as we
could obtain a new supplier for such pharmaceuticals. Any such disruption could cause reputational
damage and result in a significant number of our pharmacy customers transferring their prescriptions
to other pharmacies.
One or a combination of such factors may adversely affect the volumes of brand name and generic
pharmaceuticals we sell, our cost of sales associated with our retail pharmacy operations, and the
net sales and gross margin of those operations or result in the loss of cross-store or cross-club
selling opportunities and, in turn, adversely affect our overall net sales, other results of
operations, cash flows and liquidity.
Our failure to attract and retain qualified associates, increases in wage and benefit costs, changes
in laws and other labor issues could materially adversely affect our financial performance.
Our ability to continue to conduct and expand our operations depends on our ability to attract and
retain a large and growing number of qualified associates globally. Our ability to meet our labor
needs, including our ability to find qualified personnel to fill positions that become vacant at our
existing stores, clubs, distribution and fulfillment centers and corporate offices, while
 21 
controlling our associate wage and related labor costs, is generally subject to numerous external
factors, including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force of
the markets in which we operate, unemployment levels within those markets, prevailing wage rates,
changing demographics, health and other insurance costs and adoption of new or revised employment and
labor laws and regulations. Additionally, our ability to successfully execute organizational changes,
including management transitions within the Company's senior leadership, and to effectively motivate
and retain associates are critical to our business success. If we are unable to locate, attract or
retain qualified personnel, or manage leadership transition successfully, the quality of service we
provide to our customers may decrease and our financial performance may be adversely affected.
In addition, if our costs of labor or related costs increase for other reasons or if new or revised
labor laws, rules or regulations or healthcare laws are adopted or implemented that further increase
our labor costs, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected.
 Financial Risks 
Failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance could adversely affect the market
price and volatility of our stock.
We believe that the price of our stock generally reflects high market expectations for our future
operating results. Any failure to meet or delay in meeting these expectations, including our
consolidated net sales, consolidated operating income, capital expenditures, comparable store and
club sales growth rates, eCommerce growth rates, gross margin, or earnings and adjusted earnings per
share could cause the market price of our stock to decline, as could changes in our dividend or stock
repurchase programs or policies, changes in our effective tax rates, changes in our financial
estimates and recommendations by securities analysts or, failure of Walmart's performance to compare
favorably to that of other retailers may have a negative effect on the price of our stock.
Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may materially adversely affect our financial performance and
our reported results of operations.
Our operations in countries other than the U.S. are conducted primarily in the local currencies of
those countries. Our Consolidated Financial Statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, and to
prepare those financial statements we must translate the amounts of the assets, liabilities, net
sales, other revenues and expenses of our operations outside of the U.S. from local currencies into
U.S. dollars using exchange rates for the current period. In recent years, fluctuations in currency
exchange rates that were unfavorable have had adverse effects on our reported results of operations.
As a result of such translations, fluctuations in currency exchange rates from period-to-period that
are unfavorable to us may also result in our Consolidated Financial Statements reflecting significant
adverse period-over-period changes in our financial performance or reflecting a period-over-period
improvement in our financial performance that is not as robust as it would be without such
fluctuations in the currency exchange rates. Such unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations
will adversely affect the reported performance of our Walmart International operating segment and
have a corresponding adverse effect on our reported consolidated results of operations.
We may pay for products we purchase for sale in our stores and clubs around the world with a currency
other than the local currency of the country in which the goods will be sold. When we must acquire
the currency to pay for such products and the exchange rates for the payment currency fluctuate in a
manner unfavorable to us, our cost of sales may increase and we may be unable or unwilling to change
the prices at which we sell those goods to address that increase in our costs, with a corresponding
adverse effect on our gross profit. Consequently, unfavorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates
have and may continue to adversely affect our results of operations.
Legal, Tax, Regulatory, Compliance, Reputational and Other Risks
Our international operations subject us to legislative, judicial, accounting, legal, regulatory, tax,
political and economic risks and conditions specific to the countries or regions in which we operate,
which could materially adversely affect our business or financial performance.
In addition to our U.S. operations, we operate our retail business in Africa, Canada, Central
America, Chile, China, India and Mexico.
During fiscal 2022, our Walmart International operations generated approximately 18% of our
consolidated net sales. Walmart International's operations in various countries also source goods and
services from other countries. Our future operating results in these countries could be negatively
affected by a variety of factors, most of which are beyond our control. These factors include
political conditions, including political instability, local and global economic conditions, legal
and regulatory constraints (such as regulation of product and service offerings including regulatory
restrictions (such as foreign ownership restrictions) on eCommerce and retail operations in
international markets, such as India), restrictive governmental actions (such as trade protection
measures), antitrust and competition law regulatory matters (such as the competition investigations
currently
 22 
underway in Mexico related to our subsidiary Wal-Mart de Mexico, in Canada related to our subsidiary
Wal-Mart Canada and competition proceedings in India related to our Flipkart subsidiary), local
product safety and environmental laws, tax regulations, local labor laws, anti-money laundering laws
and regulations, trade policies, currency regulations, laws and regulations regarding consumer and
data protection, and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate, now or in
the future.
The economies of some of the countries in which we have operations have in the past suffered from
high rates of inflation and currency devaluations, which, if they occurred again, could adversely
affect our financial performance. Other factors which may impact our international operations include
foreign trade, monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. and of other countries, laws, regulations and
other activities of foreign governments, agencies and similar organizations, and risks associated
with having numerous facilities located in countries that have historically been less stable than the
U.S. Additional risks inherent in our international operations generally include, among others, the
costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences and greater
difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights in countries other than the U.S. The various
risks inherent in doing business in the U.S. generally also exist when doing business outside of the
U.S., and may be exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions
due to differences in culture, laws and regulations.
In foreign countries in which we have operations, a risk exists that our associates, contractors or
agents could, in contravention of our policies, engage in business practices prohibited by U.S. laws
and regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or the laws and
regulations of other countries. We maintain a global policy prohibiting such business practices and
have in place a global anti-corruption compliance program designed to ensure compliance with these
laws and regulations. Nevertheless, we remain subject to the risk that one or more of our associates,
contractors or agents, including those based in or from countries where practices that violate such
U.S. laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries may be customary, will
engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies, circumvent our compliance programs
and, by doing so, violate such laws and regulations. Any such violations, even if prohibited by our
internal policies, could adversely affect our business or financial performance and our reputation.
Changes in tax and trade laws and regulations could materially adversely affect our financial
performance.
In fiscal 2022, our Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club operating segments generated approximately 82% of our
consolidated net sales. Significant changes in tax and trade policies, including tariffs and
government regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries where we source many of
the products we sell in our stores and clubs could have an adverse effect on our business and
financial performance. A significant portion of the general merchandise we sell in our U.S. stores
and clubs is manufactured in other countries. Any such actions including the imposition of further
tariffs on imports could increase the cost to us of such merchandise (whether imported directly or
indirectly) and cause increases in the prices at which we sell such merchandise to our customers,
which could materially adversely affect the financial performance of our U.S. operations and our
business.
We are subject to income taxes and other taxes in both the U.S. and the foreign jurisdictions in
which we currently operate or have historically operated. The determination of our worldwide
provision for income taxes and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities requires judgment and
estimation. Our income taxes could be materially adversely affected by earnings being lower than
anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in
jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax
assets and liabilities, or by changes in worldwide tax laws, tax rates, regulations or accounting
principles.
We are also exposed to future tax legislation, as well as the issuance of future regulations and
changes in administrative interpretations of existing tax laws, any of which can impact our current
and future years' tax provision. The effect of such changes in tax law could have a material effect
on our business, financial position and results of operations. In the U.S., the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
of 2017 (the "Tax Act") significantly changed federal income tax laws that affect U.S. corporations.
As further guidance is issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting
bodies, any resulting changes in our estimates will be treated in accordance with the relevant
accounting guidance. Compliance with the Tax Act and any other new tax rules, regulations, guidance,
and interpretations, including collecting information not regularly produced by the Company or
unexpected changes in our estimates, may require us to incur additional costs and could affect our
results of operations.
In addition, legislatures and taxing authorities in many jurisdictions in which we operate may enact
changes to their tax rules. These changes could include modifications that have temporary effect and
more permanent changes. The impact of these potential new rules as well as any other changes in
domestic and international tax rules and regulations could have a material effect on our effective
tax rate.
Furthermore, we are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities
as well as subject to the prospective and retrospective effects of changing tax regulations and
legislation. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may
materially differ from the tax amounts recorded in our Consolidated Financial
 23 
Statements and may materially affect our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the
period or periods for which such determination and settlement is made.
Changes in and/or failure to comply with other laws, regulations, and interpretations of such laws
and regulations specific to the businesses and jurisdictions in which we operate could materially
adversely affect our reputation, market position, or our business and financial performance.
We operate in complex regulated environments in the U.S. and in the other countries in which we
operate and could be adversely affected by changes to existing legal requirements including the
related interpretations and enforcement practices, new legal requirements and/or any failure to
comply with applicable regulations.
Our operations in the U.S. are subject to numerous federal, state and local regulations including
licensing and other requirements and reimbursement arrangements affecting our health and wellness
operations. The laws and regulations to which we are subject include, but are not limited to: federal
and state registration and regulation of pharmacies; dispensing and sale of controlled substances and
products containing pseudoephedrine; applicable governmental payer regulations including Medicare and
Medicaid; data privacy and security laws and regulations including the Health Insurance Portability
and Accountability Act and the Affordable Care Act; laws and regulations relating to the protection
of the environment and health and safety matters, including those governing exposure to, and the
management and disposal of, hazardous substances; regulations regarding food and drug safety
including those of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the "FDA") and the Drug Enforcement
Administration (the "DEA"); trade regulations including those of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission,
the U.S. Department of the Treasury, and consumer protection and safety regulations including those
of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, as well as state regulatory authorities, governing the
availability, sale, advertisement and promotion of products we sell and the financial services we
offer (including through our digital channels and stores and clubs as well as our previously
announced fintech joint venture); anti-kickback laws; anti-money laundering laws; consumer financial
protection laws; the Office of Foreign Assets Control regulations; false claims laws; patient
inducement regulations; and federal and state laws governing health care fraud and abuse, quality and
standards of medical equipment, and the qualifications and practice of the professions of medical,
pharmacy, optical care and health care services.
For example, in the U.S., the DEA and various other regulatory authorities regulate the purchase,
distribution, maintenance and dispensing of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances. We are
required to hold valid DEA and state-level licenses, meet various security and operating standards
and comply with the federal and various state controlled substance acts and related regulations
governing the sale, dispensing, disposal and holding of controlled substances. The DEA, the FDA and
state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers, including the ability to seize or recall
products and impose significant criminal, civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these
laws and regulations. In addition, other health-related legislation at the federal and state level
may have an adverse effect on our business or require us to modify certain aspects of our operations.
Also, upon the successful completion of the previously announced pending acquisitions by our fintech
joint venture, there may be an increased degree of scrutiny by financial regulatory authorities over
the newly acquired fintech related businesses, which may result in higher operational costs and an
increased possibility for fines and penalties if there is non-compliance with the applicable laws and
regulations.
We are also governed by foreign, national and state laws and regulations of general applicability,
including laws and regulations related to working conditions, health and safety, equal employment
opportunity, employee benefit and other labor and employment matters, laws and regulations related to
competition and antitrust matters, and health and wellness related regulations for our pharmacy
operations outside of the U.S. Increasing governmental and societal attention to ESG matters,
including expanding mandatory and voluntary reporting diligence, and disclosure topics such as
climate change, sustainability (including with respect to our supply chain), natural resources, waste
reduction, energy, human capital, and risk oversight could expand the nature, scope, and complexity
of matters that we are required to control, assess, and report. In addition, certain financial
services we offer or make available are subject to legal and regulatory requirements, including those
intended to help detect and prevent money laundering, fraud and other illicit activity as well as
consumer financial protections laws and U.S. sanctions. We are also subject to data privacy and
protection laws regulating the collection, use, retention, disclosure, transfer and processing of
personal information, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA"), which was significantly
modified by the California Privacy Rights Act ("CPRA"), new comprehensive privacy legislation passed
in 2021 in Virginia and Colorado, as well as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation
("GDPR") and China's Personal Information Protection Act. The potential effects of these laws are
far-reaching and may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur
substantial costs and expenses to comply. In the case of non-compliance with a material provision of
the GDPR (such as non-adherence to the core principles of processing personal data), regulators have
the authority to levy a fine in an amount that is up to the greater of €20 million or 4% of global
annual turnover in the prior year. These administrative fines are discretionary and based, in each
case, on a multi-factored approach. Residents in jurisdictions with comprehensive privacy laws have
expanded rights to access, correct and require deletion of their personal information, opt out of
certain personal information sharing and receive detailed information about how their personal
information is used. The CCPA and CPRA provide for civil penalties for violations, as well as a
private right of action for data breaches. Furthermore, our marketing and customer engagement
activities are subject to communications privacy laws such as the Telephone Consumer
 24 
Protection Act. We may be subjected to penalties and other consequences for noncompliance, including
changing some portions of our business. Even an unsuccessful challenge by customer or regulatory
authorities of our activities could result in adverse publicity and could require a costly response
from and defense by us.
The impact of new laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations, as well as changes
in enforcement practices or regulatory scrutiny generally cannot be predicted, and changes in
applicable laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices
may require extensive system and operational changes, be difficult to implement, increase our
operating costs, require significant capital expenditures, or adversely impact the cost or
attractiveness of the products or services we offer, or result in adverse publicity and harm our
reputation. If we fail to respond adequately to changes, including by implementing strategic and
operational initiatives, or do not respond as effectively as our competitors, our business,
operations, and financial performance may be adversely affected.
While we strive to adhere our practices and procedures to these laws, they are subject to evolving
regulations, interpretations, enforcement priorities of regulatory authorities, and regulator
discretion. The regulatory, political, and media scrutiny we face, which may continue, amplifies
these risks. We may face audits or investigations by one or more government agencies relating to our
compliance with applicable laws and regulations. To the extent a regulator or court disagrees with
our interpretation of these laws and determines that our practices are not in compliance with
applicable laws and regulations, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties that could
adversely affect the continued operation of our businesses, including: suspension of payments from
government programs; loss of required government certifications; loss of authorizations to
participate in or exclusion from government programs, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs in
the U.S.; loss of licenses; termination from contractual relationships, including those with our drug
suppliers and third-party payers; and significant fines or monetary damages and/or criminal and civil
penalties. Failure to comply with applicable legal or regulatory requirements in the U.S. or in any
of the countries in which we operate could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage
to our reputation, and have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial position
and results of operations.
We are subject to risks related to litigation and other legal proceedings that may materially
adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and liquidity.
We operate in a highly regulated and litigious environment. We are involved in legal proceedings,
including litigation, arbitration and other claims, and investigations, inspections, audits, claims,
inquiries and similar actions by pharmacy, healthcare, tax, environmental and other governmental
authorities. We may also have indemnification obligations for legal commitments of certain businesses
we have divested. Legal proceedings, in general, and securities, derivative action and class action
and multi-district litigation, in particular, can be expensive and disruptive. Some of these suits
may purport or may be determined to be class actions and/or involve parties seeking large and/or
indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages, and may remain unresolved for several
years. For example, we are currently a defendant in a number of cases containing class or collective-
action allegations, or both, in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state wage
and hour laws, as well as a number of cases containing class-action allegations in which the
plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state consumer laws.
The Company has also been responding to subpoenas, information requests and investigations from
governmental entities related to nationwide controlled substance dispensing and distribution
practices involving opioids and is also a defendant in numerous litigation proceedings related to
opioids, including the consolidated multidistrict litigation entitled In re National Prescription
Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) currently pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern
District of Ohio. Similar cases that name the Company have also been filed in state courts by state,
local and tribal governments, health care providers and other plaintiffs. Plaintiffs are seeking
compensatory and punitive damages, as well as injunctive relief including abatement. On October 22,
2020, the Company filed a declaratory judgment action in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern
District of Texas against the U.S. Department of Justice (the "DOJ") and the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration, asking a federal court to clarify the roles and responsibilities of pharmacists and
pharmacies as to the dispensing and distribution of opioids under the Controlled Substances Act (the
"CSA"). The Company's action was dismissed. The Company appealed this decision to the Fifth Circuit.
On December 22, 2021, the Fifth Circuit affirmed the dismissal of the action. On December 22, 2020,
the DOJ filed a civil complaint against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the District of
Delaware alleging that the Company unlawfully dispensed controlled substances from its pharmacies and
unlawfully distributed controlled substances to those pharmacies in violation of the CSA. The DOJ is
seeking civil penalties and injunctive relief. The Company filed a motion to dismiss the DOJ
complaint on February 22, 2021. Since that time, the District Court stayed further proceedings in the
DOJ complaint pending the decision of the United States Supreme Court in two other cases interpreting
the CSA, which have been consolidated into Ruan v. United States , 142 S. Ct. 457 (2021).
In addition, the Company is the subject of a consolidated securities class action alleging violations
of the federal securities laws regarding the Company's disclosures with respect to opioids filed in
the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware on January 20, 2021 purportedly on behalf of a
class of investors who acquired Walmart stock from March 30, 2016 through December 22, 2020. On May
11, 2021 the U.S. District Court in Delaware consolidated the class actions and appointed a lead
plaintiff and lead counsel. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated securities
class action on October 8, 2021; the lead plaintiff responded to the motion on January 10, 2022; and
the defendants filed their reply brief on February 10, 2022.
 25 
Two derivative actions were also filed by certain of the Company's shareholders in the U.S. District
Court for the District of Delaware on February 9, 2021 and April 16, 2021 alleging breach of
fiduciary duties against certain of the Company's current and former directors with respect to
oversight of the Company's distribution and dispensing of opioids, and those suits have been stayed
pending further developments in other Opioids litigation matters.
Other shareholders filed a third derivative action making similar allegations in the Delaware Court
of Chancery on September 27, 2021. The defendants in this derivative suit filed the opening brief on
their motion to dismiss that case on December 21, 2021; and the plaintiffs responded by filing an
amended complaint on February 22, 2022.
The Company cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, and cannot reasonably
estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from such claims and the related opioid matters.
We discuss these cases and other litigation to which we are party below under the caption " Item 3.
Legal Proceedings " and in Note 10 in the " Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements ," which
are part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Our amended and restated bylaws designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole
and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our
shareholders, which could increase the costs for our shareholders to bring claims, discourage our
shareholders from bringing claims, or limit our shareholders' ability to obtain a favorable judicial
forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, associates or shareholders in such capacity.
Our bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole
and exclusive forum for claims, including derivative claims that are based upon a violation of a duty
by a current or former director, officer, associate or shareholder in such capacity or as to which
the Delaware General Corporation Law confers jurisdiction upon the Court of Chancery. The exclusive
forum provision may increase the costs for a shareholder to bring a claim or limit a shareholder's
ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that the shareholder finds favorable for disputes with
us or our directors, officers, associates or shareholders in such capacity, which may discourage such
lawsuits against us and such persons. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our
bylaws inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, the claims as to which they are intended to
apply, then we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other
jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial position or results of
operations. While the exclusive forum provision applies to state and federal law claims, our
shareholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with, and the exclusive forum provision
will not preclude or contract the scope of exclusive federal or concurrent jurisdiction for actions
brought under, the federal securities laws, including the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, or the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder.
Our reputation may be adversely affected if we are not able to achieve our ESG goals.
We strive to deliver shared value through our business and our diverse stakeholders expect us to make
significant progress in certain ESG priority issue areas. From time to time, we announce certain
aspirations and goals relevant to our priority ESG issues. We periodically publish information about
our ESG priorities, strategies, and progress on our corporate website and update our ESG reporting
from time to time. Achievement of these aspirations and goals is subject to risks and uncertainties,
many of which are outside of our control, and it is possible that we may fail, or be perceived to
have failed, in the achievement of our ESG goals or certain of our customers, associates,
shareholders, investors, suppliers, business partners, government agencies, and non-governmental
organizations might not be satisfied with our efforts. Certain challenges we face in the achievement
of our ESG objectives are also captured within our ESG reporting, which is not incorporated by
reference into and does not form any part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. A failure or perceived
failure to meet our goals could adversely affect public perception of our business, associate morale
or customer or shareholder support.

We own office facilities in Bentonville, Arkansas, that serve as our principal office and own and
lease office facilities throughout the U.S. and internationally for operations as well as for field
and market management. The land on which our stores are located is either owned or leased by the
Company. We use independent contractors to construct our buildings. All store leases provide for
annual rentals, some of which escalate during the original lease or provide for additional rent based
on sales volume. Substantially all of the Company's store and club leases have renewal options, some
of which include rent escalation clauses. For further information on our distribution centers, see
the caption "Distribution" provided for each of our segments under " Item 1. Business ."

 ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
I. SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION: We discuss certain legal proceedings in Note 10 to our Consolidated
Financial Statements included in " Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data ," which is
captioned "Contingencies," under the sub-caption "Legal Proceedings." We refer you to that discussion
for important information concerning those legal proceedings, including the basis for such actions
and, where known, the relief sought. We provide the following additional information concerning those
legal proceedings, including the name of the lawsuit, the court in which the lawsuit is pending, and
the date on which the petition commencing the lawsuit was filed.
Prescription Opiate Litigation: In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) (the
"MDL"). The MDL is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio and includes
over 2,150 cases as of March 4, 2022. The liability phase of a trial in one of the MDL cases began on
October 4, 2021 against a number of parties, including the Company, regarding opioid dispensing
claims. On November 23, 2021, the jury found in favor of the plaintiffs as to the liability of all
defendants, including the Company. The abatement phase of the trial, which will determine amounts
owed by the defendants, is currently scheduled to begin on May 10, 2022. The Company intends to
appeal the jury verdict from the liability phase upon completion of the abatement phase of the trial.
There is one case in which the Company is named as a defendant that was remanded from the MDL court
to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma ( The Cherokee Nation v. CVS
Pharmacy, Inc., et al. , Case No. CIV-18-56-RAW-SPS (E.D. Okla.)). This case was brought by the
Cherokee Nation. Certain motions have been filed by the parties to this case, and the case is
currently stayed pending a ruling on those motions. In addition, there are over 225 state court cases
pending as of March 4, 2022, some of which may be removed to federal court to seek MDL transfer. The
case citations for the state cases are listed on Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 10-K.
DOJ Opioid Civil Litigation: On October 22, 2020, the Company filed a declaratory judgment action in
the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas against the U.S. Department of Justice (the
"DOJ") and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, asking a federal court to clarify the roles and
responsibilities of pharmacists and pharmacies as to the dispensing and distribution of opioids under
the Controlled Substances Act (the "CSA") . The Company's action, Walmart Inc. v. U.S. Department of
Justice et al., USDC, Eastern Dist. of Texas, 10/22/20, was dismissed. The Company had appealed this
decision to the Fifth Circuit. On December 22, 2021, the Fifth Circuit affirmed the dismissal of the
action. A civil complaint pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware has been
filed by the DOJ against the Company, in which the DOJ alleges violations of the CSA related to
nationwide distribution and dispensing of opioids. U.S. v. Walmart Inc., et al ., USDC, Dist. of DE,
12/22/20. The Company filed a motion to dismiss the DOJ complaint on February 22, 2021. The DOJ filed
its opposition brief on April 23, 2021 and the Company filed its reply brief on May 24, 2021. On
November 19, 2021, the District Court stayed further proceedings in the DOJ complaint pending the
decision of the United States Supreme Court in two other cases interpreting the CSA, which have been
consolidated into Ruan v. United States , 142 S. Ct. 457 (2021).
Opioids Related Securities Class Actions and Derivative Litigation : Three derivative complaints and
two securities class actions drawing heavily on the allegations of the DOJ complaint have been filed
in Delaware naming the Company and various current and former directors and certain current and
former officers as defendants. The plaintiffs in the derivative suits (in which the Company is a
nominal defendant) allege, among other things, that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties in
connection with oversight of opioids dispensing and distribution and that the defendants violated
Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and are liable
for contribution under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act in connection with the Company's disclosures
about opioids. Two of the derivative suits have been filed in the U.S. District Court in Delaware and
those suits have been stayed pending further developments in other Opioids litigation matters. The
other derivative suit has been filed in the Chancery Court in Delaware. The securities class actions,
alleging violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act regarding the Company's
disclosures with respect to opioids, were purportedly filed on behalf of a class of investors who
acquired Walmart stock from March 30, 2016 through December 22, 2020. On May 11, 2021, the U.S.
District Court in Delaware consolidated the class actions and appointed a lead plaintiff and lead
counsel. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated securities class action on October
8, 2021; the lead plaintiff responded to the motion on January 10, 2022; and the defendants filed
their reply brief on February 10, 2022. The defendants in the derivative suit pending in Delaware
Chancery Court filed the opening brief on their motion to dismiss that case on December 21, 2021; and
the plaintiffs responded by filing an amended complaint on February 22, 2022.
Derivative Lawsuits: Abt v. Alvarez et al. , USDC, Dist. of DE, 2/9/21; Nguyen v. McMillon et al.,
USDC, Dist. of DE, 4/16/21: Ontario Provincial Council of Carpenters' Pension Trust Fund et al. v.
Walton et al., DE Court of Chancery, 9/27/21.
Securities Class Actions: Stanton v. Walmart Inc. et al. , USDC, Dist. of DE, 1/20/21 and Martin v.
Walmart Inc. et al., USDC , Dist. of DE, 3/5/21, consolidated into In re Walmart Inc. Securities
Litigation , USDC, Dist. of DE, 5/11/21.

II. CERTAIN OTHER MATTERS:
Asda Equal Value Claims: Ms S Brierley & Others v ASDA Stores Ltd (2406372/2008 & Others - Manchester
Employment Tribunal); ASDA Stores Ltd v Brierley & Ors (A2/2016/0973 - United Kingdom Court of
Appeal); ASDA Stores Ltd v Ms S Brierley & Others (UKEAT/0059/16/DM - United Kingdom Employment
Appeal Tribunal); ASDA Stores Ltd v Ms S Brierley & Others (UKEAT/0009/16/JOJ - United Kingdom
Employment Appeal Tribunal).
Money Transfer Agent Services Proceedings: The Company has received grand jury subpoenas issued by
the United States Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Pennsylvania seeking documents
regarding the Company's consumer fraud program and anti-money laundering compliance related to the
Company's money transfer services, where Walmart is an agent. The most recent subpoena was issued in
August 2020. The Company has been responding to these subpoenas and is cooperating with the
government's investigation. The Company has also responded to civil investigative demands from the
United States Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") in connection with the FTC's investigation related
to money transfers and the Company's anti-fraud program in its capacity as an agent. While the
Company had been engaged in discussions with the FTC regarding a potential resolution of this matter,
the parties have not been able to reach a resolution. In November 2021, the FTC Bureau of Consumer
Protection forwarded a draft civil complaint to the FTC seeking authority to file a complaint against
the Company seeking various forms of monetary and injunctive relief. The FTC is currently considering
whether to grant such authorization. The Company is unable to predict the outcome of the
investigations or any related actions by the governmental entities regarding these matters at this
time. While the Company does not currently believe that the outcome of these matters will have a
material adverse effect on its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows, the
Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of these matters and whether its
business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely
affected.
Foreign Direct Investment Matters: In July 2021, the Directorate of Enforcement in India issued a
show cause notice to Flipkart Private Limited and one of its subsidiaries ("Flipkart"), and to
unrelated companies and individuals, including certain current and former shareholders and directors
of Flipkart. The notice requests the recipients to show cause as to why further proceedings under
India's Foreign Direct Investment rules and regulations (the "Rules") should not be initiated against
them based on alleged violations during the period from 2009 to 2015, prior to the Company's
acquisition of a majority stake in Flipkart in 2018. The notice is an initial stage of proceedings
under the Rules which could, depending upon the conclusions at the end of the initial stage, lead to
a hearing to consider the merits of the allegations described in the notice. If a hearing is
initiated and if it is determined that violations of the Rules occurred, the regulatory authority has
the authority to impose monetary and/or non-monetary relief. Flipkart has begun the process of
responding to the notice and, if the matter progresses to a consideration of the merits of the
allegations described in the notice is initiated, Flipkart intends to defend against the allegations
vigorously. Due to the fact that this process is in an early stage, the Company is unable to predict
whether the notice will lead to a hearing on the merits or, if it does, the final outcome of the
resulting proceedings. While the Company does not currently believe that this matter will have a
material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows,
the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope or outcome of any proceeding that might result
from the notice, the amount of the proceeds the Company may receive in indemnification from
individuals and entities that sold shares to the Company under the 2018 agreement pursuant to which
the Company acquired its majority stake in Flipkart, or whether the Company's business, financial
position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected.
III. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS: Item 103 of SEC Regulation S-K requires disclosure of certain
environmental matters when a governmental authority is a party to the proceedings and such
proceedings involve potential monetary sanctions that the Company reasonably believes will exceed an
applied threshold not to exceed $1 million.
In June 2021, the Company signed a tolling agreement with the Office of the Attorney General of the
State of California to toll the statute of limitations for potential claims regarding Walmart's
management of waste consumer products at its California facilities that are alleged to be hazardous.
In December 2021, the Office of the Attorney General of the State of California filed suit against
the Company, bringing enforcement claims regarding Walmart's management of waste consumer products at
its California facilities that are alleged to be hazardous. The Company believes the suit is without
merit and is vigorously defending this litigation matter. While the Company cannot predict the
ultimate outcome of this matter, the potential for penalties or settlement costs could exceed $1
million. Although the Company does not believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect
on its business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, the Company can provide no
assurance as to the scope and outcome of these matters and whether its business, financial position,
results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected.
