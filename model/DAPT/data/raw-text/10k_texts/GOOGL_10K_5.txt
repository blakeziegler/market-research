│ BUSINESS │
 Overview 
As our founders Larry and Sergey wrote in the original founders' letter, "Google is not a
conventional company. We do not intend to become one." That unconventional spirit has been a driving
force throughout our history, inspiring us to tackle big problems, and invest in moonshots like
artificial intelligence ("AI") research and quantum computing. We continue this work under the
leadership of Sundar Pichai, who has served as CEO of Google since 2015 and as CEO of Alphabet since
2019.
Alphabet is a collection of businesses — the largest of which is Google — which we report as two
segments: Google Services and Google Cloud. We report all non-Google businesses collectively as Other
Bets. Our Other Bets include earlier stage technologies that are further afield from our core Google
business. We take a long term view and manage the portfolio of Other Bets with the discipline and
rigor needed to deliver long-term returns. Our Alphabet structure is about helping each of our
businesses prosper through strong leaders and independence.
 Access and technology for everyone 
The Internet is one of the world’s most powerful equalizers, capable of propelling new ideas and
people forward. Our mission to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible
and useful is as relevant today as it was when we were founded in 1998. Since then, we’ve evolved
from a company that helps people find answers to a company that helps you get things done. We’re
focused on building an even more helpful Google for everyone, and we aspire to give everyone the
tools they need to increase their knowledge, health, happiness and success.
Across Alphabet, we're focused on continually innovating in areas where technology can have an impact
on people’s lives. Every year, there are trillions of searches on Google, and we continue to invest
deeply in AI and other technologies to ensure the most helpful Search experience possible. People
come to YouTube for entertainment, information and opportunities to learn something new. And Google
Assistant offers the best way to get things done seamlessly across different devices, providing
intelligent help throughout your day, no matter where you are.
Since the pandemic began, our teams have built new features to help users go about their daily lives,
and to support businesses working to serve their customers during an uncertain time. In conjunction
with Apple, we launched Exposure Notification apps that are being used by local governments globally.
Our COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports are used by public health agencies and researchers around the
globe, and we’ve committed hundreds of millions of dollars to help small businesses through a
combination of small business loans, grants and ad credits. Importantly, we've made authoritative
content a key focus area across both Google Search and YouTube to help users search for trusted
public health information.
Our Other Bets are also pursuing initiatives with similar goals. For instance, as a part of our
efforts in the Metro Phoenix area, Waymo is working toward our goal of making transportation safer
and easier for everyone while Verily is developing tools and platforms to improve health outcomes.
 Moonshots 
Many companies get comfortable doing what they have always done, making only incremental changes.
This incrementalism leads to irrelevance over time, especially in technology, where change tends to
be revolutionary, not evolutionary. People thought we were crazy when we acquired YouTube and Android
and when we launched Chrome, but those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video
and mobile devices and a safer, popular browser. We continue to look toward the future and continue
to invest for the long-term. As we said in the original founders' letter, we will not shy away from
high-risk, high-reward projects that we believe in because they are the key to our long-term success.
 The power of machine learning 
Across the company, machine learning and AI are increasingly driving many of our latest innovations.
Our investments in machine learning over the past decade have enabled us to build products that are
smarter and more helpful. For example, a huge breakthrough in natural language understanding, called
BERT, now improves results for almost every English language search query.
DeepMind made a significant AI-powered breakthrough, solving a 50-year-old protein folding challenge,
which will help us better understand one of life’s fundamental building blocks, and will enable
researchers to tackle new and difficult problems, from fighting diseases to environmental
sustainability.

 Google 
For reporting purposes, Google comprises two segments: Google Services and Google Cloud.
 Google Services 
 Serving our users 
We have always been a company committed to building helpful products that can improve the lives of
millions of people. Our product innovations have made our services widely used, and our brand one of
the most recognized in the world. Google Services' core products and platforms include Android,
Chrome, Gmail, Google Drive, Google Maps, Google Photos, Google Play, Search, and YouTube, each with
broad and growing adoption by users around the world.
Our products and services have come a long way since the company was founded more than two decades
ago. Rather than the ten blue links in our early search results, users can now get direct answers to
their questions using their computer, mobile device, or their own voice, making it quicker, easier
and more natural to find what you're looking for.
This drive to make information more accessible and helpful has led us over the years to improve the
discovery and creation of digital content, on the web and through platforms like Google Play and
YouTube. With the migration to mobile, people are consuming more digital content by watching more
videos, playing more games, listening to more music, reading more books, and using more apps than
ever before. Working with content creators and partners, we continue to build new ways for people
around the world to find great digital content.
Fueling all of these great digital experiences are powerful platforms and hardware. That’s why we
continue to invest in platforms like our Android mobile operating system, Chrome browser, Chrome
operating system, as well as growing our family of great hardware devices. We see tremendous
potential for devices to be helpful, make your life easier, and get better over time, by combining
the best of our AI, software, and hardware. This is reflected in our latest generation of hardware
products like Pixel 4a, Pixel 4a 5G and Pixel 5 phones, Chromecast with Google TV and the Google Nest
Hub smart display. Creating beautiful products that people rely on every day is a journey that we are
investing in for the long run.
Key to building helpful products for users is our commitment to privacy, security and user choice. As
the Internet evolves, we continue to invest in keeping data safe, including enhanced malware features
in Chrome and improvements to auto-delete controls that will automatically delete web and app
searches after 18 months.
 How we make money 
Our advertising products deliver relevant ads at just the right time, to give people useful
commercial information, regardless of the device they’re using. We also provide advertisers with
tools that help them better attribute and measure their advertising campaigns. Our advertising
solutions help millions of companies grow their businesses, and we offer a wide range of products
across devices and formats. Google Services generates revenues primarily by delivering both
performance advertising and brand advertising.
• Performance advertising creates and delivers relevant ads that users will click on, leading to
direct engagement with advertisers. Most of our performance advertisers pay us when a user engages in
their ads. Performance advertising lets our advertisers connect with users while driving measurable
results. Our ads tools allow performance advertisers to create simple text-based ads that appear on
Google Search & other properties, YouTube and the properties of Google Network Members. In addition,
Google Network Members use our platforms to display relevant ads on their properties, generating
revenues when site visitors view or click on the ads. We continue to invest in our advertising
programs and make significant upgrades.
• Brand advertising helps enhance users' awareness of and affinity with advertisers' products and
services, through videos, text, images, and other interactive ads that run across various devices. We
help brand advertisers deliver digital videos and other types of ads to specific audiences for their
brand-building marketing campaigns.
We have built a world-class ad technology platform for advertisers, agencies, and publishers to power
their digital marketing businesses. We aim to ensure great user experiences by serving the right ads
at the right time and by building deep partnerships with brands and agencies. We also seek to improve
the measurability of advertising so advertisers know when their campaigns are effective.
We have allocated substantial resources to stopping bad advertising practices and protecting users on
the web. We focus on creating the best advertising experiences for our users and advertisers in many
ways, ranging
 6 
 Table of ContentsAlphabet Inc. 
from filtering out invalid traffic, removing billions of bad ads from our systems every year to
closely monitoring the sites, apps, and videos where ads appear and blocklisting them when necessary
to ensure that ads do not fund bad content.
We continue to look to the future and are making long-term investments that will grow revenues beyond
advertising, including Google Play, hardware, and YouTube. We are also investing in research efforts
in AI and quantum computing to foster innovation across our businesses and create new opportunities.
 Google Cloud 
Google was a company built in the cloud. We continue to invest in infrastructure, security, data
management, analytics and AI. We see significant opportunity in helping businesses utilize these
strengths with features like data migration, modern development environments and machine learning
tools to provide enterprise-ready cloud services, including Google Cloud Platform and Google
Workspace (formerly known as G Suite). Google Cloud Platform enables developers to build, test, and
deploy applications on its highly scalable and reliable infrastructure. Our Google Workspace
collaboration tools — which include apps like Gmail, Docs, Drive, Calendar, Meet and more — are
designed with real-time collaboration and machine intelligence to help people work smarter. Because
more and more of today’s great digital experiences are being built in the cloud, our Google Cloud
products help businesses of all sizes take advantage of the latest technology advances to operate
more efficiently.
Google Cloud generates revenues primarily from fees received for Google Cloud Platform services and
Google Workspace collaboration tools.
 Other Bets 
Throughout Alphabet, we are also using technology to try and solve big problems across many
industries. Alphabet’s investment in our portfolio of Other Bets include emerging businesses at
various stages of development, ranging from those in the research and development phase to those that
are in the beginning stages of commercialization, and our goal is for them to become thriving,
successful businesses in the medium to long term. While these early-stage businesses naturally come
with considerable uncertainty, some of them are already generating revenue and making important
strides in their industries. Revenues are primarily generated from internet and TV services, as well
as licensing and R&D services.
Other Bets operate as independent companies and some of them have their own boards with independent
members and outside investors. We are investing in our portfolio of Other Bets and being very
deliberate about the focus, scale, and pace of investments.
 Competition 
Our business is characterized by rapid change as well as new and disruptive technologies. We face
formidable competition in every aspect of our business, particularly from companies that seek to
connect people with online information and provide them with relevant advertising. We face
competition from:
• General purpose search engines and information services, such as Baidu, Microsoft's Bing, Naver,
Seznam, Verizon's Yahoo, and Yandex.
• Vertical search engines and e-commerce websites, such as Amazon and eBay (e-commerce), Booking's
Kayak (travel queries), Microsoft's LinkedIn (job queries), and WebMD (health queries). Some users
will navigate directly to such content, websites, and apps rather than go through Google.
• Social networks, such as Facebook, Snapchat, and Twitter. Some users increasingly rely on social
networks for product or service referrals, rather than seeking information through traditional search
engines.
• Other forms of advertising, such as billboards, magazines, newspapers, radio, and television. Our
advertisers typically advertise in multiple media, both online and offline.
• Other online advertising platforms and networks, including Amazon, AppNexus, Criteo, and Facebook,
that compete for advertisers that use Google Ads, our primary auction-based advertising platform.
• Providers of digital video services, such as Amazon, Apple, AT&T, Disney, Facebook, Hulu, Netflix
and TikTok.
In businesses that are further afield from our advertising business, we compete with companies that
have longer operating histories and more established relationships with customers and users. We face
competition from:
• Other digital content and application platform providers, such as Amazon and Apple.
 7 
 Table of ContentsAlphabet Inc. 
• Companies that design, manufacture, and market consumer hardware products, including businesses
that have developed proprietary platforms.
• Providers of enterprise cloud services, including Alibaba, Amazon, and Microsoft.
• Digital assistant providers, such as Amazon and Apple.
Competing successfully depends heavily on our ability to deliver and distribute innovative products
and technologies to the marketplace across our businesses. Specifically, for advertising, competing
successfully depends on attracting and retaining:
• Users, for whom other products and services are literally one click away, largely on the basis of
the relevance of our advertising, as well as the general usefulness, security and availability of our
products and services.
• Advertisers, primarily based on our ability to generate sales leads, and ultimately customers, and
to deliver their advertisements in an efficient and effective manner across a variety of distribution
channels.
• Content providers, primarily based on the quality of our advertiser base, our ability to help these
partners generate revenues from advertising, and the terms of our agreements with them.
 Ongoing Commitment to Sustainability 
At Google, we build technology that helps people do more for the planet. We strive to build
sustainability into everything we do, including designing and operating efficient data centers,
advancing carbon-free energy, creating sustainable workplaces, building better devices and services,
empowering users with technology, and enabling a responsible supply chain.
Google has been carbon neutral since 2007, and in 2019, for the third consecutive year, we matched
100% of our electricity consumption with renewable energy purchases. We are the largest annual
corporate purchaser of renewable energy in the world, based on renewable electricity purchased in
megawatt-hour (MWh). In 2020, we neutralized our entire legacy carbon footprint since our founding
(covering all our operational emissions before we became carbon neutral in 2007), making Google the
first major company to achieve carbon neutrality for its entire operating history. In our third
decade of climate action, we’ve set our most ambitious goal yet: to run our business on carbon-free
energy everywhere, at all times, by 2030.
We're also investing in technologies to help our partners and people all over the world make
sustainable choices. For example, we intend to enable 5 GW of new carbon-free energy across our key
manufacturing regions by 2030 through investment. We anticipate this will spur more than $5 billion
in clean energy investments, avoid the amount of emissions equal to taking more than 1 million cars
off the road each year, and create more than 8,000 clean energy jobs. With the Environmental Insights
Explorer, we're also working to help more than 500 cities and local governments globally reduce a
total of 1 gigaton of carbon emissions annually by 2030 — that’s the equivalent of the annual carbon
emissions of a country the size of Japan.
Google’s products are already helping people make more sustainable choices in their daily lives,
whether it’s using Google Maps to find bike-shares and electric vehicle charging stations, or in many
European countries, using Google Flights to sort the least carbon-intensive option flights. There are
more tools and information we can provide, and our goal is to find new ways that our products can
help 1 billion people make more sustainable choices by 2022.
Climate change is one of the most significant global challenges of our time. In 2017, we developed a
climate resilience strategy, which included conducting a climate scenario analysis. We've earned a
spot on the CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project) Climate Change A List for seven consecutive
years. We believe our CDP climate change response reflects the recommendations of the Task Force on
Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).
In 2020, we issued $5.75 billion in sustainability bonds, the largest sustainability or green bond
issuance by any company in history. The net proceeds from the issuance are used to fund
environmentally and socially responsible projects in the following eight areas: energy efficiency,
clean energy, green buildings, clean transportation, circular economy and design, affordable housing,
commitment to racial equity, and support for small businesses and COVID-19 crisis response.
More information on our approach to sustainability can be found in our annual sustainability reports,
including Google’s environmental report. The content of our sustainability reports are not
incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any other report or document we
file with the SEC.

 Culture and Workforce 
We’re a company of curious, talented and passionate people. We embrace collaboration and creativity,
and encourage the iteration of ideas to address complex challenges in technology and society.
Our people are critical for our continued success. We work hard to provide an environment where
Googlers can have fulfilling careers, and be happy, healthy and productive. We offer industry-leading
benefits and programs to take care of the diverse needs of our employees and their families,
including access to excellent healthcare choices, opportunities for career growth and development,
and resources to support their financial health. Our competitive compensation programs help us to
attract and retain top candidates, and we will continue to invest in recruiting talented people to
technical and non-technical roles and rewarding them well.
Alphabet is committed to making diversity, equity, and inclusion part of everything we do and we’re
committed to growing a workforce that’s representative of the users we serve. More information on
Google’s approach to diversity can be found in our annual diversity reports, available publicly at
diversity.google. The content of our diversity reports is not incorporated by reference into this
Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any other report or document we file with the SEC.
We have work councils and statutory employee representation obligations in certain countries and we
are committed to supporting protected labor rights, maintaining an open culture and listening to all
Googlers. Supporting healthy and open dialogue is central to how we work, and we communicate
information about the company through multiple internal channels to our employees. As of December 31,
2020, Alphabet had 135,301 employees.
When necessary, we contract with businesses around the world to provide specialized services where we
don’t have appropriate in-house expertise or resources, often in fields that require specialized
training like cafe operations, customer support, content moderation and physical security. We also
contract with temporary staffing agencies when we need to cover short-term leaves, when we have
spikes in business needs, or when we need to quickly incubate special projects. We choose our
partners and staffing agencies carefully, and review their compliance with Google’s Supplier Code of
Conduct. We continually make improvements to promote a respectful and positive working environment
for everyone — employees, vendors and temporary staff alike.
 Government Regulation 
We are subject to numerous U.S. federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations covering a wide
variety of subject matters. Like other companies in the technology industry, we face heightened
scrutiny from both U.S. and foreign governments with respect to our compliance with laws and
regulations. Our compliance with these laws and regulations may be onerous and could, individually or
in the aggregate, increase our cost of doing business, impact our competitive position relative to
our peers, and/or otherwise have an adverse impact on our business, reputation, financial condition,
and operating results. For additional information about government regulation applicable to our
business, see Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A, Trends in Our Business in Part II, Item 7, and Legal
Matters in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 in
this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Intellectual Property 
We rely on various intellectual property laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions
to protect our proprietary technology and our brand. We have registered, and applied for the
registration of, U.S. and international trademarks, service marks, domain names and copyrights. We
have also filed patent applications in the U.S. and foreign countries covering certain of our
technology, and acquired patent assets to supplement our portfolio. We have licensed in the past, and
expect that we may license in the future, certain of our rights to other parties.
 Seasonality 
Our business is affected by seasonal fluctuations in internet usage, advertising expenditures, and
underlying business trends such as traditional retail seasonality (including developments and
volatility arising from COVID-19).

│ RISK FACTORS │
Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including but
not limited to those described below, which could harm our business, reputation, financial condition,
and operating results.
 Risks Specific to our Company 
We generate a significant portion of our revenues from advertising, and reduced spending by
advertisers, a loss of partners, or new and existing technologies that block ads online and/or affect
our ability to customize ads could harm our business.
We generate d over 80% o f total revenues from the display of ads online in 2020. Many of our
advertisers, companies that distribute our products and services, digital publishers, and content
providers can terminate their contracts with us at any time. These partners may not continue to do
business with us if we do not create more value (such as increased numbers of users or customers, new
sales leads, increased brand awareness, or more effective monetization) than their available
alternatives. Changes to our advertising policies and data privacy practices, as well as changes to
other companies’ advertising and/or data privacy practices may affect the advertising that we are
able to provide, which could harm our business. In addition, technologies have been developed that
make customized ads more difficult or that block the display of ads altogether and some providers of
online services have integrated technologies that could potentially impair the availability and
functionality of third-party digital advertising. Failing to provide superior value or deliver
advertisements effectively and competitively could harm our reputation, financial condition, and
operating results.
In addition, expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical, reflecting overall economic conditions
and budgeting and buying patterns. Adverse macroeconomic conditions, including COVID-19 and its
effects on the global economy (as discussed in greater detail in our COVID-19 risk factor under
‘General Risks’ below), have impacted the demand for advertising and resulted in fluctuations in the
amounts our advertisers spend on advertising, and could have an adverse impact on such demand and
spend, which could harm our financial condition and operating results.
We face intense competition. If we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services that
are useful to users, we may not remain competitive, which could harm our business and operating
results.
Our business environment is rapidly evolving and intensely competitive. Our businesses face changing
technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of rival products and services. To
compete successfully, we must accurately anticipate technology developments and deliver innovative,
relevant and useful products, services, and technologies in a timely manner. As our businesses
evolve, the competitive pressure to innovate will encompass a wider range of products and services.
We must continue to invest significant resources in research and development, including through
acquisitions, in order to enhance our technology and new and existing products and services.
We have many competitors in different industries. Our current and potential domestic and
international competitors range from large and established companies to emerging start-ups. Some
competitors have longer operating histories and well established relationships in various sectors.
They can use their experience and resources in ways that could affect our competitive position,
including by making acquisitions, continuing to invest heavily in research and development and in
talent, aggressively initiating intellectual property claims (whether or not meritorious), and
continuing to compete aggressively for users, advertisers, customers, and content providers. Further,
discrepancies in enforcement of existing laws may enable our lesser known competitors to aggressively
interpret those laws without commensurate scrutiny, thereby affording them competitive advantages.
Our competitors may also be able to innovate and provide products and services faster than we can or
may foresee the need for products and services before us.
Our operating results may also suffer if our products and services are not responsive to the needs of
our users, advertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers. As technologies continue to
develop, our competitors may be able to offer experiences that are, or that are seen to be,
substantially similar to or better than ours. This
 10 
 Table of ContentsAlphabet Inc. 
may force us to compete in different ways and expend significant resources in order to remain
competitive. If our competitors are more successful than we are in developing compelling products or
in attracting and retaining users, advertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers, our
operating results could be harmed.
Our ongoing investment in new businesses, products, services, and technologies is inherently risky,
and could disrupt our current operations and harm our financial condition and operating results.
We have invested and expect to continue to invest in new businesses, products, services, and
technologies. The investments that we are making across Google Services, Google Cloud and Other Bets
reflect our ongoing efforts to innovate and provide products and services that are useful to users,
advertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers. Our investments in Google Services, Google
Cloud and Other Bets span a wide range of industries beyond online advertising. Such investments
ultimately may not be commercially viable or may not result in an adequate return of capital and, in
pursuing new strategies, we may incur unanticipated liabilities. These endeavors may involve
significant risks and uncertainties, including diversion of management resources and, with respect to
Other Bets, the use of alternative investment, governance, or compensation structures that may fail
to adequately align incentives across the company or otherwise accomplish their objectives.
Within Google Services, we continue to invest heavily in hardware, including our smartphones and home
devices, which is a highly competitive market with frequent introduction of new products and
services, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, short product life cycles,
evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics,
and price and feature sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. There can be no assurance
we will be able to provide hardware that competes effectively.
Within Google Cloud, we devote significant resources to develop and deploy our enterprise-ready cloud
services, including Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace. We are incurring costs to build and
maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services and hire talent, particularly to support
and scale our salesforce. At the same time, our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying
cloud-based services. Pricing and delivery models are competitive and evolving, and we may not attain
sufficient scale and profitability to achieve our business objectives.
Within Other Bets, we are investing significantly in the areas of health, life sciences, and
transportation, among others. These investment areas face intense competition from large experienced
and well-funded competitors and our offerings may not be able to compete effectively or to operate at
sufficient levels of profitability.
In addition, new and evolving products and services, including those that use artificial intelligence
and machine learning, raise ethical, technological, legal, regulatory, and other challenges, which
may negatively affect our brands and demand for our products and services. Because all of these new
ventures are inherently risky, no assurance can be given that such strategies and offerings will be
successful and will not harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results.
Our revenue growth rate could decline over time, and we anticipate downward pressure on our operating
margin in the future.
Our revenue growth rate could decline over time as a result of a number of factors, including
increasing competition and the continued expansion of our business into a variety of new fields.
Changes in device mix, geographic mix, ongoing product and policy changes, product mix, and property
mix and an increasing competition for advertising may also affect our advertising revenue growth
rate. We may also experience a decline in our revenue growth rate as our revenues increase to higher
levels, if there is a decrease in the rate of adoption of our products, services, and technologies,
or due to deceleration or decline in demand for devices used to access our services, among other
factors. In addition, COVID-19 and its effects on the global economy has impacted and may continue to
adversely impact our revenue growth rate (as discussed in greater detail in our COVID-19 risk factor
under ‘General Risks’ below).
In addition to a decline in our revenue growth rate, we may also experience downward pressure on our
operating margin resulting from a variety of factors, such as the continued expansion of our business
into new fields, including products and services such as hardware, Google Cloud, and subscription
products, as well as significant investments in Other Bets, all of which may have margins lower than
those we generate from advertising. We may also experience downward pressure on our operating margins
from increasing regulations, increasing competition and increased costs for many aspects of our
business, including within advertising where changes such as device mix, property mix, and partner
agreements can affect margin. The margin we earn on revenues generated from our Google Network
Members could also decrease in the future if we pay a larger percentage of advertising fees to them.
We may also pay increased TAC to our distribution partners as well as increased content acquisition
 11 
 Table of ContentsAlphabet Inc. 
costs to content providers. We may also face an increase in infrastructure costs, supporting
businesses such as Search, Google Cloud, and YouTube. Many of our expenses are less variable in
nature and may not correlate to changes in revenues.
Due to these factors and the evolving nature of our business, our historical revenue growth rate and
historical operating margin may not be indicative of our future performance.
Our intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the
value of our products, services and brands as well as affect our ability to compete.
Our patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights are
important assets for us. Various events outside of our control pose a threat to our intellectual
property rights, as well as to our products, services, and technologies. For example, effective
intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and
services are distributed or made available through the Internet. Also, the efforts we have taken to
protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Although we seek to obtain patent
protection for our innovations, it is possible we may not be able to protect some of these
innovations. Moreover, we may not have adequate patent or copyright protection for certain
innovations that later turn out to be important. Furthermore, there is always the possibility,
despite our efforts, that the scope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued
patent may be deemed invalid or unenforceable.
We also seek to maintain certain intellectual property as trade secrets. The secrecy of such trade
secrets and other sensitive information could be compromised, which could cause us to lose the
competitive advantage resulting from these trade secrets. We also face risks associated with our
trademarks. For example, there is a risk that the word “Google” could become so commonly used that it
becomes synonymous with the word “search.” Some courts have ruled that "Google" is a protectable
trademark, but it is possible that other courts, particularly those outside of the United States, may
reach a different determination. If this happens, we could lose protection for this trademark, which
could result in other people using the word “Google” to refer to their own products, thus diminishing
our brand.
Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our
ability to compete. Also, protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming.
Any increase in the unauthorized use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do
business and harm our operating results.
Our business depends on strong brands, and failing to maintain and enhance our brands would hurt our
ability to expand our base of users, advertisers, customers, content providers, and other partners.
Our strong brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business. Maintaining and
enhancing the brands within Google Services, Google Cloud and Other Bets increases our ability to
enter new categories and launch new and innovative products that better serve the needs of our users,
advertisers, customers, content providers, and other partners. Our brands may be negatively affected
by a number of factors, including, among others, reputational issues, third-party content shared on
our platforms, data privacy and security issues and developments, and product or technical
performance failures. For example, if we fail to appropriately respond to the sharing of
misinformation or objectionable content on our services and/or products or objectionable practices by
advertisers, or to otherwise adequately address user concerns, our users may lose confidence in our
brands.
Furthermore, failure to maintain and enhance equity in our brands may harm our business, financial
condition, and operating results. Our success will depend largely on our ability to remain a
technology leader and continue to provide high-quality, innovative products and services that are
truly useful and play a valuable role in a range of settings.
We face a number of manufacturing and supply chain risks that, if not properly managed, could harm
our financial condition, operating results, and prospects.
We face a number of risks related to manufacturing and supply chain management, which could affect
our ability to supply both our products and our internet-based services.
We rely on other companies to manufacture many of our finished products, to design certain of our
components and parts, and to participate in the distribution of our products and services. Our
business could be negatively affected if we are not able to engage these companies with the necessary
capabilities or capacity on reasonable terms, or if those we engage fail to meet their obligations
(whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons), or make adverse changes in the pricing or
other material terms of our arrangements with them.
We have experienced and/or may experience supply shortages and price increases driven by raw
material, component or part availability, manufacturing capacity, labor shortages, industry
allocations, tariffs, trade disputes
 12

and barriers, natural disasters or pandemics (including COVID-19), the effects of climate change
(such as sea level rise, drought, flooding, wildfires, and increased storm severity), and significant
changes in the financial or business condition of our suppliers. We have experienced and/or may in
the future, experience shortages or other supply chain disruptions that could negatively affect our
operations. In addition, some of the components we use in our technical infrastructure and products
are available from only one or limited sources, and we may not be able to find replacement vendors on
favorable terms in the event of a supply chain disruption. In addition, a significant supply
interruption could delay critical data center upgrades or expansions and delay product availability.
We may enter into long term contracts for materials and products that commit us to significant terms
and conditions. We may be liable for materials and products that are not consumed due to market
acceptance, technological change, obsolescences, quality, product recalls, and warranty issues. For
instance, because certain of our hardware supply contracts have volume-based pricing or minimum
purchase requirements, if the volume of our hardware sales decreases or does not reach projected
targets, we could face increased materials and manufacturing costs or other financial liabilities
that could make our products more costly per unit to manufacture and negatively affect our financial
results. Furthermore, certain of our competitors may negotiate more favorable contractual terms based
on volume and other commitments that may provide them with competitive advantages and may affect our
supply.
Our products and services may have quality issues resulting from design, manufacturing, or
operations. Sometimes, these issues may be caused by components we purchase from other manufacturers
or suppliers. If the quality of our products and services does not meet expectations or our products
or services are defective, it could harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results.
We require our suppliers and business partners to comply with laws and, where applicable, our company
policies, such as the Google Supplier Code of Conduct, regarding workplace and employment practices,
data security, environmental compliance and intellectual property licensing, but we do not control
them or their practices. Violations of law or unethical business practices could result in supply
chain disruptions, canceled orders, harm to key relationships, and damage to our reputation. Their
failure to procure necessary license rights to intellectual property, could affect our ability to
sell our products or services and expose us to litigation or financial claims.
Interruption, interference with, or failure of our complex information technology and communications
systems could hurt our ability to effectively provide our products and services, which could harm our
reputation, financial condition, and operating results. In addition, complications with the design or
implementation of our new global enterprise resource planning system could harm our business and
operations.
The availability of our products and services and fulfillment of our customer contracts depend on the
continuing operation of our information technology and communications systems. Our systems are
vulnerable to damage, interference, or interruption from modifications or upgrades, terrorist
attacks, natural disasters or pandemics (including COVID-19), the effects of climate change (such as
sea level rise, drought, flooding, wildfires, and increased storm severity), power loss,
telecommunications failures, computer viruses, ransomware attacks, computer denial of service
attacks, phishing schemes, or other attempts to harm or access our systems. Some of our data centers
are located in areas with a high risk of major earthquakes or other natural disasters. Our data
centers are also subject to break-ins, sabotage, and intentional acts of vandalism, and, in some
cases, to potential disruptions resulting from problems experienced by facility operators. Some of
our systems are not fully redundant, and disaster recovery planning cannot account for all
eventualities.
The occurrence of a natural disaster or pandemic (including COVID-19), closure of a facility, or
other unanticipated problems at, or impacting, our data centers could result in lengthy interruptions
in our service. In addition, our products and services are highly technical and complex and may
contain errors or vulnerabilities, which could result in interruptions in or failure of our services
or systems.
In addition, we rely extensively on information systems and technology to manage our business and
summarize operating results. We are in the process of a multi-year implementation of a new ERP
system, which will replace much of our existing core financial systems. The ERP system is designed to
accurately maintain our financial records, enhance the flow of financial information, improve data
management, and provide timely information to our management team. We may not be able to successfully
implement the ERP system without experiencing delays, increased costs, and other difficulties.
Failure to successfully design and implement the new ERP system as planned could harm our business,
financial condition, and operating results. Additionally, if we do not effectively implement the ERP
system as planned or the ERP system does not operate as intended, the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting could be negatively affected.
 13 
 Table of ContentsAlphabet Inc. 
Our international operations expose us to additional risks that could harm our business, our
financial condition, and operating results.
Our international operations are significant to our revenues and net income, and we plan to continue
to grow internationally. International revenues accounted for approximately 53% of our consolidated
revenues in 2020. In addition to risks described elsewhere in this section, our international
operations expose us to other risks, including the following:
• Restrictions on foreign ownership and investments, and stringent foreign exchange controls that
might prevent us from repatriating cash earned in countries outside the U.S.
• Import and export requirements, tariffs and other market access barriers that may prevent or impede
us from offering products or providing services to a particular market, or that could limit our
ability to source assemblies and finished products from a particular market, and may increase our
operating costs.
• Longer payment cycles in some countries, increased credit risk, and higher levels of payment fraud.
• Evolving foreign events, including the effect of the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European
Union, may adversely affect our revenues and could subject us to new regulatory costs and challenges
(including the transfer of personal data between the EU and the United Kingdom and new customer
requirements), in addition to other adverse effects that we are unable to effectively anticipate.
• Anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and other local laws
prohibiting certain payments to government officials, violations of which could result in civil and
criminal penalties.
• Uncertainty regarding liability for services and content, including uncertainty as a result of
local laws and lack of legal precedent.
• Different employee/employer relationships, existence of works councils and labor unions, and other
challenges caused by distance, language, and cultural differences, making it harder to do business in
certain jurisdictions.
Because we conduct business in currencies other than U.S. dollars but report our financial results in
U.S. dollars, we face exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Although we hedge
a portion of our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations in exchange rates between
the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our revenues and earnings, particularly
in light of market volatilities due to COVID-19. Hedging programs are also inherently risky and could
expose us to additional risks that could harm our financial condition and operating results.
 Risks Related to our Industry 
People access the Internet through a variety of platforms and devices that continue to evolve with
the advancement of technology and user preferences. If manufacturers and users do not widely adopt
versions of our products and services developed for these interfaces, our business could be harmed.
People access the Internet through a growing variety of devices such as desktop computers, mobile
phones, smartphones, laptops and tablets, video game consoles, voice-activated speakers, wearables,
automobiles, and television-streaming devices. Our products and services may be less popular on some
interfaces. Each manufacturer or distributor may establish unique technical standards for its
devices, and our products and services may not be available or may only be available with limited
functionality for our users or our advertisers on these devices as a result. Some manufacturers may
also elect not to include our products on their devices. In addition, search queries are increasingly
being undertaken via voice-activated speakers, apps, social media or other platforms, which could
harm our business. It is hard to predict the challenges we may encounter in adapting our products and
services and developing competitive new products and services. We expect to continue to devote
significant resources to creating and supporting products and services across multiple platforms and
devices. Failing to attract and retain a substantial number of new device manufacturers, suppliers,
distributors, developers, and users, or failing to develop products and technologies that work well
on new devices and platforms, could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results and
ability to capture future business opportunities.
Data privacy and security concerns relating to our technology and our practices could damage our
reputation, cause us to incur significant liability, and deter current and potential users or
customers from using our products and services. Software bugs or defects, security breaches, and
attacks on our systems could result in the improper disclosure and use of user data and interference
with our users and customers’ ability to use our products and services, harming our business
operations and reputation.
 14 
 Table of ContentsAlphabet Inc. 
Concerns about our practices with regard to the collection, use, disclosure, or security of personal
information or other data-privacy-related matters, even if unfounded, could harm our reputation,
financial condition, and operating results. Our policies and practices may change over time as
expectations regarding privacy and data change.
Our products and services involve the storage and transmission of proprietary and other sensitive
information, and bugs, theft, misuse, defects, vulnerabilities in our products and services, and
security breaches expose us to a risk of loss of this information, improper use and disclosure of
such information, litigation, and other potential liability. Systems and control failures, security
breaches, failure to comply with our privacy policies, and/or inadvertent disclosure of user data
could result in government and legal exposure, seriously harm our reputation and brand and,
therefore, our business, and impair our ability to attract and retain users or customers. We expect
to continue to expend significant resources to maintain security protections that shield against
bugs, theft, misuse, or security vulnerabilities or breaches.
We experience cyber attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to our systems on a
regular basis. We may experience future security issues, whether due to employee error or malfeasance
or system errors or vulnerabilities in our or other parties’ systems, which could result in
significant legal and financial exposure. Government inquiries and enforcement actions, litigation,
and adverse press coverage could harm our business. We may be unable to anticipate or detect attacks
or vulnerabilities or implement adequate preventative measures. Attacks and security issues could
also compromise trade secrets and other sensitive information, harming our business.
While we have dedicated significant resources to privacy and security incident response capabilities,
including dedicated worldwide incident response teams, our response process, particularly during
times of a natural disaster or pandemic (including COVID-19), may not be adequate, may fail to
accurately assess the severity of an incident, may not respond quickly enough, or may fail to
sufficiently remediate an incident. As a result, we may suffer significant legal, reputational, or
financial exposure, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.
Our ongoing investments in safety, security, and content review will likely continue to identify
abuse of our platforms and misuse of user data.
In addition to our efforts to mitigate cyber attacks, we are making significant investments in
safety, security, and content review efforts to combat misuse of our services and unauthorized access
to user data by third parties, including investigations and review of platform applications that
could access the information of users of our services. As a result of these efforts, we could
discover incidents of unnecessary access to or misuse of user data or other undesirable activity by
third parties. We may not discover all such incidents or activity, whether as a result of our data
limitations, including our lack of visibility over our encrypted services, the scale of activity on
our platform, or other factors, including factors outside of our control such as a natural disaster
or pandemic (including COVID-19), and we may be notified of such incidents or activity via third
parties. Such incidents and activities may include the use of user data or our systems in a manner
inconsistent with our terms, contracts or policies, the existence of false or undesirable user
accounts, election interference, improper ad purchases, activities that threaten people’s safety on-
or offline, or instances of spamming, scraping, or spreading disinformation. We may also be
unsuccessful in our efforts to enforce our policies or otherwise remediate any such incidents. Any of
the foregoing developments may negatively affect user trust and engagement, harm our reputation and
brands, require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business, and
adversely affect our business and financial results. Any such developments may also subject us to
additional litigation and regulatory inquiries, which could result in monetary penalties and damages,
divert management’s time and attention, and lead to enhanced regulatory oversight.
Problematic content on our platforms, including low-quality user-generated content, web spam, content
farms, and other violations of our guidelines could affect the quality of our services, which could
damage our reputation and deter our current and potential users from using our products and services.
We, like others in the industry, face violations of our content guidelines across our platforms,
including sophisticated attempts by bad actors to manipulate our hosting and advertising systems to
fraudulently generate revenues, or to otherwise generate traffic that does not represent genuine user
interest or intent. While we invest significantly in efforts to promote high-quality and relevant
results and to detect and prevent low-quality content and invalid traffic, we may be unable to
adequately detect and prevent such abuses or promote high-quality content, particularly during times
of a natural disaster or pandemic (including COVID-19).
Many websites violate or attempt to violate our guidelines, including by seeking to inappropriately
rank higher in search results than our search engine's assessment of their relevance and utility
would rank them. Such efforts
 15 
 Table of ContentsAlphabet Inc. 
(known as “web spam”) may affect the quality of content on our platforms and lead them to display
false, misleading or undesirable content.
Although English-language web spam in our search results has been reduced, and web spam in most other
languages is limited, we expect web spammers will continue to seek inappropriate ways to improve
their rankings. We continuously combat web spam in our search results, including through indexing
technology that makes it harder for spam-like, less useful web content to rank highly. We also
continue to invest in and deploy proprietary technology to detect and prevent web spam from abusing
our platforms.
We also face other challenges from low-quality and irrelevant content websites, including content
farms, which are websites that generate large quantities of low-quality content to help them improve
their search rankings. We are continually launching algorithmic changes focused on detecting and
preventing abuse from low-quality websites.
We also face other challenges on our platforms, including violations of our content guidelines
involving incidents such as attempted election interference, activities that threaten the safety
and/or well-being of our users on- or offline, and the spreading of disinformation, among other
challenges.
If we fail to either detect and prevent an increase in problematic content or effectively promote
high-quality content, it could hurt our reputation for delivering relevant information or reduce use
of our platforms, harming our financial condition or operating results. It may also subject us to
litigation and regulatory inquiries, which could result in monetary penalties and damages, divert
management’s time and attention, and lead to enhanced regulatory oversight.
Our business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the Internet by us and our users. Internet
access providers may be able to restrict, block, degrade, or charge for access to certain of our
products and services, which could lead to additional expenses and the loss of users and advertisers.
Our products and services depend on the ability of our users to access the Internet, and certain of
our products require significant bandwidth to work effectively. Currently, this access is provided by
companies that have significant market power in the broadband and internet access marketplace,
including incumbent telephone companies, cable companies, mobile communications companies, and
government-owned service providers. Some of these providers have taken, or have stated that they may
take measures that could degrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of user access to certain of our
products by restricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to support or facilitate our
offerings, by charging increased fees to us or our users to provide our offerings, or by providing
our competitors preferential access. Some jurisdictions have adopted regulations prohibiting certain
forms of discrimination by internet access providers; however, substantial uncertainty exists in the
United States and elsewhere regarding such protections. For example, in 2018 the United States
Federal Communications Commission repealed net neutrality rules, which could permit internet access
providers to restrict, block, degrade, or charge for access to certain of our products and services.
In addition, in some jurisdictions, our products and services have been subject to government-
initiated restrictions or blockages. COVID-19 has also resulted in quarantines, shelter in place
orders, and work from home directives, all of which have increased demands for internet access and
may create access challenges. These could result in a loss of existing users, customers and
advertisers, goodwill, and increased costs, and could impair our ability to attract new users,
customers and advertisers, thereby harming our business.
 Risks Related to Laws and Regulations 
We face increased regulatory scrutiny as well as changes in regulatory conditions, laws and policies
governing a wide range of topics that may negatively affect our business.
We and other companies in the technology industry face increased regulatory scrutiny, enforcement
action, and other proceedings. For instance, the U.S. Department of Justice, joined by a number of
state Attorneys General, filed an antitrust complaint against Google on October 20, 2020, alleging
that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws relating to Search and Search advertising. Separately, on
December 16, 2020, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint against Google in
the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, alleging that Google violated
U.S. antitrust laws as well as state deceptive trade laws relating to its advertising technology.
Various other regulatory agencies in the United States and around the world, including competition
enforcers, consumer protection agencies, data protection authorities, grand juries, inter-agency
consultative groups, and a range of other governmental bodies have and continue to review our
products and services and their compliance with laws and regulations around the world. We continue to
cooperate with these investigations. Various laws, regulations, investigations, enforcement lawsuits,
and regulatory actions have in the past and may in the future result in substantial fines and
penalties, injunctive relief, ongoing auditing and monitoring
 16 
 Table of ContentsAlphabet Inc. 
obligations, changes to our products and services, alterations to our business models and operations,
and collateral litigation, all of which could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and
operating results.
Changes in international and local social, political, economic, tax, and regulatory conditions or in
laws and policies governing a wide range of topics may increase our cost of doing business, limit our
ability to pursue certain business models, offer products or services in certain jurisdictions, or
cause us to change our business practices. We have in the past had to alter or withdraw certain
products and services as a result of laws or regulations that made them unfeasible, and new laws or
regulations, such as the News Media Bargaining Code drafted by the Australian Competition and
Consumer Commission currently tabled in parliament, could result in our having to alter or withdraw
products and services in the future. These additional costs of doing business, new limitations or
changes to our business model or practices could harm our business, reputation, financial condition,
and operating results.
A variety of new and existing laws and/or interpretations could harm our business.
We are subject to numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subject
matters. New laws and regulations (or new interpretations or applications of existing laws and
regulations in a manner inconsistent with our practices) may make our products and services less
useful, limit our ability to pursue certain business models or offer certain products and services,
require us to incur substantial costs, expose us to civil or criminal liability, or cause us to
change our business practices. These laws and regulations are evolving and involve matters central to
our business, including, among others:
• New competition laws and related regulations around the world, that can limit certain business
practices, and in some cases, create the risk of significant penalties.
• Privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 that came into effect in January
of 2020 and the California Privacy Rights Act which will go into effect in 2023, both of which give
new data privacy rights to California residents, and SB-327 in California, which regulates the
security of data in connection with internet connected devices.
• Data protection laws passed by many states within the U.S. and by certain countries regarding
notification to data subjects and/or regulators when there is a security breach of personal data.
• New laws further restricting the collection, processing and/or sharing of advertising-related data.
• Copyright or similar laws around the world, including the EU Directive on Copyright in the Digital
Single Market (EUCD) of April 17, 2019, which EU Member States must implement by June 7, 2021; and
the News Media Bargaining Code drafted by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. These
and similar laws that have been adopted or proposed introduce new constraining licensing regimes that
could affect our ability to operate. The EUCD and similar laws could increase the liability of some
content-sharing services with respect to content uploaded by their users. Some of these laws, as well
as follow-on administrative or judicial actions, have also created or may create a new property right
in news publications that limits the ability of some online services to interact with or present such
content. They may also impose compensation negotiations with news agencies and publishers for the use
of such content, which may result in payment obligations that significantly exceed the value that
such content provides to Google and its users.
• Data localization laws, which generally mandate that certain types of data collected in a
particular country be stored and/or processed within that country.
• Various U.S. and international laws that govern the distribution of certain materials to children
and regulate the ability of online services to collect information from minors.
• Various laws with regard to content removal and disclosure obligations, such as the Network
Enforcement Act in Germany, which may affect our businesses and operations and may subject us to
significant fines if such laws are interpreted and applied in a manner inconsistent with our
practices or when we may not proactively discover such content due to the scale of third-party
content and the limitations of existing technologies. Other countries, including Singapore,
Australia, and the United Kingdom, have implemented or are considering similar legislation imposing
penalties for failure to remove certain types of content.
• Various legislative, litigation, and regulatory activity regarding our Google Play billing policies
and business model, which could result in monetary penalties, damages and/or prohibition.
In addition, the applicability and scope of these laws, as interpreted by the courts, remain
uncertain and could harm our business. For example:
 17 
 Table of ContentsAlphabet Inc. 
• We rely on statutory safe harbors, as set forth in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and Section
230 of the Communications Decency Act in the United States and the E-Commerce Directive in Europe,
against liability for various linking, caching, and hosting activities. Any legislation or court
rulings affecting these safe harbors may adversely affect us. There are legislative proposals in both
the US and EU that could reduce our safe harbor protection.
• Court decisions such as the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) on May
13, 2014 on the ‘right to be forgotten,’ which allows individuals to demand that Google remove search
results about them in certain instances, may limit the content we can show to our users and impose
significant operational burdens.
The introduction of new businesses, products, services, and technologies, our activities in certain
jurisdictions, or other actions we take may subject us to additional laws and regulations. Our
investment in a variety of new fields, such as healthcare and payment services, may expand the scope
of regulations that apply to our business. The costs of compliance with these laws and regulations
are high and are likely to increase in the future. Any failure on our part to comply with laws and
regulations can result in negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort and may
subject us to significant liabilities and other penalties.
We are subject to claims, suits, government investigations, and other proceedings that may harm our
business, financial condition, and operating results.
We are subject to claims, suits, and government investigations involving competition, intellectual
property, data privacy and security, consumer protection, tax, labor and employment, commercial
disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers
using our platforms, and other matters. Due to our manufacturing and sale of an expanded suite of
products, including hardware as well as Google Cloud offerings, we also are subject to a variety of
claims including product warranty, product liability, and consumer protection claims related to
product defects, among other litigation. We may also be subject to claims involving health and
safety, hazardous materials usage, other environmental impacts, or service disruptions or failures.
Any of these types of legal proceedings can have an adverse effect on us because of legal costs,
diversion of management resources, negative publicity and other factors. Determining reserves for our
pending litigation is a complex, fact-intensive process that requires significant judgment. The
resolution of one or more such proceedings has resulted in, and may in the future result in,
additional substantial fines, penalties, injunctions, and other sanctions that could harm our
business, financial condition, and operating results.
We may be subject to legal liability associated with providing online services or content.
Our products and services let users exchange information, advertise products and services, conduct
business, and engage in various online activities. We also place advertisements displayed on other
companies’ websites, and we offer third-party products, services, and/or content. The law relating to
the liability of online service providers for others’ activities on their services is still somewhat
unsettled around the world. Claims have been brought against us for defamation, negligence, breaches
of contract, copyright and trademark infringement, unfair competition, unlawful activity, torts,
fraud, or other legal theories based on the nature and content of information available on or via our
services.
We may be subject to claims by virtue of our involvement in hosting, transmitting, marketing,
branding, or providing access to content created by third parties. Defense of any such actions could
be costly and involve significant time and attention of our management and other resources, may
result in monetary liabilities or penalties, and may require us to change our business in an adverse
manner.
Privacy and data protection regulations are complex and rapidly evolving areas. Adverse
interpretations of these laws could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating
results.
Authorities around the world have adopted and are considering a number of legislative and regulatory
proposals concerning data protection and limits on encryption of user data. Adverse legal rulings,
legislation, or regulation could result in fines and orders requiring that we change our data
practices, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to provide services, harming our
business operations. Complying with these evolving laws could result in substantial costs and harm
the quality of our products and services, negatively affecting our business, and may be particularly
challenging during certain times, such as a natural disaster or pandemic (including COVID-19).
Recent legal developments in Europe have created compliance uncertainty regarding transfers of
personal data from Europe to the United States. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation
(GDPR) applies to all of our activities conducted from an establishment in the EU or related to
products and services that we offer to EU
 18 
 Table of ContentsAlphabet Inc. 
users or customers, or the monitoring of their behavior in the EU. The GDPR creates a range of new
compliance obligations.
Ensuring compliance with the GDPR is an ongoing commitment that involves substantial costs, and
despite our efforts, governmental authorities or others have asserted and may continue to assert that
our business practices fail to comply with its requirements. If our operations are found to violate
GDPR requirements, we may incur substantial fines, have to change our business practices, and face
reputational harm, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business. In particular, serious
breaches of the GDPR can result in administrative fines of up to 4% of annual worldwide revenues.
Fines of up to 2% of annual worldwide revenues can be levied for other specified violations.
The EU-U.S. and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield frameworks allow U.S. companies that self-certify to
the U.S. Department of Commerce and publicly commit to comply with specified requirements to import
personal data from the EU and Switzerland. Recently, the CJEU ruled that the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield
is an invalid transfer mechanism, but upheld Standard Contractual Clauses as a valid transfer
mechanism, provided they meet certain requirements. The validity of data transfer mechanisms remains
subject to legal, regulatory, and political developments in both Europe and the U.S., such as recent
recommendations from the European Data Protection Board, the invalidation of the EU-U.S. Privacy
Shield and potential invalidation of other data transfer mechanisms, which could have a significant
adverse impact on our ability to process and transfer personal data outside of the EEA.
These developments create some uncertainty, and compliance obligations could cause us to incur costs
or harm the operations of our products and services in ways that harm our business.
We face, and may continue to face intellectual property and other claims that could be costly to
defend, result in significant damage awards or other costs (including indemnification awards), and
limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future.
We, like other internet, technology and media companies, are frequently subject to litigation based
on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. In addition,
patent-holding companies may frequently seek to generate income from patents they have obtained by
bringing claims against us. As we have grown, the number of intellectual property claims against us
has increased and may continue to increase as we develop new products, services, and technologies.
We have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us
claiming that certain of our products, services, and technologies infringe the intellectual property
rights of others. Other parties have also sought broad injunctive relief against us by filing claims
in U.S. and international courts and the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) for exclusion and
cease-and-desist orders, which could limit our ability to sell our products or services in the U.S.
or elsewhere if our products or services or those of our customers or suppliers are found to infringe
the intellectual property subject to the claims. Adverse results in any of these lawsuits may include
awards of monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements (if licenses are available at
all), or orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services.
They may also cause us to change our business practices and require development of non-infringing
products, services, or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenues for us and otherwise
harm our business.
Many of our agreements with our customers and partners, including certain suppliers, require us to
defend against certain intellectual property infringement claims and in some cases indemnify them for
certain intellectual property infringement claims against them, which could result in increased costs
for defending such claims or significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims.
Such customers and partners may also discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies,
as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect
our business. Moreover, intellectual property indemnities provided to us by our suppliers, when
obtainable, may not cover all damages and losses suffered by us and our customers arising from
intellectual property infringement claims. Furthermore, in connection with our divestitures, we have
agreed, and may in the future agree, to provide indemnification for certain potential liabilities,
including those associated with intellectual property claims.
Regardless of their merits, intellectual property claims are often time consuming and expensive to
litigate or settle. To the extent such claims are successful, they may harm our business, including
our product and service offerings, financial condition, or operating results.
 Risks Related to Ownership of our Stock 
We cannot guarantee that any share repurchase program will be fully consummated or will enhance long-
term stockholder value, and share repurchases could increase the volatility of our stock prices and
could diminish our cash reserves .
 19 
 Table of ContentsAlphabet Inc. 
We engage in share repurchases of our Class C capital stock from time to time in accordance with
authorizations from the Board of Directors of Alphabet. Our repurchase program does not have an
expiration date and does not obligate Alphabet to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire
any specific number of shares. Further, our share repurchases could affect our share trading prices,
increase their volatility, reduce our cash reserves and may be suspended or terminated at any time,
which may result in a decrease in the trading prices of our stock.
The concentration of our stock ownership limits our stockholders’ ability to influence corporate
matters.
Our Class B common stock has 10 votes per share, our Class A common stock has one vote per share, and
our Class C capital stock has no voting rights. As of December 31, 2020, Larry Page and Sergey Brin
beneficially owned approximate ly 85.3% of our outstanding Class B common stock, which represented
approximate ly 51.5% o f the voting power of our outstanding common stock. Through their stock
ownership, Larry and Sergey have significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder
approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a
merger or other sale of our company or our assets, for the foreseeable future. In addition, because
our Class C capital stock carries no voting rights (except as required by applicable law), the
issuance of the Class C capital stock, including in future stock-based acquisition transactions and
to fund employee equity incentive programs, could continue Larry and Sergey’s current relative voting
power and their ability to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most matters
submitted to a vote of our stockholders. This concentrated control limits or severely restricts other
stockholders’ ability to influence corporate matters and we may take actions that some of our
stockholders do not view as beneficial, which could reduce the market price of our Class A common
stock and our Class C capital stock.
Provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that
stockholders may consider favorable.
Provisions in Alphabet’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or
preventing a change of control or changes in our management. These provisions include the following:
• Our certificate of incorporation provides for a tri-class capital stock structure. As a result of
this structure, Larry and Sergey have significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder
approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a
merger or other sale of our company or our assets. This concentrated control could discourage others
from initiating any potential merger, takeover, or other change of control transaction that other
stockholders may view as beneficial. As noted above, the issuance of the Class C capital stock could
have the effect of continuing the influence of Larry and Sergey.
• Our Board of Directors has the right to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion
of the Board of Directors or the resignation, death, or removal of a director, which prevents
stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our Board of Directors.
• Our stockholders may not act by written consent. As a result, a holder, or holders, controlling a
majority of our capital stock would not be able to take certain actions without holding a
stockholders' meeting.
• Our certificate of incorporation prohibits cumulative voting in the election of directors. This
limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates.
• Stockholders must provide advance notice to nominate individuals for election to the Board of
Directors or to propose matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders’ meeting. These provisions
may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the
acquirer's own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company.
• Our Board of Directors may issue, without stockholder approval, shares of undesignated preferred
stock. The ability to issue undesignated preferred stock makes it possible for our Board of Directors
to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of
any attempt to acquire us.
As a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to certain Delaware anti-takeover provisions. Under
Delaware law, a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more
of its outstanding voting stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other
things, the Board of Directors has approved the transaction. Our Board of Directors could rely on
Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us.

 General Risks 
The continuing impacts of COVID-19 are highly unpredictable and could be significant, and may have an
adverse effect on our business, operations and our future financial performance.
Since COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization, governments and
municipalities around the world have instituted measures in an effort to control the spread of
COVID-19, including quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, school closings, travel restrictions, and
closure of non-essential businesses. The macroeconomic impacts on our business continue to evolve and
be unpredictable and may continue to adversely affect our business, operations and financial
performance. As a result of the scale of the ongoing pandemic and the speed at which the global
community has been impacted, our revenue growth rate and expense as a percentage of our revenues in
future periods may differ significantly from our historical rate, and our future operating results
may fall below expectations.
The future impacts of the ongoing pandemic on our business, operations and future financial
performance could include, but are not limited to:
• Significant decline in advertising revenues as advertiser spending slows due to an economic
downturn. This decline in advertising revenues could persist through and beyond a recessionary
period. In addition, we may experience a significant and prolonged shift in user behavior such as a
shift in interests to less commercial topics.
• Significant decline in other revenues due to a decline or shifts in customer demand. For example,
if consumer demand for electronics significantly declines, our hardware revenues could be
significantly impacted.
• Adverse impacts to our operating income, operating margin, net income, EPS and respective growth
rates - particularly if expenses do not decrease across Alphabet at the same pace as revenue
declines. Many of our expenses are less variable in nature and/or may not correlate to changes in
revenues, including costs associated with our data centers and facilities as well as employee
compensation. As such, we may not be able to decrease them significantly in the short-term, or we may
choose not to significantly reduce them in an effort to remain focused on long-term outlook and
investment opportunities.
• Significant decline in our operating cash flows as a result of decreased advertiser spending and
deterioration in the credit quality and liquidity of our customers, which could adversely affect our
accounts receivable. Investing cash flows could decrease due to slowing spend on data center and
facilities construction projects due to a slowing or stopping of construction or significant
restrictions placed on construction.
• The prolonged and broad-based shift to a remote working environment continues to create inherent
productivity, connectivity, and oversight challenges and could affect our ability to enhance, develop
and support existing products and services, detect and prevent spam and problematic content, hold
product sales and marketing events, and generate new sales leads, among others. In addition, the
changed environment under which we are operating could have an effect on our internal controls over
financial reporting as well as our ability to meet a number of our compliance requirements in a
timely or quality manner. Additional and/or extended, governmental lockdowns, restrictions or new
regulations could significantly impact the ability of our employees and vendors to work productively.
Governmental restrictions have been globally inconsistent and it remains unclear when a return to
worksite locations or travel will be permitted or what restrictions will be in place in those
environments. As we prepare to return our workforce in more locations back to the office in 2021, we
may experience increased costs as we prepare our facilities for a safe return to work environment and
experiment with hybrid work models, in addition to potential effects on our ability to compete
effectively and maintain our corporate culture.
Our operating results may fluctuate, which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our
results to fall short of expectations.
Our operating results may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, many outside of our control.
As a result, comparing our operating results (including our expenses as a percentage of our revenues)
on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful, and you should not rely on our past results as an
indication of our future performance. Our operating results in future quarters may fall below
expectations. Any of these events could cause our stock price to fall. Each of the risk factors
listed under this Item 1A in addition to the following factors may affect our operating results:
• Our ability to attract user and/or customer adoption of, and generate significant revenues from,
new products, services, and technologies in which we have invested considerable time and resources.
 21 
 Table of ContentsAlphabet Inc. 
• Our ability to monetize traffic on Google Search & other properties, YouTube and our Google Network
Members' properties across various devices.
• The amount and timing of operating costs and expenses and capital expenditures related to the
maintenance and expansion of our businesses, operations, and infrastructure.
• Our focus on long-term goals over short-term results.
• The results of our acquisitions, divestitures, and our investments in risky projects, including new
businesses, products, services, and technologies.
• Our ability to keep our products and services operational at a reasonable cost and without service
interruptions.
• The seasonal fluctuations in internet usage, advertising spending, and underlying business trends
such as traditional retail seasonality. Our rapid growth has tended to mask the cyclicality and
seasonality of our business. As our growth rate has slowed, the cyclicality and seasonality in our
business has become more pronounced and caused our operating results to fluctuate.
• Geopolitical events, including trade disputes.
• Changes in global business or macroeconomic conditions.
Acquisitions, joint ventures, investments, and divestitures could result in operating difficulties,
dilution, and other consequences that may harm our business, financial condition, and operating
results.
Acquisitions, joint ventures, investments and divestitures are important elements of our overall
corporate strategy and use of capital, and these transactions could be material to our financial
condition and operating results. We expect to continue to evaluate and enter into discussions
regarding a wide array of such potential strategic transactions, which could create unforeseen
operating difficulties and expenditures. Some of the areas where we face risks include:
• Diversion of management time and focus from operating our business to challenges related to
acquisitions and other strategic transactions.
• Failure to successfully integrate and further develop the acquired business or technology.
• Implementation or remediation of controls, procedures, and policies at the acquired company.
• Integration of the acquired company’s accounting, human resource, and other administrative systems,
and coordination of product, engineering, and sales and marketing functions.
• Transition of operations, users, and customers onto our existing platforms.
• Failure to obtain required approvals on a timely basis, if at all, from governmental authorities,
or conditions placed upon approval that could, among other things, delay or prevent us from
completing a transaction, or otherwise restrict our ability to realize the expected financial or
strategic goals of a transaction.
• In the case of foreign acquisitions, the need to integrate operations across different cultures and
languages and to address the particular economic, currency, political, and regulatory risks
associated with specific countries.
• Cultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into our
organization, and retention of employees from the businesses we acquire.
• Liability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including patent and
trademark infringement claims, data privacy and security issues, violations of laws, commercial
disputes, tax liabilities, and other known and unknown liabilities.
• Litigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims from
terminated employees, customers, former stockholders, or other third parties.
Our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or
future acquisitions and other strategic transactions could cause us to fail to realize their
anticipated benefits, incur unanticipated liabilities, and harm our business generally.
Our acquisitions and other strategic transactions could also result in dilutive issuances of our
equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, or amortization expenses, or
impairment of goodwill and/or purchased long-lived assets, and restructuring charges, any of which
could harm our financial condition or operating results.
 22 
 Table of ContentsAlphabet Inc. 
Also, the anticipated benefits or value of our acquisitions and other strategic transactions may not
materialize. In connection with our divestitures, we have agreed, and may in the future agree, to
provide indemnification for certain potential liabilities, which may harm our financial condition or
operating results.
If we were to lose the services of key personnel, we may not be able to execute our business
strategy.
Our future success depends in large part upon the continued service of key members of our senior
management team. For instance, Sundar Pichai is critical to the overall management of Alphabet and
its subsidiaries and plays an important role in the development of our technology, maintaining our
culture and setting our strategic direction. All of our executive officers and key employees are at-
will employees, and we do not maintain any key-person life insurance policies. The loss of key
personnel could seriously harm our business.
We rely on highly skilled personnel and, if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel, hire
qualified personnel, or maintain our corporate culture, we may not be able to grow effectively.
Our performance largely depends on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals. Our ability
to compete effectively and our future success depends on our continuing to identify, hire, develop,
motivate, and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. Competition in our
industry for qualified employees is intense, and certain of our competitors have directly targeted
our employees. In addition, our compensation arrangements, such as our equity award programs, may not
always be successful in attracting new employees and retaining and motivating our existing employees.
Restrictive immigration policy and regulatory changes may also impact our ability to hire, mobilize
or retain some of our global talent.
In addition, we believe that our corporate culture fosters innovation, creativity, and teamwork. As
our organization grows and evolves, we may need to implement more complex organizational management
structures or adapt our corporate culture and work environments to ever-changing circumstances, such
as during times of a natural disaster or pandemic (including COVID-19), and these changes could
impact our ability to compete effectively or have an adverse impact on our corporate culture.
We are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our investments and, in some instances, our
financial statements incorporate valuation methodologies that are subjective in nature resulting in
fluctuations over time.
The market value of our investments can be negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration or
losses, performance and financial results of the underlying entities, foreign exchange rates, changes
in interest rates, including changes that may result from the implementation of new benchmark rates,
the effect of new or changing regulations, the stock market in general, or other factors. The effect
of COVID-19 on our impairment assessment for non-marketable investments requires significant judgment
due to the uncertainty around the duration and severity of the impact.
We measure certain of our non-marketable equity and debt investments, certain other instruments
including stock-based compensation awards settled in the stock of certain Other Bets, and certain
assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination, at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. The
determination of fair value involves use of appropriate valuation methods and certain unobservable
inputs, require management judgment and estimation, and may change over time.
We adjust the carrying value of our non-marketable equity investments to fair value for observable
transactions of identical or similar investments of the same issuer or for impairments. All gains and
losses on non-marketable equity securities, realized and unrealized, are recognized in other income
(expense), which increases the volatility of our other income (expense). The unrealized gains and
losses we record on our non-marketable equity securities in any particular period may differ
significantly from the realized gains or losses we ultimately experience on such investments.
As a result of these factors, the value or liquidity of our cash equivalents, as well as our
marketable and non-marketable securities could decline and result in a material impairment, which
could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.
We could be subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax
legislation, or exposure to additional tax liabilities.
Our future income taxes could be negatively affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in
jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that
have higher statutory tax rates, the net gains and losses recognized by legal entities on certain
hedges and related hedged intercompany and other transactions under our foreign exchange risk
management program, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax
 23

assets or liabilities, the application of different provisions of tax laws or changes in tax laws,
regulations, or accounting principles (including changes in the interpretation of existing laws), as
well as certain discrete items.
In addition, we are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities.
As a result, we have received, and may in the future receive, assessments in multiple jurisdictions,
including in Europe, on various tax-related assertions, such as transfer-pricing adjustments or
permanent-establishment claims. Any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative
effect on our operating results and financial condition and could require us to change our business
practices in a manner adverse to our business. It may also subject us to additional litigation and
regulatory inquiries, resulting in the diversion of management’s time and attention. In addition, the
determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires
significant judgment, and there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax
determination is uncertain. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax
outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may affect our financial
results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.
Furthermore, due to shifting economic and political conditions, tax policies, laws, or rates in
various jurisdictions may be subject to significant changes in ways that impair our financial
results. Various jurisdictions around the world have enacted or are considering digital services
taxes, which could lead to inconsistent and potentially overlapp ing international tax regimes. The
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) recently released proposals relating to
its initiative for modernizing international tax rules, with the goal of having different countries
implement a modernized and aligned international tax framework, but there can be no guarantee that
this will occur.
In addition, in response to significant market volatility and disruptions to business operations
resulting from the global spread of COVID-19, legislatures and taxing authorities in many
jurisdictions in which we operate may propose changes to their tax rules. These changes could include
modifications that have temporary effect, and more permanent changes. The impact of these potential
new rules on us, our long-term tax planning, and our effective tax rate could be material.
The trading price for our Class A common stock and non-voting Class C capital stock may continue to
be volatile.
The trading price of our stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility and may continue
to be volatile.
In addition to the factors discussed in this report, the trading price of our Class A common stock
and Class C capital stock may fluctuate widely in response to various factors, many of which are
beyond our control, including, among others announcements by us or our competitors of acquisitions,
divestitures, investments, new products, significant contracts, commercial relationships, or capital
commitments; recommendations by securities analysts or changes in their earnings estimates;
announcements about our or our competitors' earnings that are not in line with analyst expectations,
the risk of which is enhanced, in our case, because it is our policy not to give guidance on
earnings; commentary by industry and market professionals about our products, strategies, and other
matters affecting our business and results, regardless of its accuracy; the volume of shares of Class
A common stock and Class C capital stock available for public sale; sales of Class A common stock and
Class C capital stock by us or by our stockholders (including sales by our directors, executive
officers, and other employees); short sales, hedging, and other derivative transactions on shares of
our Class A common stock and Class C capital stock; the size, timing and share class of any share
repurchase program; and the perceived values of Class A common stock and Class C capital stock
relative to one another.
In addition, the stock market in general, which can be affected by various factors, including overall
economic and political conditions, and the market for technology companies in particular, have
experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate
to the operating performance of those companies.
These broad market and industry factors may harm the market price of our Class A common stock and our
Class C capital stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.
