│ Item 1. BusinessBank of America Corporation is a Delaware corporation, a bank holding company │
│ (BHC) and a financial holding company. When used in this report, “the Corporation,” “we,” “us” │

│ and its subsidiaries, or certain of Bank of America Corporation’s subsidiaries or affiliates. │
│ As part of our efforts to streamline the Corporation’s organizational structure and reduce │
│ complexity and costs, the Corporation has reduced and intends to continue to reduce the number │
│ of its corporate subsidiaries, including through intercompany mergers.Bank of America is one of │
│ the world’s largest financial institutions, serving individual consumers, small- and │
│ middle-market businesses, institutional investors, large corporations and governments with a │
│ full range of banking, investing, asset management and other financial and risk management │

│ continues to be, impacted by the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic (the pandemic). │
│ In an attempt to contain the spread and impact of the pandemic, travel bans and restrictions, │
│ quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and other limitations on business activity have │
╭─ • ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│ been implemented. Additionally, there has been a decline in global economic activity, reduced │
│ U.S. and global economic output and a deterioration in macroeconomic conditions in the U.S. and │
│ globally. This has resulted in, among other things, higher rates of unemployment and │
│ underemployment and caused volatility and disruptions in the global financial markets during │
│ 2020, including the energy and commodity markets.In response to the pandemic, the Corporation │
│ has been taking a proactive role in addressing the impact of the pandemic on its employees, its │
│ operations, its clients and the community, including the implementation of protocols and │
│ processes to execute its business continuity plans and help protect its employees and support │
│ its clients. The Corporation is managing its response to the pandemic according to its │
│ Enterprise Response Framework, which invokes centralized management of the crisis event and the │
│ integration of the Corporation’s enterprise-wide response.Although some restrictive measures │
│ have been eased in certain areas, many restrictive measures remain in place or have been │
│ reinstated, and in some cases additional restrictive measures are being or may need to be │
│ implemented in light of the increase in COVID-19 cases in recent months in the U.S. and in many │
│ other regions of the world. Businesses, market participants, our counterparties and clients, │
│ and the U.S. and global economies have been negatively impacted and are likely to remain so for │
│ an extended period of time, as there remains significant uncertainty about the magnitude and │
│ duration of the pandemic and the timing and strength of an economic recovery. For more │
│ information regarding COVID-19, see Item 1A. Risk Factors – Coronavirus Disease on page 7 and │
│ Executive Summary – Recent Developments – COVID-19 Pandemic in the MD&A on page │

 Bank of America2 
motivate our existing employees, while managing
compensation and other costs.
 Human Capital Resources 
We strive to make Bank of America a great place
to work for our employees. We value our employees
and seek to establish and maintain human resource
policies that are consistent with our core values
and that help realize the power of our people.
Our Board and its committees, including the
Compensation and Human Capital, Audit, Enterprise
Risk, and Corporate Governance, ESG and
Sustainability Committees, provide oversight of
our human capital management strategies, programs
and practices. The Corporation’s senior
management provides regular briefings on human
capital matters to the Board and its Committees
to facilitate the Board’s oversight.
At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Corporation
employed approximately 213,000 and 208,000
employees, of which 82 percent were located in
the U.S. at both dates. None of our U.S.
employees are subject to a collective bargaining
agreement. Additionally, in 2020 and 2019, the
Corporation’s compensation and benefits expense
was $32.7 billion and $32.0 billion, or 59
percent and 58 percent, of total noninterest
expense.
 Diversity and Inclusion 
The Corporation’s commitment to diversity and
inclusion starts at the top of the Corporation
with oversight from our Board and CEO. The
Corporation’s senior management sets the
diversity and inclusion goals of the Corporation,
and the Chief Human Resources Officer and Chief
Diversity & Inclusion Officer partner with our
CEO and senior management to drive our diversity
and inclusion strategy, programs, initiatives and
policies. The Global Diversity and Inclusion
Council, which consists of senior executives from
every line of business and is chaired by our CEO,
has been in place for over 20 years. The Council
sponsors and supports business, operating unit
and regional diversity and inclusion councils to
ensure alignment to enterprise diversity
strategies and goals.
Our practices and policies have resulted in
strong representation across the Corporation
where our broad employee population mirrors the
clients and communities we serve. We have a Board
and senior management team that are 47 percent
and 50 percent racially, ethnically and gender
diverse. As of December 31, 2020, over 50 percent
of employees were women, and, among U.S.-based
employees, nearly 48 percent were people of
color, 14 percent were Black/African American and
19 percent were Hispanic/Latino. As of December
31, 2020, the Corporation’s top three management
levels in relation to the CEO were composed of
more than 42 percent women and nearly 20 percent
people of color. These workforce diversity
metrics are reported regularly to the senior
management team and to the Board and are publicly
disclosed on our website.
We invest in our leadership by offering a range
of development programs and resources that allow
employees to develop and progress in their
careers. We reinforce our commitment to diversity
and inclusion by investing internally in our
employee networks and by facilitating
conversations with employees about racial, social
and economic issues. Further, we partner with
various external organizations, which focus on
advancing diverse talent. We also have practices
in place for attracting and retaining diverse
talent, including campus recruitment. For
example, in 2020, approximately 45 percent of our
campus hires were women, and, in the U.S.,
approximately 54 percent were people of color.
 Employee Engagement and Talent Retention 
As part of our ongoing efforts to make the
Corporation a great place to work, we have
conducted a confidential annual Employee
Engagement Survey (Survey) for nearly two
decades. The Survey results are reviewed by the
Board and senior management and used to assist in
reviewing the Corporation’s human capital
strategies, programs and practices. In 2020, more
than 90 percent of the Corporation’s employees
participated in the Survey, and our Employee
Engagement Index, an overall measure of employee
satisfaction with the Corporation, was 91
percent. In 2020, we also had historically low
turnover among our employees of seven percent.
 Fair and Equitable Compensation 
The Corporation is committed to racial and gender
pay equity by striving to fairly and equitably
compensate all of our employees. We maintain
robust policies and practices that reinforce our
commitment, including reviews with oversight from
our Board and senior management. In 2020, our
review covered our regional hubs (U.S., U.K.,
France, Ireland, Hong Kong, and Singapore) and
India and showed that compensation received by
women, on average, was greater than 99 percent of
that received by men in comparable positions and,
in the U.S., compensation received by people of
color was, on average, greater than 99 percent of
that received by teammates who are not people of
color in comparable positions.
We also strive to pay our employees fairly based
on market rates for their roles, experience and
how they perform, and we regularly benchmark
against other companies both within and outside
our industry to help ensure our pay is
competitive. In the first quarter of 2020, we
raised our minimum hourly wage for U.S. employees
to $20 per hour, which is above all governmental
minimum wage levels in all jurisdictions in which
we operate in the U.S.
 Health and Wellness – 2020 Focus 
The Corporation also is committed to supporting
employees’ physical, emotional and financial
wellness by offering flexible and competitive
benefits, including comprehensive health and
insurance benefits and wellness resources. In
2020, we took steps to support our employees
during the ongoing health crisis resulting from
the pandemic, including monitoring guidance from
the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, medical boards and health authorities
and sharing such guidance with our employees. In
addition, as a result of the pandemic we
transitioned to a work-from-home posture for the
substantial majority of our employees and
provided various benefits and resources related
to the pandemic, including the implementation of
child and adult care solutions, offering no-cost
COVID-19 testing and mental health resources and
additional support for teammates who work in the
office, such as transportation and meal
subsidies. We continue to engage with state and
national governments to understand their
vaccination plans for essential workers,
including the extent to which that may include
some of our employees, and with our employees to
educate them about vaccines and the importance of
being vaccinated. For more information on our
response to the pandemic, including with respect
to human capital measures, see Executive Summary
– Recent Developments – COVID-19 Pandemic on page
25.
 Government Supervision and Regulation 
The following discussion describes, among other
things, elements of an extensive regulatory
framework applicable to BHCs, financial holding
companies, banks and broker-dealers, including
specific information about Bank of America.
 3Bank of America 
We are subject to an extensive regulatory
framework applicable to BHCs, financial holding
companies and banks and other financial services
entities. U.S. federal regulation of banks, BHCs
and financial holding companies is intended
primarily for the protection of depositors and
the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) rather than for
the protection of shareholders and creditors.
As a registered financial holding company and
BHC, the Corporation is subject to the
supervision of, and regular inspection by, the
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
(Federal Reserve). Our U.S. bank subsidiaries
(the Banks), organized as national banking
associations, are subject to regulation,
supervision and examination by the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the
Federal Reserve. In addition, the Federal Reserve
and the OCC have adopted guidelines that
establish minimum standards for the design,
implementation and board oversight of BHCs’ and
national banks’ risk governance frameworks. U.S.
financial holding companies, and the companies
under their control, are permitted to engage in
activities considered “financial in nature” as
defined by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and related
Federal Reserve interpretations. The
Corporation's status as a financial holding
company is conditioned upon maintaining certain
eligibility requirements for both the Corporation
and its U.S. depository institution subsidiaries,
including minimum capital ratios, supervisory
ratings and, in the case of the depository
institutions, at least satisfactory Community
Reinvestment Act ratings. Failure to be an
eligible financial holding company could result
in the Federal Reserve limiting Bank of America's
activities, including potential acquisitions.
The scope of the laws and regulations and the
intensity of the supervision to which we are
subject have increased over the past several
years, beginning with the response to the
financial crisis, as well as other factors such
as technological and market changes. In addition,
the banking and financial services sector is
subject to substantial regulatory enforcement and
fines. Many of these changes have occurred as a
result of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform
and Consumer Protection Act (the Financial Reform
Act). We cannot assess whether there will be any
additional major changes in the regulatory
environment and expect that our business will
remain subject to continuing and extensive
regulation and supervision.
We are also subject to various other laws and
regulations, as well as supervision and
examination by other regulatory agencies, all of
which directly or indirectly affect our entities
and management and our ability to make
distributions to shareholders. For instance, our
broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to both
U.S. and international regulation, including
supervision by the SEC, Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority and New York Stock Exchange,
among others; our futures commission merchant
subsidiaries supporting commodities and
derivatives businesses in the U.S. are subject to
regulation by and supervision of the U.S.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC),
National Futures Association, the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange and in the case of the Banks,
certain banking regulators; our insurance
activities are subject to licensing and
regulation by state insurance regulatory
agencies; and our consumer financial products and
services are regulated by the Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau (CFPB).
Our non-U.S. businesses are also subject to
extensive regulation by various non-U.S.
regulators, including governments, securities
exchanges, prudential regulators, central banks
and other regulatory bodies, in the jurisdictions
in which those businesses operate. For example,
our financial
services entities in the United Kingdom (U.K.),
Ireland and France are subject to regulation by
the Prudential Regulatory Authority and Financial
Conduct Authority, the European Central Bank and
Central Bank of Ireland, and the Autorité de
Contrôle Prudentiel et de Résolution and Autorité
des Marchés Financiers, respectively.
 Source of Strength 
Under the Financial Reform Act and Federal
Reserve policy, BHCs are expected to act as a
source of financial strength to each subsidiary
bank and to commit resources to support each such
subsidiary. Similarly, under the cross-guarantee
provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA), in
the event of a loss suffered or anticipated by
the FDIC, either as a result of default of a bank
subsidiary or related to FDIC assistance provided
to such a subsidiary in danger of default, the
affiliate banks of such a subsidiary may be
assessed for the FDIC’s loss, subject to certain
exceptions.
 Transactions with Affiliates 
Pursuant to Section 23A and 23B of the Federal
Reserve Act, as implemented by the Federal
Reserve’s Regulation W, the Banks are subject to
restrictions that limit certain types of
transactions between the Banks and their nonbank
affiliates. In general, U.S. banks are subject to
quantitative and qualitative limits on extensions
of credit, purchases of assets and certain other
transactions involving their nonbank affiliates.
Additionally, transactions between U.S. banks and
their nonbank affiliates are required to be on
arm’s length terms and must be consistent with
standards of safety and soundness.
 Deposit Insurance 
Deposits placed at U.S. domiciled banks are
insured by the FDIC, subject to limits and
conditions of applicable law and the FDIC’s
regulations. Pursuant to the Financial Reform
Act, FDIC insurance coverage limits are $250,000
per customer. All insured depository institutions
are required to pay assessments to the FDIC in
order to fund the DIF.
The FDIC is required to maintain at least a
designated minimum ratio of the DIF to insured
deposits in the U.S. The FDIC adopted regulations
that establish a long-term target DIF ratio of
greater than two percent. As of the date of this
report, the DIF ratio is below this required
target, and the FDIC has adopted a restoration
plan that may result in increased deposit
insurance assessments. Deposit insurance
assessment rates are subject to change by the
FDIC and will be impacted by the overall economy
and the stability of the banking industry as a
whole. For more information regarding deposit
insurance, see Item 1A. Risk Factors –
Regulatory, Compliance and Legal on page 16.
 Capital, Liquidity and Operational Requirements 
As a financial holding company, we and our bank
subsidiaries are subject to the regulatory
capital and liquidity rules issued by the Federal
Reserve and other U.S. banking regulators,
including the OCC and the FDIC. These rules are
complex and are evolving as U.S. and
international regulatory authorities propose and
enact amendments to these rules. The Corporation
seeks to manage its capital position to maintain
sufficient capital to satisfy these regulatory
rules and to support our business activities.
These continually evolving rules are likely to
influence our planning processes and may require
additional regulatory capital and liquidity, as
well as impose additional operational and
compliance costs on the Corporation.
For more information on regulatory capital rules,
capital composition and pending or proposed
regulatory capital
 Bank of America4 
changes, see Capital Management on page 50, and
Note 16 – Regulatory Requirements and
Restrictions to the Consolidated Financial
Statements, which are incorporated by reference
in this Item 1.
 Distributions 
We are subject to various regulatory policies and
requirements relating to capital actions,
including payment of dividends and common stock
repurchases. For instance, Federal Reserve
regulations require major U.S. BHCs to submit a
capital plan as part of an annual Comprehensive
Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR).
Our ability to pay dividends and make common
stock repurchases depends in part on our ability
to maintain regulatory capital levels above
minimum requirements plus buffers and non-capital
standards established under the FDICIA. To the
extent that the Federal Reserve increases our
stress capital buffer (SCB), global systemically
important bank (G-SIB) surcharge or
countercyclical capital buffer, our returns of
capital to shareholders could decrease. As part
of its CCAR, the Federal Reserve conducts stress
testing on parts of our business using
hypothetical economic scenarios prepared by the
Federal Reserve. Those scenarios may affect our
CCAR stress test results, which may impact the
level of our SCB. Additionally, the Federal
Reserve may impose limitations or prohibitions on
taking capital actions such as paying or
increasing common stock dividends or repurchasing
common stock. For example, as a result of the
economic uncertainty resulting from the pandemic,
the Federal Reserve required that during the
second half of 2020, all large banks, including
the Corporation, suspend share repurchase
programs, except for repurchases to offset shares
awarded under equity-based compensation plans,
and limit common stock dividends to existing
rates that did not exceed the average of the last
four quarters' net income. In the first quarter
of 2021, the Federal Reserve lifted the
suspension of share repurchase programs and
permitted large banks to pay common stock
dividends and to repurchase shares in an amount
that, when combined with dividends paid, does not
exceed the average of net income over the last
four quarters.
If the Federal Reserve finds that any of our
Banks are not “well-capitalized” or “well-
managed,” we would be required to enter into an
agreement with the Federal Reserve to comply with
all applicable capital and management
requirements, which may contain additional
limitations or conditions relating to our
activities. Additionally, the applicable federal
regulatory authority is authorized to determine,
under certain circumstances relating to the
financial condition of a bank or BHC, that the
payment of dividends would be an unsafe or
unsound practice and to prohibit payment thereof.
For more information regarding the requirements
relating to the payment of dividends, including
the minimum capital requirements, see Note 13 –
Shareholders’ Equity and Note 16 – Regulatory
Requirements and Restrictions to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.
Many of our subsidiaries, including our bank and
broker-dealer subsidiaries, are subject to laws
that restrict dividend payments, or authorize
regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of
funds from those subsidiaries to the parent
company or other subsidiaries. The rights of the
Corporation, our shareholders and our creditors
to participate in any distribution of the assets
or earnings of our subsidiaries is further
subject to the prior claims of creditors of the
respective subsidiaries.
 Resolution Planning 
As a BHC with greater than $250 billion of
assets, the Corporation is required by the
Federal Reserve and the FDIC to periodically
submit a plan for a rapid and orderly resolution
in the event of material financial distress or
failure.
Such resolution plan is intended to be a detailed
roadmap for the orderly resolution of the BHC,
including the continued operations or solvent
wind down of its material entities, pursuant to
the U.S. Bankruptcy Code under one or more
hypothetical scenarios assuming no extraordinary
government assistance.
If both the Federal Reserve and the FDIC
determine that the BHC’s plan is not credible,
the Federal Reserve and the FDIC may jointly
impose more stringent capital, leverage or
liquidity requirements or restrictions on growth,
activities or operations. A summary of our plan
is available on the Federal Reserve and FDIC
websites.
The FDIC also requires the submission of a
resolution plan for Bank of America, National
Association (BANA), which must describe how the
insured depository institution would be resolved
under the bank resolution provisions of the
Federal Deposit Insurance Act. A description of
this plan is available on the FDIC’s website.
We continue to make substantial progress to
enhance our resolvability, including simplifying
our legal entity structure and business
operations, and increasing our preparedness to
implement our resolution plan, both from a
financial and operational standpoint.
Across international jurisdictions, resolution
planning is the responsibility of national
resolution authorities (RA). Among those, the
jurisdictions of most impact to the Corporation
are the requirements associated with subsidiaries
in the U.K., Ireland and France, where rules have
been issued requiring the submission of
significant information about locally-
incorporated subsidiaries (including information
on intra-group dependencies, legal entity
separation and barriers to resolution) as well as
the Corporation’s banking branches located in
those jurisdictions that are deemed to be
material for resolution planning purposes. As a
result of the RA's review of the submitted
information, we could be required to take certain
actions over the next several years that could
increase operating costs and potentially result
in the restructuring of certain businesses and
subsidiaries.
For more information regarding our resolution
plan, see Item 1A. Risk Factors – Liquidity on
page 9.
 Insolvency and the Orderly Liquidation Authority 
Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, the FDIC
may be appointed receiver of an insured
depository institution if it is insolvent or in
certain other circumstances. In addition, under
the Financial Reform Act, when a systemically
important financial institution (SIFI) such as
the Corporation is in default or danger of
default, the FDIC may be appointed receiver in
order to conduct an orderly liquidation of such
institution. In the event of such appointment,
the FDIC could, among other things, invoke the
orderly liquidation authority, instead of the
U.S. Bankruptcy Code, if the Secretary of the
Treasury makes certain financial distress and
systemic risk determinations. The orderly
liquidation authority is modeled in part on the
Federal Deposit Insurance Act, but also adopts
certain concepts from the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
The orderly liquidation authority contains
certain differences from the U.S. Bankruptcy
Code. For example, in certain circumstances, the
FDIC could permit payment of obligations it
determines to be systemically significant (e.g.,
short-term
 5Bank of America 
creditors or operating creditors) in lieu of
paying other obligations (e.g., long-term
creditors) without the need to obtain creditors’
consent or prior court review. The insolvency and
resolution process could also lead to a large
reduction or total elimination of the value of a
BHC’s outstanding equity, as well as impairment
or elimination of certain debt.
Under the FDIC’s “single point of entry” strategy
for resolving SIFIs, the FDIC could replace a
distressed BHC with a bridge holding company,
which could continue operations and result in an
orderly resolution of the underlying bank, but
whose equity is held solely for the benefit of
creditors of the original BHC.
Furthermore, the Federal Reserve requires that
BHCs maintain minimum levels of long-term debt
required to provide adequate loss absorbing
capacity in the event of a resolution.
For more information regarding our resolution,
see Item 1A. Risk Factors – Liquidity on page 9.
 Limitations on Acquisitions 
The Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching
Efficiency Act of 1994 permits a BHC to acquire
banks located in states other than its home state
without regard to state law, subject to certain
conditions, including the condition that the BHC,
after and as a result of the acquisition,
controls no more than 10 percent of the total
amount of deposits of insured depository
institutions in the U.S. and no more than 30
percent or such lesser or greater amount set by
state law of such deposits in that state. At June
30, 2020, we held greater than 10 percent of the
total amount of deposits of insured depository
institutions in the U.S.
In addition, the Financial Reform Act restricts
acquisitions by a financial institution if, as a
result of the acquisition, the total liabilities
of the financial institution would exceed 10
percent of the total liabilities of all financial
institutions in the U.S. At June 30, 2020, our
liabilities did not exceed 10 percent of the
total liabilities of all financial institutions
in the U.S.
 The Volcker Rule 
The Volcker Rule prohibits insured depository
institutions and companies affiliated with
insured depository institutions (collectively,
banking entities) from engaging in short-term
proprietary trading of certain securities,
derivatives, commodity futures and options for
their own account. The Volcker Rule also imposes
limits on banking entities’ investments in, and
other relationships with, hedge funds and private
equity funds. The Volcker Rule provides
exemptions for certain activities, including
market making, underwriting, hedging, trading in
government obligations, insurance company
activities and organizing and offering hedge
funds and private equity funds. The Volcker Rule
also clarifies that certain activities are not
prohibited, including acting as agent, broker or
custodian. A banking entity with significant
trading operations, such as the Corporation, is
required to maintain a detailed compliance
program to comply with the restrictions of the
Volcker Rule.
 Derivatives 
Our derivatives operations are subject to
extensive regulation globally. These operations
are subject to regulation under the Financial
Reform Act, the European Union (EU) Markets in
Financial Instruments Directive and Regulation,
the European Market Infrastructure Regulation,
analogous U.K. regulatory regimes and similar
regulatory regimes in other jurisdictions, that
regulate or will regulate the derivatives markets
in which we operate by, among other things:
requiring clearing and exchange trading of
certain derivatives; imposing new capital,
margin, reporting, registration and business
conduct requirements for certain market
participants; imposing position limits on certain
over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives; and imposing
derivatives trading transparency requirements.
Regulations of derivatives are already in effect
in many markets in which we operate.
In addition, many G-20 jurisdictions, including
the U.S., U.K., Germany and Japan, have adopted
resolution stay regulations to address concerns
that the close-out of derivatives and other
financial contracts in resolution could impede
orderly resolution of G-SIBs, and additional
jurisdictions are expected to follow suit.
Generally, these resolution stay regulations
require amendment of certain financial contracts
to provide for contractual recognition of stays
of termination rights under various statutory
resolution regimes and a stay on the exercise of
cross-default rights based on an affiliate’s
entry into insolvency proceedings. As resolution
stay regulations of a particular jurisdiction
applicable to us go into effect, we amend
impacted financial contracts in compliance with
such regulations either as a regulated entity or
as a counterparty facing a regulated entity in
such jurisdiction.
 Consumer Regulations 
Our consumer businesses are subject to extensive
regulation and oversight by federal and state
regulators. Certain federal consumer finance laws
to which we are subject, including the Equal
Credit Opportunity Act, Home Mortgage Disclosure
Act, Electronic Fund Transfer Act, Fair Credit
Reporting Act, Real Estate Settlement Procedures
Act, Truth in Lending Act and Truth in Savings
Act, are enforced by the CFPB. Other federal
consumer finance laws, such as the Servicemembers
Civil Relief Act, are enforced by the OCC.
 Privacy and Information Security 
We are subject to many U.S. federal, state and
international laws and regulations governing
requirements for maintaining policies and
procedures regarding the disclosure, use and
protection of the non-public confidential
information of our customers and employees. The
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requires us to
periodically disclose Bank of America’s privacy
policies and practices relating to sharing such
information and enables retail customers to opt
out of our ability to share information with
unaffiliated third parties, under certain
circumstances. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and
other laws also require us to implement a
comprehensive information security program that
includes administrative, technical and physical
safeguards to provide the security and
confidentiality of customer records and
information. Security and privacy policies and
procedures for the protection of personal and
confidential information are in effect across all
businesses and geographic locations.
Other laws and regulations, at the international,
federal and state level, impact our ability to
share certain information with affiliates and
non-affiliates for marketing and/or non-marketing
purposes, or contact customers with marketing
offers and establish certain rights of consumers
in connection with their personal information.
For example, California’s Consumer Privacy Act
(CCPA), which went into effect in January 2020,
as modified by the California Privacy Rights Act
(CPRA), provides consumers with the right to know
what personal data is being collected, know
whether their personal data is sold or disclosed
and to whom and opt out of the sale of their
personal data, among other rights. In addition,
in the EU, the General Data Protection Regulation
(GDPR) replaced the Data Protection Directive and
related implementing national laws in its member
states. The CCPA's, CPRA's and GDPR’s impact on
the Corporation was assessed and addressed
through comprehensive compliance implementation
programs. These existing and evolving legal
requirements in the U.S. and abroad,
 Bank of America6 
as well as court proceedings and changing
guidance from regulatory bodies with respect to
the validity of cross-border data transfer
mechanisms from the EU, continue to lend
uncertainty to privacy compliance globally.

│ Item 1A. Risk Factors │
The discussion below addresses the material
factors of which we are currently aware that
could affect our businesses, results of
operations and financial condition. However,
other factors not currently known to us or that
we currently deem immaterial could also adversely
affect our businesses, results of operations and
financial condition. Therefore, the risk factors
below should not be considered all of the
potential risks that we may face. For more
information on how we manage risks, see Managing
Risk in the MD&A on page 47. For more information
about the risks contained in the Risk Factors
section, see Item 1. Business on page 2, MD&A on
page 24 and Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements on page 101.
 Coronavirus Disease 
The effects of the pandemic have adversely
affected, and are expected to continue to
adversely affect, our businesses and results of
operations, and its duration and future impacts
on the economy and our businesses, results of
operations and financial condition remain
uncertain.
The negative economic conditions arising from the
pandemic negatively impacted our financial
results during 2020 in various respects,
including contributing to increases in our
allowance and provision for credit losses and
noninterest expense. These negative economic
conditions may have a continued adverse effect on
our businesses and results of operations, which
could include: decreased demand for and use of
our products and services; protracted periods of
historically low interest rates; lower fees,
including asset management fees; lower sales and
trading revenue due to decreased market liquidity
resulting from heightened volatility; higher
levels of uncollectible reversed charges in our
merchant services business; increased noninterest
expense, including operational losses; and
increased credit losses due to our customers' and
clients' inability to fulfill contractual
obligations and deterioration in the financial
condition of our consumer and commercial
borrowers, which may vary by region, sector or
industry, that may increase our provision for
credit losses and net charge-offs. Our provision
for credit losses and net charge-offs may also
continue to be impacted by volatility in the
energy and commodity markets. Additionally, our
liquidity and/or regulatory capital could be
adversely impacted by customers’ withdrawal of
deposits, volatility and disruptions in the
capital and credit markets, volatility in foreign
exchange rates and customer draws on lines of
credit. Continued adverse macroeconomic
conditions could also result in potential
downgrades to our credit ratings, negative
impacts to regulatory capital and liquidity and
further restrictions on dividends and/or common
stock repurchases.
If we become unable to operate our businesses
from remote locations including, for example,
because of an internal or external failure of our
information technology infrastructure, we
experience increased rates of employee illness or
unavailability, or governmental restrictions are
placed on our employees or operations, this could
adversely affect our business continuity status
and result in disruption to our businesses.
Additionally, we rely on third parties who could
experience adverse effects on their business
continuity and business interruptions, which
could increase our risks and adversely impact our
businesses.
There can be no assurance that current or future
governmental fiscal and monetary relief programs
will stimulate
the global economy or avert negative economic or
market conditions. Our participation in such
programs could result in reputational harm and
government actions and proceedings, and has
resulted in, and may continue to result in,
litigation, including class actions. Such actions
may result in judgments, settlements, penalties,
and fines. Our participation in such programs has
also resulted and may continue to result in
operational losses, including from the Paycheck
Protection Program (PPP) and processing
unemployment insurance.
We continue to closely monitor the pandemic and
related risks as they evolve globally and in the
U.S. The magnitude and duration of the pandemic
and its future direct and indirect effects on the
global economy and our businesses, results of
operations and financial condition are highly
uncertain and depend on future developments that
cannot be predicted, including the likelihood of
further surges of COVID-19 cases and the spread
of more easily communicable variants of COVID-19,
the timing and availability of effective medical
treatments and vaccines, future actions taken by
governmental authorities, including additional
stimulus legislation, and/or other third parties
in response to the pandemic. The pandemic may
cause prolonged global or national negative
economic conditions or longer lasting effects on
economic conditions than currently exist, which
could have a material adverse effect on our
businesses, results of operations and financial
condition.
Market
Our business and results of operations may be
adversely affected by the financial markets,
fiscal, monetary, and regulatory policies, and
economic conditions generally.
General economic, political, social and health
conditions in the U.S. and in one or more
countries abroad affect markets in the U.S. and
abroad and our business. In particular, markets
in the U.S. or abroad may be affected by the
level and volatility of interest rates,
availability and market conditions of financing,
unexpected changes in gross domestic product
(GDP), economic growth or its sustainability,
inflation, consumer spending, employment levels,
wage stagnation, federal government shutdowns,
developments related to the federal debt ceiling,
energy prices, home prices, bankruptcies, a
default by a significant market participant,
fluctuations or other significant changes in both
debt and equity capital markets and currencies,
liquidity of the global financial markets, the
growth of global trade and commerce, trade
policies, the availability and cost of capital
and credit, disruption of communication,
transportation or energy infrastructure and
investor sentiment and confidence. Additionally,
global markets, including energy and commodity
markets, may be adversely affected by the current
or anticipated impact of climate change, extreme
weather events or natural disasters, the
emergence of widespread health emergencies or
pandemics, cyber attacks or campaigns, military
conflict, terrorism or other geopolitical events.
Market fluctuations may impact our margin
requirements and affect our business liquidity.
Also, any sudden or prolonged market downturn in
the U.S. or abroad, as a result of the above
factors or otherwise, could result in a decline
in net interest income and noninterest income and
adversely affect our results of operations and
financial condition, including capital and
liquidity levels. For example, the global
markets, including the energy and commodity
markets, experienced significant volatility and
disruption as a result of the uncertainty and
economic impact of the pandemic. Further
uncertainty and ongoing developments in
connection with the pandemic, including its
further spread, changing consumer and business
behaviors, government restrictions in an effort
to control the virus and timing and availability
of effective medical treatments and vaccines,
could
 7Bank of America 
result in further market volatility and
disruptions globally and continue to adversely
impact macroeconomic conditions.
Actions taken by the Federal Reserve, including
changes in its target funds rate, balance sheet
management, and lending facilities, and other
central banks are beyond our control and
difficult to predict. These actions can affect
interest rates and the value of financial
instruments and other assets and liabilities, and
impact our borrowers. The continued protracted
period of lower interest rates has resulted in
lower revenue through lower net interest income,
which has adversely affected our results of
operations. Additional periods of lower interest
rates or a move to negative interest rates in the
U.S., could have a further adverse impact on our
net interest income and results of operations.
Uncertainty or ongoing developments in connection
with the U.K.’s exit from the EU, and the
resulting impact on the financial markets and
regulations in relevant jurisdictions, could
negatively impact our revenues and ongoing
operations in Europe and other jurisdictions.
Changes to existing U.S. laws and regulatory
policies, including those related to financial
regulation, taxation, international trade, fiscal
policy and healthcare, may adversely impact U.S.
or global economic activity and our customers',
our counterparties' and our earnings and
operations. For example, additional fiscal
stimulus and rising debt levels, in the U.S. and
abroad, in response to the ongoing pandemic could
affect macroeconomic conditions, market liquidity
conditions, and interest rates. Significant
fiscal policy changes and/or initiatives,
including as a result of the change in the U.S.
presidential administration and Congress, may
also increase uncertainty surrounding the
formulation and direction of U.S. monetary policy
and volatility of interest rates. Higher U.S.
interest rates relative to other major economies
could increase the likelihood of a more volatile
and appreciating U.S. dollar. Changes, or
proposed changes, to certain U.S. trade and
international investment policies, particularly
with important trading partners (including China
and the EU) have negatively impacted and may
continue to negatively impact financial markets,
disrupt world trade and commerce and lead to
trade retaliation, including through the use of
tariffs, foreign exchange measures or the large-
scale sale of U.S. Treasury Bonds. Further, the
use of tariffs among countries not directly
involving the U.S. could spread and could damage
our customers directly and indirectly.
Any of these developments could adversely affect
our consumer and commercial businesses, our
customers, our securities and derivatives
portfolios, including the risk of lower re-
investment rates within those portfolios, our
level of charge-offs and provision for credit
losses, the carrying value of our deferred tax
assets, our capital levels, our liquidity and our
results of operations. Additionally, the
uncertainty related to the transition from
Interbank Offered Rates (IBORs) and other
benchmark rates to alternative reference rates
(ARRs) could negatively impact markets globally
and our business, and/or magnify any negative
impact of the above referenced factors on our
business, customers and results of operations.
Increased market volatility and adverse changes
in financial or capital market conditions may
increase our market risk.
Our liquidity, competitive position, business,
results of operations and financial condition are
affected by market risks such as changes in
interest and currency exchange rates,
fluctuations in equity and futures prices, lower
trading volumes and prices of securitized
products, the implied volatility of interest
rates and credit spreads and other economic and
business factors. These market risks may
adversely affect, among other things, the value
of our on- and off-balance sheet
securities, trading assets and other financial
instruments, the cost of debt capital and our
access to credit markets, the value of assets
under management (AUM), fee income relating to
AUM, customer allocation of capital among
investment alternatives, the volume of client
activity in our trading operations, investment
banking fees, the general profitability and risk
level of the transactions in which we engage and
our competitiveness with respect to deposit
pricing. For example, the value of certain of our
assets is sensitive to changes in market interest
rates. If the Federal Reserve or a non-U.S.
central bank changes or signals a change in
monetary policy, market interest rates could be
affected, which could adversely impact the value
of such assets. Changes to fiscal policy,
including rapid expansion of U.S. federal deficit
spending and resultant debt issuance, could also
affect market interest rates. In addition, the
low interest rate environment and a flat or
inverted yield curve has had and could continue
to have a negative impact on our results of
operations, including on future revenue and
earnings growth.
We use various models and strategies to assess
and control our market risk exposures, but those
are subject to inherent limitations. In times of
market stress or other unforeseen circumstances,
previously uncorrelated indicators may become
correlated and vice versa. These types of market
movements may limit the effectiveness of our
hedging strategies and cause us to incur
significant losses. These changes in correlation
can be exacerbated where other market
participants are using risk or trading models
with assumptions or algorithms similar to ours.
In these and other cases, it may be difficult to
reduce our risk positions due to activity of
other market participants or widespread market
dislocations, including circumstances where asset
values are declining significantly or no market
exists for certain assets. To the extent that we
own securities that do not have an established
liquid trading market or are otherwise subject to
restrictions on sale or hedging, we may not be
able to reduce our positions and therefore reduce
our risk associated with such positions.
We may incur losses if the value of assets
decline, including due to changes in interest
rates and prepayment speeds.
We have a large portfolio of financial
instruments, including loans and loan
commitments, securities financing agreements,
asset-backed secured financings, derivative
assets and liabilities, debt securities,
marketable equity securities and certain other
assets and liabilities that we measure at fair
value that are subject to valuation and
impairment assessments. We determine these values
based on applicable accounting guidance, which
for financial instruments measured at fair value,
requires an entity to base fair value on exit
price and to maximize the use of observable
inputs and minimize the use of unobservable
inputs in fair value measurements. The fair
values of these financial instruments include
adjustments for market liquidity, credit quality,
funding impact on certain derivatives and other
transaction-specific factors, where appropriate.
Gains or losses on these instruments can have a
direct impact on our results of operations,
unless we have effectively hedged our exposures.
Increases in interest rates may result in a
decrease in residential mortgage loan
originations. In addition, increases in interest
rates may adversely impact the fair value of debt
securities and, accordingly, for debt securities
classified as available for sale, may adversely
affect accumulated other comprehensive income
and, thus, capital levels. Decreases in interest
rates may increase prepayment speeds of certain
assets, and therefore may adversely affect net
interest income.
Fair values may be impacted by declining values
of the underlying assets or the prices at which
observable market
 Bank of America8 
transactions occur and the continued availability
of these transactions or indices. The financial
strength of counterparties, with whom we have
economically hedged some of our exposure to these
assets, also will affect the fair value of these
assets. Sudden declines and volatility in the
prices of assets may curtail or eliminate trading
activities in these assets, which may make it
difficult to sell, hedge or value these assets.
The inability to sell or effectively hedge assets
reduces our ability to limit losses in such
positions and the difficulty in valuing assets
may increase our risk-weighted assets (RWA),
which requires us to maintain additional capital
and increases our funding costs. Values of AUM
also impact revenues in our wealth management and
related advisory businesses for asset-based
management and performance fees. Declines in
values of AUM can result in lower fees earned for
managing such assets.
 Liquidity 
If we are unable to access the capital markets or
continue to maintain deposits, or our borrowing
costs increase, our liquidity and competitive
position will be negatively affected.
Liquidity is essential to our businesses. We fund
our assets primarily with globally sourced
deposits in our bank entities, as well as secured
and unsecured liabilities transacted in the
capital markets. We rely on certain secured
funding sources, such as repo markets, which are
typically short-term and credit-sensitive in
nature. We also engage in asset securitization
transactions, including with the government-
sponsored enterprises (GSEs), to fund consumer
lending activities. Our liquidity could be
adversely affected by any inability to access the
capital markets, illiquidity or volatility in the
capital markets, the decrease in value of
eligible collateral or increased collateral
requirements (including as a result of credit
concerns for short-term borrowing), changes to
our relationships with our funding providers
based on real or perceived changes in our risk
profile, prolonged federal government shutdowns,
or changes in regulations, guidance or GSE status
that impact our funding avenues or ability to
access certain funding sources. Additionally, our
liquidity may be negatively impacted by the
unwillingness or inability of the Federal Reserve
to act as lender of last resort, unexpected
simultaneous draws on lines of credit, slower
customer payment rates, restricted access to the
assets of prime brokerage clients, the withdrawal
of or failure to attract customer deposits or
invested funds (which could result from customer
attrition for higher yields, the desire for more
conservative alternatives or our customers’
increased need for cash), increased regulatory
liquidity, capital and margin requirements for
our U.S. or international banks and their nonbank
subsidiaries, changes in patterns of intraday
liquidity usage resulting from a counterparty or
technology failure or other idiosyncratic event
or failure or default by a significant market
participant or third party (including clearing
agents, custodians or central counterparties
(CCPs)). These factors also have the potential to
increase our borrowing costs.
Several of these factors may arise due to
circumstances beyond our control, such as general
market volatility, disruption, shock or stress,
the emergence of widespread health emergencies or
pandemics, Federal Reserve policy decisions
(including fluctuations in interest rates or
Federal Reserve balance sheet composition),
negative views about the Corporation (including
short- and long-term business prospects) or the
financial services industry generally or due to a
specific news event, changes in the regulatory
environment or governmental fiscal or monetary
policies (including as a result of the change in
the U.S. presidential administration and
Congress), actions by credit rating agencies or
an operational
problem that affects third parties or us. The
impact of these events, whether within our
control or not, could include an inability to
sell assets or redeem investments, unforeseen
outflows of cash, the need to draw on liquidity
facilities, the reduction of financing balances
and the loss of equity secured funding, debt
repurchases to support the secondary market or
meet client requests, the need for additional
funding for commitments and contingencies and
unexpected collateral calls, among other things,
the result of which could be increased costs, a
liquidity shortfall and/or impact on our
liquidity coverage ratio.
Our liquidity and cost of obtaining funding is
directly related to prevailing market conditions,
including changes in interest and currency
exchange rates, fluctuations in equity and
futures prices, lower trading volumes and prices
of securitized products and our credit spreads.
Credit spreads are the amount in excess of the
interest rate of U.S. Treasury securities, or
other benchmark securities, of a similar maturity
that we need to pay to our funding providers.
Increases in interest rates and our credit
spreads can increase the cost of our funding and
result in mark-to-market or credit valuation
adjustment exposures. Changes in our credit
spreads are market-driven and may be influenced
by market perceptions of our creditworthiness.
Changes to interest rates and our credit spreads
occur continuously and may be unpredictable and
highly volatile. We may also experience spread
compression as a result of offering higher than
expected deposit rates in order to attract and
maintain deposits due to increased marketplace
rate competition. Additionally, concentrations
within our funding profile, such as maturities,
currencies or counterparties, can reduce our
funding efficiency.
Reduction in our credit ratings could
significantly limit our access to funding or the
capital markets, increase borrowing costs or
trigger additional collateral or funding
requirements.
Our borrowing costs and ability to raise funds
are directly impacted by our credit ratings. In
addition, credit ratings may be important to
customers or counterparties when we compete in
certain markets and seek to engage in certain
transactions, including OTC derivatives. Credit
ratings and outlooks are opinions expressed by
rating agencies on our creditworthiness and that
of our obligations or securities, including long-
term debt, short-term borrowings, preferred stock
and asset securitizations. Our credit ratings are
subject to ongoing review by rating agencies,
which consider a number of factors, including our
financial strength, performance, prospects and
operations and factors not under our control,
such as the macroeconomic and geopolitical
environment, including the macroeconomic stress
caused by the pandemic.
Rating agencies could make adjustments to our
credit ratings at any time, and there can be no
assurance as to when and whether downgrades will
occur. A reduction in certain of our credit
ratings could result in a wider credit spread and
negatively affect our liquidity, access to credit
markets, the related cost of funds, our
businesses and certain trading revenues,
particularly in those businesses where
counterparty creditworthiness is critical. If the
short-term credit ratings of our parent company,
or bank or broker-dealer subsidiaries, were
downgraded by one or more levels, we may suffer
the potential loss of access to short-term
funding sources such as repo financing, and/or
incur increased cost of funds and increased
collateral requirements. Under the terms of
certain OTC derivative contracts and other
trading agreements, if our or our subsidiaries’
credit ratings are downgraded, the counterparties
may require additional collateral or terminate
these contracts or agreements.
 9Bank of America 
While certain potential impacts are contractual
and quantifiable, the full consequences of a
credit rating downgrade to a financial
institution are inherently uncertain, as they
depend upon numerous dynamic, complex and inter-
related factors and assumptions, including
whether any downgrade of a firm’s long-term
credit ratings precipitates downgrades to its
short-term credit ratings, and assumptions about
the potential behaviors of various customers,
investors and counterparties.
Bank of America Corporation is a holding company,
is dependent on its subsidiaries for liquidity
and may be restricted from transferring funds
from subsidiaries.
Bank of America Corporation, as the parent
company, is a separate and distinct legal entity
from our bank and nonbank subsidiaries. We
evaluate and manage liquidity on a legal entity
basis. Legal entity liquidity is an important
consideration as there are legal, regulatory,
contractual and other limitations on our ability
to utilize liquidity from one legal entity to
satisfy the liquidity requirements of another,
including the parent company, which could result
in adverse liquidity events. The parent company
depends on dividends, distributions, loans and
other payments from our bank and nonbank
subsidiaries to fund dividend payments on our
common stock and preferred stock and to fund all
payments on our other obligations, including debt
obligations. Any inability of our subsidiaries to
pay dividends or make payments to us may
adversely affect our cash flow and financial
condition.
Many of our subsidiaries, including our bank and
broker-dealer subsidiaries, are subject to laws
that restrict dividend payments, or authorize
regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of
funds from those subsidiaries to the parent
company or other subsidiaries. Our bank and
broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to
restrictions on their ability to lend or transact
with affiliates and to minimum regulatory capital
and liquidity requirements, as well as
restrictions on their ability to use funds
deposited with them in bank or brokerage accounts
to fund their businesses. Intercompany
arrangements we entered into in connection with
our resolution planning submissions could
restrict the amount of funding available to the
parent company from our subsidiaries under
certain adverse conditions.
Additional restrictions on related party
transactions, increased capital and liquidity
requirements and additional limitations on the
use of funds on deposit in bank or brokerage
accounts, as well as lower earnings, can reduce
the amount of funds available to meet the
obligations of the parent company and even
require the parent company to provide additional
funding to such subsidiaries. Also, regulatory
action that requires additional liquidity at each
of our subsidiaries could impede access to funds
we need to pay our obligations or pay dividends.
In addition, our right to participate in a
distribution of assets upon a subsidiary’s
liquidation or reorganization is subject to prior
claims of the subsidiary’s creditors.
Our liquidity and financial condition, and the
ability to pay dividends to shareholders and to
pay obligations could be materially adversely
affected in the event of a resolution.
Bank of America Corporation, our parent holding
company, is required to periodically submit a
plan to the FDIC and Federal Reserve describing
its resolution strategy under the U.S. Bankruptcy
Code in the event of material financial distress
or failure. In the current plan, Bank of America
Corporation’s preferred resolution strategy is a
“single point of entry” strategy. This strategy
provides that only the parent holding company
files for resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy
Code and contemplates providing certain key
operating subsidiaries with sufficient capital
and liquidity to operate through severe stress
and to enable such subsidiaries to continue
operating or be wound
down in a solvent manner following a bankruptcy
of the parent holding company. Bank of America
Corporation has entered into intercompany
arrangements resulting in the contribution of
most of its capital and liquidity to key
subsidiaries. Pursuant to these arrangements, if
Bank of America Corporation’s liquidity resources
deteriorate so severely that resolution becomes
imminent, Bank of America Corporation will no
longer be able to draw liquidity from its key
subsidiaries, and will be required to contribute
its remaining financial assets to a wholly-owned
holding company subsidiary, which could
materially and adversely affect our liquidity and
financial condition and the ability to return
capital to shareholders, including through the
payment of dividends and repurchase of the
Corporation’s common stock, and meet our payment
obligations.
If the FDIC and Federal Reserve jointly determine
that Bank of America Corporation’s resolution
plan is not credible, they could impose more
stringent capital, leverage or liquidity
requirements or restrictions on our growth,
activities or operations. We could also be
required to take certain actions that could
impose operating costs and could potentially
result in the divestiture or restructuring of
businesses and subsidiaries.
Additionally, under the Financial Reform Act,
when a G-SIB such as Bank of America Corporation
is in default or danger of default, the FDIC may
be appointed receiver in order to conduct an
orderly liquidation of such institution. In the
event of such appointment, the FDIC could, among
other things, invoke the orderly liquidation
authority, instead of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code,
if the Secretary of the Treasury makes certain
financial distress and systemic risk
determinations. In 2013, the FDIC issued a notice
describing its preferred “single point of entry”
strategy for resolving a G-SIB. Under this
approach, the FDIC could replace Bank of America
Corporation with a bridge holding company, which
could continue operations and result in an
orderly resolution of the underlying bank, but
whose equity would be held solely for the benefit
of our creditors. The FDIC’s “single point of
entry” strategy may result in our security
holders suffering greater losses than would have
been the case under a bankruptcy proceeding or a
different resolution strategy.
Credit
Economic or market disruptions and insufficient
credit loss reserves may result in a higher
provision for credit losses.
A number of our products expose us to credit
risk, including loans, letters of credit,
derivatives, debt securities, trading account
assets and assets held-for-sale. Deterioration in
the financial condition of our consumer and
commercial borrowers, counterparties or
underlying collateral could adversely affect our
financial condition and results of operations.
Our credit portfolios may be impacted by global
and U.S. macroeconomic and market conditions,
events and disruptions, including sustained
weakness in GDP, consumer-spending declines,
property value declines or asset-price
corrections, increasing consumer and corporate
leverage, increases in corporate bond spreads,
rising or elevated unemployment levels,
fluctuations in foreign exchange or interest
rates, widespread health emergencies or
pandemics, extreme weather events and the impacts
of climate change and domestic and global efforts
to transition to a low-carbon economy.
Significant economic or market stresses and
disruptions typically have a negative impact on
the business environment and financial markets.
Property value declines or asset-price
corrections could increase the risk of borrowers
or counterparties defaulting or becoming
delinquent in their obligations to us, which
could increase credit losses. Simultaneous
drawdowns on lines of credit and/or an increase
in a borrower’s leverage in a
 Bank of America10 
weakening economic environment could result in
deterioration in our credit portfolio, should
borrowers be unable to fulfill competing
financial obligations. Credit portfolio
deterioration could also be magnified by lending
to leveraged borrowers, elevated asset prices or
declining property or collateral values unrelated
to macroeconomic stress. Increased delinquency
and default rates could adversely affect our
consumer credit card, home equity and residential
mortgage portfolios through increased charge-offs
and provision for credit losses.
Beginning in the first quarter of 2020, the
pandemic resulted in changes to consumer and
business behaviors and restrictions on economic
activity, which have negatively impacted the
global economy and could continue to negatively
impact our consumer and commercial credit
portfolios. Accordingly, we increased our
allowance for credit losses as a result of the
expected macroeconomic impact of COVID-19, which
has adversely affected our results of operations.
Although the economy, including GDP, and
unemployment have improved since the first half
of 2020, certain sectors remain significantly
impacted (e.g., hospitality, entertainment and
travel). As COVID-19 cases have surged in the
fourth quarter of 2020 and early 2021, compared
to earlier levels, and restrictions on economic
activity have been reintroduced in certain
geographies, there remains significant
uncertainty on what the ultimate impact the
pandemic will have on the economy and our
allowance for credit losses.
We establish an allowance for credit losses,
which includes the allowance for loan and lease
losses and the reserve for unfunded lending
commitments, based on management's best estimate
of lifetime expected credit losses inherent in
the Corporation's relevant financial assets. The
process to determine the allowance requires us to
make difficult and complex judgments, including
forecasting how borrowers will perform in
changing and unprecedented economic conditions
and predicting developments in public health and
fiscal policy related to the pandemic. The
ability of our borrowers or counterparties to
repay their obligations will likely be impacted
by changes in future economic conditions, which
in turn could impact the accuracy of our loss
forecasts and allowance estimates. There is also
the possibility that we have failed or will fail
to accurately identify the appropriate economic
indicators or accurately estimate their impacts
to our borrowers, which similarly could impact
the accuracy of our loss forecasts and allowance
estimates.
We may suffer unexpected losses if the models and
assumptions we use to establish reserves or the
judgments we make in extending credit to our
borrowers or counterparties, which are more
sensitive due to the uncertainty regarding the
magnitude and duration of the pandemic and
related macroeconomic impact, prove inaccurate in
predicting future events. In addition, changes to
external factors can negatively impact our
recognition of credit losses in our portfolios
and allowance for credit losses.
As of January 1, 2020, we implemented a new
accounting standard to estimate our allowance for
credit losses. Although we believe that the
allowance for credit losses is in compliance with
the new accounting standard, there is no
guarantee that it will be sufficient to address
credit losses, particularly if the economic
outlook deteriorates significantly. In such an
event, we may increase our allowance which would
reduce our earnings. Additionally, to the extent
that economic conditions worsen as a result of
COVID-19 or otherwise, impacting our consumer and
commercial borrowers, counterparties or
underlying collateral, and credit losses are
worse than expected, we may further increase our
provision for credit losses, which
could have a further adverse effect on our
results of operations and could negatively impact
our financial condition.
Our concentrations of credit risk could adversely
affect our credit losses, results of operations
and financial condition.
In the ordinary course of our business, we may be
subject to concentrations of credit risk because
of a common characteristic or common sensitivity
to economic, financial, public health or business
developments. For example, concentrations in
credit risk may result in a particular industry,
geography, product, asset class, counterparty,
individual exposure or within any pool of
exposures with a common risk characteristic. A
deterioration in the financial condition or
prospects of a particular industry, geographic
location, product or asset class, or a failure or
downgrade of, or default by, any particular
entity or group of entities could negatively
affect our businesses, and it is possible our
limits and credit monitoring exposure controls
will not function as anticipated.
While our activities expose us to many different
industries and counterparties, we routinely
execute a high volume of transactions with
counterparties in the financial services
industry, including broker-dealers, commercial
banks, investment banks, insurers, mutual funds
and hedge funds, central counterparties and other
institutional clients, resulting in significant
credit concentration with respect to this
industry. Financial services institutions and
other counterparties are inter-related because of
trading, funding, clearing or other
relationships. As a result, defaults by one or
more counterparties, or market uncertainty about
the financial stability of one or more financial
services institutions, or the financial services
industry generally, could lead to market-wide
liquidity disruptions, losses and defaults.
Many of these transactions expose us to credit
risk and, in some cases, disputes and litigation
in the event of default of a counterparty. In
addition, our credit risk may be heightened by
market risk when the collateral held by us cannot
be liquidated or is liquidated at prices not
sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan
or derivatives exposure due to us, which may
occur as a result of fraud or other events that
impact the value of the collateral. Further,
disputes with obligors as to the valuation of
collateral could increase in times of significant
market stress, volatility or illiquidity, and we
could suffer losses during such periods if we are
unable to realize the fair value of the
collateral or manage declines in the value of
collateral.
Our commercial portfolios include exposures to
certain industries, including asset managers and
funds, real estate, capital goods and finance
companies. Economic weaknesses, adverse business
conditions, market disruptions, rising interest
or capitalization rates, the collapse of
speculative bubbles, greater volatility in areas
where we have concentrated credit risk or
deterioration in real estate values or household
incomes may cause us to experience a decrease in
cash flow and higher credit losses in either our
consumer or commercial portfolios or cause us to
write down the value of certain assets.
Additionally, we could experience continued and
long-term negative impact to our commercial
credit exposure and an increase in credit losses
within those industries that continue to be
disproportionately impacted by COVID-19 or are
permanently impacted by a change in consumer
preferences resulting from COVID-19 (including
hospitality, entertainment and travel).
Furthermore, we have concentrations of credit
risk with respect to our consumer real estate,
auto, consumer credit card and commercial real
estate portfolios, which represent a significant
percentage of our overall credit portfolio.
Decreases in home price valuations or commercial
real estate valuations in certain markets where
we have large concentrations, as well as
 11Bank of America 
more broadly within the U.S. or globally, could
result in increased defaults, delinquencies or
credit loss. In particular, the impact of climate
change, such as rising average global
temperatures and rising sea levels, and the
increasing frequency and severity of extreme
weather events and natural disasters such as
droughts, floods, wildfires and hurricanes could
negatively impact collateral, the valuations of
home prices or commercial real estate or our
customers’ ability and/or willingness to pay
outstanding loans. This could also cause
insurability risk and/or increased insurance
costs to customers.
We also enter into transactions with sovereign
nations, U.S. states and municipalities.
Unfavorable economic or political conditions,
disruptions to capital markets, currency
fluctuations, changes in oil prices, social
instability and changes in government or monetary
policies could adversely impact the operating
budgets or credit ratings of these government
entities and expose us to credit risk.
Liquidity disruptions in the financial markets
may result in our inability to sell, syndicate or
realize the value of our positions, leading to
increased concentrations, which could increase
the credit and market risk associated with our
positions, as well as increase our RWA.
We may be adversely affected if the U.S. housing
market weakens or home prices decline.
U.S. home prices continued to generally remain
stable or increase in 2020, supported by single-
family housing demand and low interest rates.
However, changes in business and household
behaviors and restrictions on activity in
response to the pandemic have had a negative
impact on some property markets, particularly in
high-density urban areas. We remain conscious of
geographic markets where housing price growth has
slowed or decreased, or is vulnerable to lasting
shifts in demand due to the pandemic, as further
declines in future periods may negatively impact
the demand for many of our products.
Additionally, our mortgage loan production volume
is generally influenced by the rate of growth in
residential mortgage debt outstanding and the
size of the residential mortgage market, both of
which may be adversely affected by rising
interest rates. Conditions in the U.S. housing
market during the 2008 financial crisis resulted
in both significant write-downs of asset values
in several asset classes, notably mortgage-backed
securities, and exposure to monolines. If the
U.S. housing market were to weaken, the value of
real estate could decline, which could result in
increased credit losses and delinquent servicing
expenses and negatively affect our
representations and warranties exposures, and
adversely affect our financial condition and
results of operations.
Our derivatives businesses may expose us to
unexpected risks and potential losses.
We are party to a large number of derivatives
transactions that may expose us to unexpected
market, credit and operational risks that could
cause us to suffer unexpected losses. Severe
declines in asset values, unanticipated credit
events or unforeseen circumstances that may cause
previously uncorrelated factors to become
correlated and vice versa, may create losses
resulting from risks not appropriately taken into
account or anticipated in the development,
structuring or pricing of a derivative
instrument. Certain OTC derivative contracts and
other trading agreements provide that upon the
occurrence of certain specified events, such as a
change in the credit rating of the Corporation or
one or more of its affiliates, we may be required
to provide additional collateral or take other
remedial actions and could experience increased
difficulty obtaining funding or hedging risks. In
some cases our counterparties may have the right
to terminate or otherwise diminish our rights
under these contracts or agreements.
We are also a member of various central
counterparties (CCPs), in part due to regulatory
requirements for mandatory clearing of derivative
transactions, which potentially increases our
credit risk exposures to CCPs. In the event that
one or more members of the CCP defaults on its
obligations, we may be required to pay a portion
of any losses incurred by the CCP as a result of
that default. A CCP may modify, in its
discretion, the margin we are required to post,
which could mean unexpected and increased
exposure to the CCP. As a clearing member, we are
exposed to the risk of non-performance by our
clients for which we clear transactions, which
may not be covered by available collateral.
Additionally, default by a significant market
participant may result in further risk and
potential losses.
 Geopolitical 
We are subject to numerous political, economic,
market, reputational, operational, legal,
regulatory and other risks in the jurisdictions
in which we operate.
We do business throughout the world, including in
emerging markets. Economic or geopolitical stress
in one or more countries could have a negative
impact regionally or globally, resulting in,
among other things, market volatility, reduced
market value and economic output. Our businesses
and revenues derived from non-U.S. jurisdictions
are subject to risk of loss from currency
fluctuations, financial, social or judicial
instability, changes in government leadership,
including as a result of electoral outcomes or
otherwise, changes in governmental policies or
policies of central banks, expropriation,
nationalization and/or confiscation of assets,
price controls, high inflation, natural
disasters, the emergence of widespread health
emergencies or pandemics, capital controls,
currency redenomination risk, exchange controls,
unfavorable political and diplomatic
developments, oil price fluctuations and changes
in legislation. These risks are especially
elevated in emerging markets. Additionally,
protectionist trade policies and continued trade
tensions between the U.S. and important trading
partners, particularly China and the EU,
including the risk that tariffs continue to rise
and other restrictive actions on cross-border
trade, investment, and transfer of information
technology are taken that weigh heavily on
regional trade volumes and domestic demand
through falling business sentiment and lower
consumer confidence, could adversely affect our
businesses and revenues, as well as our customers
and counterparties. Elevated tensions between the
U.S. and China also raise the risk that current
or future U.S. sanctions against individuals or
export controls targeting Chinese firms could
prompt retaliatory responses, potentially
impacting our operations and revenue.
Additionally, the realization of any significant
geopolitical events, negative market conditions
and/or change in market dynamics as a result of
the U.K.’s exit from the EU could adversely
impact our businesses. The short- and long-term
impact of the U.K.’s exit from the EU on European
and global macroeconomic conditions, our business
operations and results of operations remain
unknown.
A number of non-U.S. jurisdictions in which we do
business have been or may be negatively impacted
by slowing growth or recessionary conditions,
market volatility and/or political or civil
unrest. The ongoing pandemic has had a severe
negative impact on global GDP, and the global
economic environment remains challenging even as
output has begun to improve. Economic weakness
may prove persistent in many countries and
regions, including Europe, Japan, and numerous
emerging markets. Potential risks of default on
or devaluation of sovereign debt in some non-U.S.
jurisdictions could expose us to substantial
losses. As a result of the pandemic and fiscal
policy responses
 Bank of America12 
to it, government debt levels have increased
significantly, raising the risk of volatility,
significant valuation changes, or default in
markets for sovereign debt. Risks in one nation
can limit our opportunities for portfolio growth
and negatively affect our operations in other
nations, including our U.S. operations. Market
and economic disruptions of all types may affect
consumer confidence levels and spending,
corporate investment and job creation, bankruptcy
rates, levels of incurrence and default on
consumer and corporate debt, economic growth
rates and asset values, among other factors. Any
such unfavorable conditions or developments could
adversely impact us.
We also invest or trade in the securities of
corporations and governments located in non-U.S.
jurisdictions, including emerging markets.
Revenues from the trading of non-U.S. securities
may be subject to negative fluctuations as a
result of the above factors. Furthermore, the
impact of these fluctuations could be magnified
because non-U.S. trading markets, particularly in
emerging markets, are generally smaller, less
liquid and more volatile than U.S. trading
markets.
Our non-U.S. businesses are also subject to
extensive regulation by governments, securities
exchanges and regulators, central banks and other
regulatory bodies. In many countries, the laws
and regulations applicable to the financial
services and securities industries are uncertain
and evolving, and it may be difficult for us to
determine the exact requirements of local laws in
every market or manage our relationships with
multiple regulators in various jurisdictions. Our
potential inability to remain in compliance with
local laws in a particular market and manage our
relationships with regulators could result in
increased expenses and changes to our
organizational structure and adversely affect our
businesses and results of operations in that
market, as well as our reputation in general.
In connection with the U.K.’s exit from the EU,
we are now subject to different laws, regulations
and regulatory authorities and increased
organizational and operational complexity. We may
incur additional costs and/or experience negative
tax consequences as a result of operating our
principal EU banking and broker-dealer operations
outside of the U.K., which could adversely impact
our EU business, results of operations and
operational model. Further, changes to the legal
and regulatory framework under which our
subsidiaries provide products and services in the
U.K. and in the EU may result in additional
compliance costs and have negative tax
consequences or an adverse impact on our results
of operations.
In addition to non-U.S. legislation, our
international operations are also subject to U.S.
legal requirements, which subjects us to
operational and compliance costs and risks. For
example, our operations are subject to U.S. and
non-U.S. laws and regulations relating to bribery
and corruption, anti-money laundering, and
economic sanctions, which can vary by
jurisdiction. The increasing speed and novel ways
in which funds circulate could make it more
challenging to track the movement of funds and
heightens financial crimes risk. Our ability to
comply with these legal requirements depends on
our ability to continually improve surveillance,
detection and reporting and analytic
capabilities.
In the U.S., debt ceiling and budget deficit
concerns, which have increased the possibility of
U.S. government defaults on its debt and/or
downgrades to its credit ratings, and prolonged
government shutdowns could negatively impact the
global economy and banking system and adversely
affect our financial condition, including our
liquidity. Additionally, changes in fiscal,
monetary or regulatory policy, including as a
result of the change in the U.S. presidential
administration and Congress, could increase our
compliance costs and adversely affect our
business operations, organizational structure and
results of operations. We are also subject to
geopolitical risks, including economic sanctions,
acts or threats of international or domestic
terrorism, actions taken by the U.S. or other
governments in response thereto, state-sponsored
cyber attacks or campaigns, civil unrest and/or
military conflicts, which could adversely affect
business and economic conditions abroad and in
the U.S.
 Business Operations 
A failure in or breach of our operational or
security systems or infrastructure or business
continuity plans, or those of third parties or
the financial services industry, could disrupt
our critical business operations and customer
services, result in regulatory, market, privacy,
liquidity and operational risk exposures, and
adversely impact our results of operations and
financial condition, and cause legal or
reputational harm.
The potential for operational risk exposure
exists throughout our organization and as a
result of our interactions with, and reliance on,
third parties (including their downstream service
providers) and the financial services industry
infrastructure. Our operational and security
systems infrastructure, including our computer
systems, emerging technologies, data management
and internal processes, as well as those of third
parties, are integral to our performance. We also
rely on our employees and third parties
(including downstream service providers) in our
day-to-day and ongoing operations, who may, as a
result of human error, misconduct (including
fraudulent activity), malfeasance or a failure or
breach of systems or infrastructure cause
disruptions to our organization and expose us to
operational and regulatory risk.
Additionally, our financial, accounting, data
processing and transmission, storage, backup or
other operating or security systems and
infrastructure, or those of third parties with
whom we interact or upon whom we rely may fail to
operate properly or become disabled or damaged as
a result of a number of factors including events
that are wholly or partially beyond our or such
third party’s control, which could adversely
affect our ability to process transactions or
provide services. We could also experience
prolonged computer and network outages resulting
in disruptions to our critical business
operations and customer services, including abuse
or failure of our electronic trading and
algorithmic platforms. We may experience sudden
increases in customer transaction volume or
electrical, telecommunications or other major
physical infrastructure outages, newly identified
vulnerabilities in key hardware or software,
failure of aging infrastructure and technology
project implementation challenges, which could
result in prolonged operational outages. Climate
change is increasing the frequency and severity
of natural disasters, such as earthquakes,
wildfires, tornadoes, hurricanes and floods,
which could result in increased exposure to
operational risks, including outages.
Additionally, events arising from local or larger
scale political or social matters, including
civil unrest and terrorist acts, could result in
operational disruptions and prolonged operational
outages.
Additionally, the Corporation and the third
parties on which it relies have been and will
likely continue to be subject to additional
operational risks while operating in a work-from-
home posture (which places greater reliance on
remote access tools and technology and employees’
personal systems), while executing business
continuity plans due to COVID-19. We are
increasingly dependent upon our information
technology infrastructure to operate our
businesses remotely due to our work-from-home
posture and evolving customer preferences,
including increased reliance on digital banking
and other digital
 13Bank of America 
services provided by our businesses. Effective
management of our work-from-home posture depends
on the security, reliability and adequacy of such
systems. We are also at greater risk of business
disruptions due to illness and unavailability.
Regardless of the measures we have taken to
implement training, procedures, backup systems
and other safeguards to support our operations
and bolster our operational resilience, our
ability to conduct business may be adversely
affected by any significant disruptions to us or
to third parties (including their downstream
service providers) with whom we interact or upon
whom we rely, including systemic cyber events
that result in system outages and unavailability
of part or all of the financial services industry
infrastructure. Our ability to implement backup
systems and other safeguards with respect to
third-party systems and the financial services
industry infrastructure is more limited than with
respect to our own systems.
Furthermore, to the extent that backup systems
are available and utilized, they may not process
data as quickly as our primary systems and some
data might not have been backed up. We regularly
update the systems on which we rely to support
our operations and growth and to remain compliant
with all applicable laws, rules and regulations
globally. This updating entails significant costs
and creates risks associated with implementing
new systems and integrating them with existing
ones, including business interruptions. A failure
or breach of our operational or security systems
or infrastructure or business continuity plans
resulting in disruption to our critical business
operations and customer services could expose us
to regulatory, market, privacy and liquidity
risk, and adversely impact our results of
operations and financial condition, as well as
cause legal or reputational harm.
A cyber attack, information or security breach,
or a technology failure of ours or of a third
party could adversely affect our ability to
conduct our business, manage our exposure to risk
or expand our businesses, result in the
disclosure or misuse of confidential or
proprietary information, and/or fraudulent
activity, and increase our costs to maintain and
update our operational and security systems and
infrastructure.
Our business is highly dependent on the security,
controls and efficacy of our infrastructure,
computer and data management systems, as well as
those of our customers, suppliers, counterparties
and other third parties (including their
downstream service providers) the financial
services industry and financial data aggregators,
with whom we interact, on whom we rely or who
have access to our customers' personal or account
information. Our business relies on effective
access management and the secure collection,
processing, transmission, storage and retrieval
of confidential, proprietary, personal and other
information in our computer and data management
systems and networks, and in the computer and
data management systems and networks of third
parties. In addition, to access our network,
products and services, our employees, customers,
suppliers, counterparties and other third parties
increasingly use personal mobile devices or
computing devices that are outside of our network
and control environments and are subject to their
own cybersecurity risks.
We, our employees and customers, regulators and
other third parties (including contractors and
vendors) are regularly the target of cyber
attacks and are likely to continue to be the
target of cyber attacks. These cyber attacks are
pervasive, sophisticated, evolving, difficult to
prevent and include computer viruses, malicious
or destructive code (such as ransomware), social
engineering (including phishing, vishing and
smithing), denial of service or information or
other security breach tactics that could result
in the unauthorized release, gathering,
monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction or theft
of confidential, proprietary and other
information, including intellectual property, of
ours, our employees, our customers or of third
parties. These cyber attacks could also result in
damages to systems, financial risk or otherwise
material disruption to our or our customers’ or
other third parties’ network access or business
operations, both domestically and
internationally.
Our cybersecurity risk and exposure remains
heightened because of, among other things, the
evolving nature and pervasiveness of cyber
threats, our prominent size and scale, our
geographic footprint and international presence
and our role in the financial services industry
and the broader economy. Additionally, our risk
and exposure to cyber attacks and security
breaches is magnified due to our work-from-home
posture which places greater reliance on remote
access tools and technology, resulting in a
larger number of access points to our networks
that must be secured. This increased risk of
unauthorized access to our networks results in
greater amounts of information being available
for access from employees’ personal devices over
which we do not have the same controls as we do
in a non-work-from-home posture. Additionally,
our customers’ increasing reliance on digital
banking and other digital services provided by
our businesses in response to COVID-19, has
resulted in more demand on our information
technology infrastructure and security tools and
processes.
The financial services industry is particularly
at risk because of the proliferation of new and
emerging technologies, including third-party
financial data aggregators, and the use of the
internet and telecommunications technologies to
conduct financial transactions. Additionally, our
use of automation, artificial intelligence (AI)
and robotics, increased use of internet and
mobile banking products, including mobile payment
and other web- and cloud-based products and
applications and plans to use or develop
additional remote connectivity solutions increase
our cybersecurity risks and exposure.
Additionally, we have exposure to cyber threats
as a result of our continuous transmission of
sensitive information to, and storage of such
information by, third parties, including our
vendors and regulators, the outsourcing of some
of our business operations, and system and
customer account updates and conversions.
Cybersecurity risks have also significantly
increased in recent years in part due to the
increasingly sophisticated activities of
organized crime groups, hackers, terrorist
organizations, extremist parties, hostile foreign
governments and state-sponsored actors, in some
instances acting to promote political ends. We
could also be the target of disgruntled employees
or vendors, activists and other parties,
including those involved in corporate espionage.
Cyber threats and the techniques used in cyber
attacks change rapidly and frequently. Despite
substantial efforts to protect the integrity and
resilience of our systems and implement controls,
processes, policies and other protective
measures, we may not be able to anticipate cyber
attacks or information or security breaches and
implement effective preventive or defensive
measures to address or mitigate such attacks or
breaches. Even the most advanced internal control
environment is vulnerable to compromise. Internal
access management failures could result in the
compromise or unauthorized exposure of
confidential data.
Cyber attacks or security breaches could persist
for an extended period of time before being
detected. It could take considerable additional
time for us to determine the scope, extent,
amount, and type of information compromised, at
which time the impact on the Corporation and
measures to recover and restore to a business-as-
usual state may be difficult to
 Bank of America14 
assess. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we
may be required to expend significant additional
resources to modify or enhance our protective
measures, investigate and remediate any
information security vulnerabilities or incidents
and develop our capabilities to respond and
recover. As a result, increasing resources to
develop and enhance our controls, processes and
practices designed to protect our systems,
workstations, intellectual property and
proprietary information, software, data and
networks from attack, damage or unauthorized
access, remains a critical priority.
We also face indirect technology, cybersecurity
and operational risks relating to the customers,
clients and other third parties (including their
downstream service providers) and the financial
services industry, with whom we do business, upon
whom we rely to facilitate or enable our business
activities or upon whom our customers rely. Such
third parties also include financial
counterparties, financial data aggregators,
financial intermediaries, such as clearing
agents, exchanges and clearing houses, vendors,
regulators, providers of critical infrastructure,
such as internet access and electrical power, and
retailers for whom we process transactions. As a
result of increasing consolidation,
interdependence and complexity of financial
entities and technology systems, a technology
failure, cyber attack or other information or
security breach that significantly degrades,
deletes or compromises the systems or data of one
or more financial entities or third parties (or
their downstream service providers) could have a
material impact on counterparties or other market
participants, including us. Similarly, any
failure, cyber attack or other information or
security breach that significantly degrades,
deletes or compromises our systems or data could
adversely impact third parties, counterparties
and the financial services industry
infrastructure, which in turn could harm our
reputation and damage our business. This
consolidation, interconnectivity and complexity
increases the risk of operational failure, on
both individual and industry-wide bases, as
disparate systems need to be integrated, often on
an accelerated basis. Any technology failure,
cyber attack or other information or security
breach, termination or constraint of any third
party (including their downstream service
providers) the financial services industry
infrastructure or financial data aggregators,
could, among other things, adversely affect our
ability to conduct day-to-day business
activities, effect transactions, service our
clients, manage our exposure to risk or expand
our businesses, result in the misappropriation or
destruction of the personal, proprietary or
confidential information of our employees,
customers, suppliers, counterparties and other
third parties or result in fraudulent or
unauthorized transactions. Further, any such
event may not be disclosed to us in a timely
manner.
Although to date we have not experienced any
material losses or other material consequences
relating to technology failure, cyber attacks or
other information or security breaches, whether
directed at us or third parties, there can be no
assurance that our controls and procedures in
place to monitor and mitigate the risks of cyber
threats will be sufficient and that we will not
suffer material losses or consequences in the
future. Cyber attacks or other information or
security breaches, whether directed at us or
third parties, may result in significant lost
revenue, give rise to losses and claims brought
by third parties, government penalties and other
negative consequences. Furthermore, the public
perception that a cyber attack on our systems has
been successful, whether or not this perception
is correct, may damage our reputation with
customers and third parties with whom we do
business. Although we maintain cyber insurance,
there can be no assurance that liabilities or
losses
we may incur will be covered under such policies
or that the amount of insurance will be adequate.
Also, successful penetration or circumvention of
system security could result in negative
consequences, including loss of customers and
business opportunities, the withdrawal of
customer deposits, prolonged computer and network
outages resulting in disruptions to our critical
business operations and customer services,
misappropriation or destruction of our
intellectual property, proprietary information or
confidential information and/or the confidential,
proprietary or personal information of certain
parties, such as our employees, customers,
suppliers, counterparties and other third
parties, or damage to their computers or systems.
This could result in a violation of applicable
privacy and other laws in the U.S. and abroad,
litigation exposure, regulatory fines, penalties
or intervention, loss of confidence in our
security measures, reputational damage,
reimbursement or other compensatory costs,
additional compliance costs, and our internal
controls or disclosure controls being rendered
ineffective. The occurrence of any of these
events could adversely impact our results of
operations, liquidity and financial condition.
Failure to satisfy our obligations as servicer
for residential mortgage securitizations, loans
owned by other entities and other losses we could
incur as servicer, could adversely impact our
reputation, servicing costs or results of
operations.
We and our legacy companies service mortgage
loans on behalf of third-party securitization
vehicles and other investors. If we commit a
material breach of our obligations as servicer or
master servicer, we may be subject to termination
if the breach is not cured within a specified
period of time following notice, which could
cause us to lose servicing income. In addition,
we may have liability for any failure by us, as a
servicer or master servicer, for any act or
omission on our part that involves willful
misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or
reckless disregard of our duties. If any such
breach was found to have occurred, it may harm
our reputation, increase our servicing costs,
result in litigation or regulatory action or
adversely impact our results of operations.
Additionally, with respect to foreclosures, we
may incur costs or losses due to irregularities
in the underlying documentation, or if the
validity of a foreclosure action is challenged by
a borrower or overturned by a court because of
errors or deficiencies in the foreclosure
process. We may also incur costs or losses
relating to delays or alleged deficiencies in
processing documents necessary to comply with
state law governing foreclosure.
Changes in the structure of and relationship
among the GSEs could adversely impact our
business.
During 2020, we sold approximately $3.6 billion
of loans to GSEs, primarily Freddie Mac (FHLMC).
FHLMC and Fannie Mae (FNMA) are currently in
conservatorship with their primary regulator, the
Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) acting as
conservator. In September 2019, the Treasury
Department published a proposal to recapitalize
FHLMC and FNMA and remove them from
conservatorship as well as reduce their role in
the marketplace. Consistent with this proposal,
in January 2021, the Treasury Department further
amended the agreement that governs the
conservatorship of FHLMC and FNMA to allow them
to retain their earnings until they reach certain
previously determined capital requirements, among
other policy actions, potentially putting them on
a long-term path to emergence from
conservatorship. However, we cannot predict the
future prospects of the GSEs, timing of the
recapitalization or release from conservatorship,
or content of legislative or rulemaking proposals
regarding the future status of the GSEs in the
housing market. Additionally, if the GSEs were to
take a reduced role in
 15Bank of America 
the marketplace, including by limiting the
mortgage products they offer, we could be
required to seek alternative funding sources,
retain additional loans on our balance sheet,
secure funding through the Federal Home Loan Bank
system, or securitize the loans through Private
Label Securitization. Accordingly, uncertainty
regarding their future and the mortgage-backed
securities they guarantee continues to exist for
the foreseeable future.
Any of these developments could adversely affect
the value of our securities portfolios, capital
levels, liquidity and results of operations.
Our risk management framework may not be
effective in mitigating risk and reducing the
potential for losses.
Our risk management framework is designed to
minimize risk and loss to us. We seek to
effectively and consistently identify, measure,
monitor, report and control the types of risk to
which we are subject, including strategic,
credit, market, liquidity, compliance,
operational and reputational risks. While we
employ a broad and diversified set of controls
and risk mitigation techniques, including
modeling and forecasting, hedging strategies and
techniques that seek to balance our ability to
profit from trading positions with our exposure
to potential losses, our ability to control and
mitigate risks that result in losses is
inherently limited by our ability to identify all
risks, including emerging and unknown risks,
anticipate the timing of risks, apply effective
hedging strategies, make correct assumptions,
manage and aggregate data correctly and
efficiently, and develop risk management models
to assess and control risk.
Our ability to manage risk is dependent on our
ability to consistently execute all elements of
our risk management program and develop and
maintain a culture of managing risk well
throughout the Corporation and manage risks
associated with third parties (including their
downstream service providers) and vendors, to
enable effective risk management and ensure that
risks are appropriately considered, evaluated and
responded to in a timely manner. Uncertain
economic conditions, heightened legislative and
regulatory scrutiny of and change within the
financial services industry, the pace of
technological changes, accounting and market
developments, the failure of employees to comply
with policies, values and our risk framework and
the overall complexity of our operations, among
other developments, may result in a heightened
level of risk for us. We have experienced
increased operational, reputational and
compliance risk as a result of the need to
rapidly implement multiple and varying pandemic
relief programs, including consumer and
commercial assistance programs and the PPP,
coupled with the concurrent transition of the
Corporation’s workforce to a work-from-home
posture. Accordingly, we could suffer losses as a
result of our failure to manage evolving risks or
properly anticipate, manage, control or mitigate
risks.
 Regulatory, Compliance and Legal 
We are subject to comprehensive government
legislation and regulations and certain
settlements, orders and agreements with
government authorities from time to time.
We are subject to comprehensive regulation under
federal and state laws in the U.S. and the laws
of the various jurisdictions in which we operate,
including increasing and complex economic
sanctions regimes. These laws and regulations
significantly affect and have the potential to
restrict the scope of our existing businesses,
limit our ability to pursue certain business
opportunities, including the products and
services we offer, reduce certain fees and rates
or make our products and services more expensive
for our clients.
We continue to make adjustments to our business
and operations, legal entity structure and
capital and liquidity management policies,
procedures and controls to comply with currently
effective laws and regulations, as well as final
rulemaking, guidance and interpretation by
regulatory authorities, including the Department
of Treasury, Federal Reserve, OCC, CFPB,
Financial Stability Oversight Council, FDIC,
Department of Labor, SEC and CFTC in the U.S. and
foreign regulators and other government
authorities. Further, we could become subject to
future legislation and regulatory requirements
beyond those currently proposed, adopted or
contemplated in the U.S. or abroad, including
policies and rulemaking related to the Financial
Reform Act, the pandemic and climate change. The
cumulative effect of all of the legislation and
regulations on our business, operations and
profitability remains uncertain. This uncertainty
necessitates that in our business planning we
make certain assumptions with respect to the
scope and requirements of prospective and
proposed rules. If these assumptions prove
incorrect, we could be subject to increased
regulatory and compliance risks and costs as well
as potential reputational harm. In addition, U.S.
and international regulatory initiatives may
overlap, and non-U.S. regulations and initiatives
may be inconsistent or may conflict with current
or proposed U.S. regulations, which could lead to
compliance risks and increased costs.
Our regulators’ prudential and supervisory
authority gives them broad power and discretion
to direct our actions, and they have assumed an
active oversight, inspection and investigatory
role across the financial services industry.
However, regulatory focus is not limited to laws
and regulations applicable to the financial
services industry, but extends to other
significant laws and regulations that apply
across industries and jurisdictions, including
those related to data management and privacy,
anti-money laundering, anti-corruption and
economic sanctions.
We are also subject to laws, rules and
regulations in the U.S. and abroad, including
GDPR, CCPA and CPRA, regarding compliance with
our privacy policies and the disclosure,
collection, use, sharing and safeguarding of
personal identifiable information of certain
parties, such as our employees, customers,
suppliers, counterparties and other third
parties, the violation of which could result in
litigation, regulatory fines and enforcement
actions. Additionally, we will likely be subject
to new and evolving data privacy laws in the U.S.
and abroad, which could result in additional
costs of compliance, litigation, regulatory fines
and enforcement actions. In particular, there is
increased complexity and uncertainty, including
potential suspension or prohibition, regarding
the standards used by the Corporation for cross-
border flows and transfers of personal data from
the European Economic Area (EEA) to the U.S. and
other jurisdictions outside of the EEA resulting
from a decision of the Court of Justice of the EU
and guidance from the European Data Protection
Board. Additionally, the European Commission has
proposed new standards of personal data transfer.
If our personal data transfers are suspended or
prohibited or we are required to implement new
standards, this could result in operational
disruptions to our businesses, additional costs,
increased enforcement activity, new contract
negotiations with third parties, and/or
modification of our cross-border data management.
As part of their enforcement authority, our
regulators and other government authorities have
the authority to, among other things, assess
significant civil or criminal monetary penalties
or restitution and issue cease and desist or
removal orders and
 Bank of America16 
initiate injunctive actions. The amounts paid by
us and other financial institutions to settle
proceedings or investigations have, in some
instances, been substantial and may increase. In
some cases, governmental authorities have
required criminal pleas or other extraordinary
terms as part of such resolutions, which could
have significant consequences, including
reputational harm, loss of customers,
restrictions on the ability to access capital
markets, and the inability to operate certain
businesses or offer certain products for a period
of time.
The Corporation and the conduct of its employees
and representatives are subject to regulatory
scrutiny across jurisdictions. The complexity of
the federal and state regulatory and enforcement
regimes in the U.S., coupled with the global
scope of our operations and the regulatory
environment worldwide also means that a single
event or practice or a series of related events
or practices may give rise to a significant
number of overlapping investigations and
regulatory proceedings, either by multiple
federal and state agencies in the U.S. or by
multiple regulators and other governmental
entities in different jurisdictions.
Additionally, actions by other members of the
financial services industry related to business
activities in which we participate may result in
investigations by regulators or other government
authorities. Responding to inquiries,
investigations, lawsuits and proceedings is time-
consuming and expensive and can divert senior
management attention from our business. The
outcome of such proceedings, which may last a
number of years, may be difficult to predict or
estimate.
We are and may become subject to the terms of
settlements, orders and agreements that we have
entered into with government entities and
regulatory authorities, which impose, or could
impose, significant operational and compliance
costs on us as they typically require us to
enhance our procedures and controls, expand our
risk and control functions within our lines of
business, invest in technology and hire
significant numbers of additional risk, control
and compliance personnel. Moreover, if we fail to
meet the requirements of the regulatory
settlements, orders or agreements to which we are
subject, or, more generally, fail to maintain
risk and control procedures and processes that
meet the heightened standards established by our
regulators and other government authorities, we
could be required to enter into further
settlements, orders or agreements and pay
additional fines, penalties or judgments, or
accept material regulatory restrictions on our
businesses.
While we believe that we have adopted appropriate
risk management and compliance programs to
identify, assess, monitor and report on
applicable laws, policies and procedures,
compliance risks will continue to exist,
particularly as we adapt to new and evolving
laws, rules and regulations. Additionally,
changing U.S. fiscal, monetary and regulatory
policies arising from changes to the U.S.
presidential administration and Congress result
in ongoing regulatory uncertainties. There is no
guarantee that our risk management and compliance
programs will be consistently executed to
successfully manage compliance risk. We also rely
upon third parties who may expose us to
compliance and legal risk. Future legislative or
regulatory actions, and any required changes to
our business or operations, or those of third
parties (including their downstream providers)
upon whom we rely, resulting from such
developments and actions could result in a
significant loss of revenue, impose additional
compliance and other costs or otherwise reduce
our profitability, limit the products and
services that we offer or our ability to pursue
certain business opportunities, require us to
dispose of or curtail certain businesses, affect
the value of assets that we hold, require us to
increase our prices and therefore reduce demand
for our
products, or otherwise adversely affect our
businesses. In addition, legal and regulatory
proceedings and other contingencies will arise
from time to time that may result in fines,
regulatory sanctions, penalties, equitable relief
and changes to our business practices. As a
result, we are and will continue to be subject to
heightened compliance and operating costs that
could adversely affect our results of operations.
We are subject to significant financial and
reputational risks from potential liability
arising from lawsuits and regulatory and
government action.
We continue to face significant legal risks in
our business, with a high volume of claims
against us and other financial institutions. The
damages, penalties and fines that litigants and
regulators seek from us and other financial
institutions continue to be high. This includes
disputes with consumers, customers and other
counterparties.
Financial institutions, including us, continue to
be the subject of claims alleging anti-
competitive conduct with respect to various
products and markets, including U.S. antitrust
class actions claiming joint and several
liability for treble damages. As disclosed in
Note 12 — Commitments and Contingencies to the
Consolidated Financial Statements, we also face
contractual indemnification and loan-repurchase
claims arising from alleged breaches of
representations and warranties in the sale of
residential mortgages by legacy companies, which
may result in a requirement that we repurchase
the mortgage loans, or otherwise make whole or
provide other remedies to counterparties.
In addition, regulatory authorities have had a
supervisory focus on enforcement, including in
connection with alleged violations of law and
customer harm. For example, U.S. regulators and
government agencies have pursued claims against
financial institutions under the Financial
Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement
Act, False Claims Act, Equal Credit Opportunity
Act, Fair Housing Act and antitrust laws. Such
claims may carry significant and, in certain
cases, treble damages. T here is also an
increased focus on compliance with global laws,
rules and regulations related to the collection,
use, sharing and safeguarding of personally
identifiable information and corporate data.
Additionally, misconduct by employees, including
unethical, fraudulent, improper or illegal
conduct, or other unfair, deceptive, abusive or
discriminatory business practices, can result in
litigation and/or government investigations and
enforcement actions, and cause significant
reputational harm.
The global environment of extensive regulation,
regulatory compliance burdens, litigation and
regulatory enforcement, combined with uncertainty
related to the continually evolving regulatory
environment, may affect operational and
compliance costs and risks, which may limit or
cease our ability to continue providing certain
products and services. This is magnified by the
Corporation's implementation of government relief
measures related to the pandemic. Lawsuits and
regulatory actions may result in judgments,
settlements, penalties and fines adverse to the
Corporation. Litigation and investigation costs,
substantial legal liability or significant
regulatory or government action against us could
have adverse effects on our business, financial
condition, including liquidity, and results of
operations, and/or cause significant reputational
harm to us.
U.S. federal banking agencies may require us to
increase our regulatory capital, total loss-
absorbing capacity (TLAC), long-term debt or
liquidity requirements.
We are subject to U.S. regulatory capital and
liquidity rules. These rules, among other things,
establish minimum requirements to qualify as a
well-capitalized institution. If any of
 17Bank of America 
our subsidiary insured depository institutions
fails to maintain its status as well capitalized
under the applicable regulatory capital rules,
the Federal Reserve will require us to agree to
bring the insured depository institution back to
well-capitalized status. For the duration of such
an agreement, the Federal Reserve may impose
restrictions on our activities. If we were to
fail to enter into or comply with such an
agreement, or fail to comply with the terms of
such agreement, the Federal Reserve may impose
more severe restrictions on our activities,
including requiring us to cease and desist
activities permitted under the Bank Holding
Company Act of 1956.
Capital and liquidity requirements are frequently
introduced and amended. It is possible that
regulators may increase regulatory capital
requirements including TLAC and long-term debt
requirements, change how regulatory capital is
calculated or increase liquidity requirements.
Our ability to return capital to our shareholders
depends in part on our ability to maintain
regulatory capital levels above minimum
requirements plus buffers. To the extent that
increases occur in our SCB, G-SIB surcharge or
countercyclical capital buffer, our returns of
capital to shareholders could decrease.
As part of its CCAR, the Federal Reserve conducts
stress testing on parts of our business using
hypothetical economic scenarios prepared by the
Federal Reserve. Those scenarios may affect our
CCAR stress test results, which may impact the
level of our SCB. Additionally, the Federal
Reserve may impose limitations or prohibitions on
taking capital actions, such as paying or
increasing dividends or repurchasing common
stock. For example, as a result of the economic
uncertainty resulting from the pandemic, the
Federal Reserve applied certain restrictions on
our common stock dividends and repurchase program
during the second half of 2020, and the first
quarter of 2021, as disclosed in Item 1. Business
– Distributions on page 5 and MD&A – Executive
Summary – Recent Developments – Capital
Management on page 25.
A significant component of regulatory capital
ratios is calculating our RWA and our leverage
exposure, which may increase. The Basel Committee
on Banking Supervision has also revised several
key methodologies for measuring RWA that have not
yet been implemented in the U.S., including a
standardized approach for operational risk,
revised market risk requirements and constraints
on the use of internal models, as well as a
capital floor based on the revised standardized
approaches. U.S. banking regulators may update
the U.S. Basel 3 rules to incorporate the Basel
Committee revisions.
Changes to and compliance with the regulatory
capital and liquidity requirements may impact our
operations by requiring us to liquidate assets,
increase borrowings, issue additional equity or
other securities, cease or alter certain
operations or hold highly liquid assets, which
may adversely affect our results of operations.
Changes in accounting standards or assumptions in
applying accounting policies could adversely
affect us.
Our accounting policies and methods are
fundamental to how we record and report our
financial condition and results of operations.
Some of these policies require use of estimates
and assumptions that may affect the reported
value of our assets or liabilities and results of
operations and are critical because they require
management to make difficult, subjective and
complex judgments about matters that are
inherently uncertain. If those assumptions,
estimates or judgments were incorrectly made, we
could be required to correct and restate prior-
period financial statements. Accounting standard-
setters and those who interpret the accounting
standards, the SEC, banking regulators and our
independent registered public accounting firm may
also
amend or even reverse their previous
interpretations or positions on how various
standards should be applied. These changes may be
difficult to predict and could impact how we
prepare and report our financial statements. In
some cases, we could be required to apply a new
or revised standard retrospectively, resulting in
us revising prior-period financial statements.
We may be adversely affected by changes in U.S.
and non-U.S. tax laws and regulations.
In December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the
Tax Act) was enacted, which made significant
changes to federal income tax law including,
among other things, reducing the statutory
corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35
percent and changing the taxation of our non-U.S.
business activities.
In addition, we have U.K. net deferred tax assets
(DTA) which consist primarily of net operating
losses that are expected to be realized by
certain subsidiaries over an extended number of
years. Adverse developments with respect to tax
laws or to other material factors, such as
prolonged worsening of Europe’s capital markets
or changes in the ability of our U.K.
subsidiaries to conduct business in the EU, could
lead our management to reassess and/or change its
current conclusion that no valuation allowance is
necessary with respect to our U.K. net DTA.
It is possible that governmental authorities in
the U.S. and/or other countries could further
amend or repeal tax laws in a way that would
adversely affect us, including the possibility
that aspects of the Tax Act could be amended in
the future. Any future change in tax laws and
regulations or interpretations of current or
future tax laws and regulations could adversely
affect our results of operations.
 Reputation 
Damage to our reputation could harm our
businesses, including our competitive position
and business prospects.
Our ability to attract and retain customers,
clients, investors and employees is impacted by
our reputation. Harm to our reputation can arise
from various sources, including officer, director
or employee fraud, misconduct and unethical
behavior, security breaches, litigation or
regulatory outcomes, compensation practices,
lending practices, the suitability or
reasonableness of recommending particular trading
or investment strategies, including the
reliability of our research and models,
prohibiting clients from engaging in certain
transactions and employee sales practices.
Additionally, our reputation may be harmed by
failing to deliver products, subpar standards of
service and quality expected by our customers,
clients and the community, compliance failures,
the inability to manage technology change or
maintain effective data management, cyber
incidents, internal and external fraud,
inadequacy of responsiveness to internal
controls, unintended disclosure of personal,
proprietary or confidential information,
conflicts of interest and breach of fiduciary
obligations, the handling of health emergencies
or pandemics, and the activities of our clients,
customers, counterparties and third parties,
including vendors. For example, our reputation
may be harmed in connection with our
implementation of government programs to provide
relief to address the economic impact of the
pandemic. Our reputation may also be negatively
impacted by our ESG practices and disclosures,
our businesses and our customers, including
practices and disclosures related to climate
change. Actions by the financial services
industry generally or by certain members or
individuals in the industry also can adversely
affect our reputation. In addition, adverse
publicity or negative information posted on
social media by employees, the media or
otherwise, whether or not factually
 Bank of America18 
correct, may adversely impact our business
prospects or financial results.
We are subject to complex and evolving laws and
regulations regarding privacy, know-your-customer
requirements, data protection, including the
GDPR, CCPA and CPRA, cross-border data movement
and other matters. Principles concerning the
appropriate scope of consumer and commercial
privacy vary considerably in different
jurisdictions, and regulatory and public
expectations regarding the definition and scope
of consumer and commercial privacy may remain
fluid. It is possible that these laws may be
interpreted and applied by various jurisdictions
in a manner inconsistent with our current or
future practices, or that is inconsistent with
one another. If personal, confidential or
proprietary information of customers or clients
in our possession, or in the possession of third
parties (including their downstream service
providers) or financial data aggregators, is
mishandled, misused or mismanaged, or if we do
not timely or adequately address such
information, we may face regulatory, reputational
and operational risks which could adversely
affect our financial condition and results of
operations.
We could suffer reputational harm if we fail to
properly identify and manage potential conflicts
of interest. Management of potential conflicts of
interest has become increasingly complex as we
expand our business activities through more
numerous transactions, obligations and interests
with and among our clients. The failure to
adequately address, or the perceived failure to
adequately address, conflicts of interest could
affect the willingness of clients to use our
products and services, or give rise to litigation
or enforcement actions, which could adversely
affect our business.
Our actual or perceived failure to address these
and other issues, such as operational risks,
gives rise to reputational risk that could harm
us and our business prospects. Failure to
appropriately address any of these issues could
also give rise to additional regulatory
restrictions, legal risks and reputational harm,
which could, among other consequences, increase
the size and number of litigation claims and
damages asserted or subject us to enforcement
actions, fines and penalties, and cause us to
incur related costs and expenses.
 Other 
Reforms to and replacement of IBORs and certain
other rates or indices may adversely affect our
reputation, business, financial condition and
results of operations.
There is a major transition in progress in global
financial markets with respect to the replacement
of IBORs, including the London Interbank Offered
Rate (LIBOR), and certain other rates or indices
that serve as “benchmarks.” Such benchmarks are
used extensively across global financial markets
and in our business. In particular, LIBOR is used
in many of our products and contracts, including
derivatives, consumer and commercial loans,
mortgages, floating-rate notes and other
adjustable-rate products and financial
instruments. The aggregate notional amount of
these products and contracts is material to our
business, and there are significant risks and
challenges associated with the transition that
may result in significant uncertainty, or have
other consequences that cannot be fully
anticipated, which expose us to various
financial, operational, supervisory, conduct and
legal risks.
Although certain ARRs have been proposed to
replace LIBOR and other IBORs, market and client
adoption of ARRs may vary across or within
categories of contracts, products and services,
resulting in market fragmentation, decreased
trading volumes and liquidity, increased
complexity and modeling and
operational risks. ARRs have compositions and
characteristics that differ significantly from
the benchmarks they may replace, in some cases
have limited history, and may demonstrate less
predictable performance over time than the
benchmarks they replace. Additionally, most ARRs
are calculated on a compounded or weighted-
average basis, involve complex billing and
reconciliation and, unlike IBORs, do not reflect
bank credit risk and therefore may require a
spread adjustment. The market transition from
IBORs to ARRs is complex and there are important
differences between the fallbacks, triggers and
calculation methodologies being implemented in
cash and derivatives markets (including within
cash markets). Any mismatch between the adoption
of ARRs in loans, securities and derivatives
markets may impact hedging or other financial
arrangements we have implemented, and as a result
we may experience unanticipated market exposures.
There can be no assurance that ARRs will be
comparable or adequate alternatives to IBORs or
perform in the same way, that existing assets and
liabilities based on or linked to IBORs will
transition successfully to ARRs, of the timing of
adoption and degree of integration and acceptance
of ARRs in the financial markets, or of the
future availability or representativeness of such
ARRs.
The discontinuation of IBORs, including LIBOR,
requires us to transition a significant number of
IBOR-based products and contracts, including
related hedging arrangements (IBOR Products).
Although, a significant majority of the aggregate
notional amount of our LIBOR-based products and
contracts maturing after 2021 include or have
been updated to include fallbacks to ARRs, the
transitioning of certain contracts, products and
clients will be more complex. While some of these
outstanding IBOR Products include fallback
provisions to ARRs, some of these products and
contracts do not include fallback provisions or
adequate fallback mechanisms and require
remediation to modify their terms. Additionally,
some outstanding IBOR Products are particularly
challenging to modify due to the requirement that
all impacted parties consent to such
modification. Legislation has been adopted in the
EU and proposed in the U.S. and the U.K. to
address such challenges in IBOR Products,
including the use of a statutory replacement or
“synthetic” rate to replace the existing
benchmark rate in certain of our IBOR Products.
Litigation, disputes or other action may occur as
a result of the interpretation or application of
legislation, in particular, if there is an
overlap between legislation introduced in
different jurisdictions. There is no guarantee
that the legislative proposals will become law
and no assurance that we and other market
participants will be able to successfully modify
all outstanding IBOR Products or be adequately
prepared for a discontinuation of an IBOR at the
time such IBOR may cease to be published or
otherwise discontinued. Also, there can be no
assurance that existing or new provisions for
successor rates in our IBOR Products will include
adequate methodologies for adjustments or that
the characteristics of the successor rates will
be similar to or produce the economic equivalent
of the benchmarks they seek to replace. These
changes may adversely affect the yield on loans
or securities held by us, amounts paid on
securities we have issued, amounts received and
paid on derivatives we have entered into, the
value of such loans, securities or derivative
instruments, the trading market for such products
and contracts, and our ability to effectively use
hedging instruments to manage risk. Certain
impacted clients, counterparties and other market
participants may refuse, delay, or lack
operational readiness to transition to ARRs,
resulting in the risk that some contracts and
products may not transition to an ARR before
discontinuation of the relevant IBOR, exposing us
to financial, operational, supervisory, conduct
and legal risks.
 19Bank of America 
Our products and contracts that reference IBORs,
in particular LIBOR, may contain language that
determines when a successor rate including the
ARR and/or the applicable spread adjustment to
the designated rate (including IBORs) would be
selected or determined. If a trigger is
satisfied, our products and contracts may give
the calculation agent (which may be us)
discretion over the successor rate to be
selected. We may face a risk of litigation,
disputes or other actions from clients,
counterparties, customers, investors or others
regarding the interpretation or enforcement of
IBOR-based contract provisions or if we fail to
appropriately communicate the effect that the
transition to ARRs will have on existing and
future products.
The Corporation has launched, and expects to
continue to develop, launch and support, ARR-
based products and services. The transition to
ARR-based products is complex and involves client
and financial contract changes, internal and
external communication, technology and operations
modifications, industry and regulatory
engagement, migration of existing clients,
execution of business strategy and governance.
New financial products linked to ARRs may be less
liquid, result in mispricing and additional
legal, financial, tax, operational, market,
compliance, reputational, competitive or other
risks to us, our clients and other market
participants. There is no guarantee that
liquidity in ARR-based products will develop, and
it is possible that ARR-based products will
perform differently to IBOR Products during times
of economic stress, adverse or volatile market
conditions and across the credit and economic
cycle, which may impact the value, return on and
profitability of our ARR-based assets.
Failure to meet industry-wide IBOR transition
milestones and to cease issuance of IBOR Products
by relevant cessation dates may, subject to
certain regulatory exceptions, result in
supervisory enforcement by applicable regulators,
increase our cost of, and access to, capital and
other consequences. In addition, IBOR Products
held by us may become less liquid as the
transition process develops, and other unforeseen
consequences may arise if such products are held
beyond relevant cessation dates.
Changes or uncertainty resulting from the market
transition from IBORs to ARRs could adversely
affect the return on and pricing, liquidity and
value of outstanding IBOR Products, cause
significant market dislocations and disruptions,
potentially increase the cost of and access to
capital, increase the risk of litigation or other
disputes, including in connection with the
interpretation and enforceability of, or our
historical marketing practices or disclosures
with respect to outstanding IBOR products with
counterparties, and/or increase expenses related
to the transition to ARRs, among other adverse
consequences.
The market transition may also alter our risk
profile and risk management strategies, including
derivatives and hedging strategies, modeling and
analytics, valuation tools, product design and
systems, controls, procedures and operational
infrastructure. This may prove challenging given
the limited history of many of the proposed ARRs
and may increase the costs and risks related to
potential regulatory compliance, requirements or
inquiries. Among other risks, various products
and contracts may transition to ARRs at different
times or in different manners, with the result
that we may face significant unexpected interest
rate, pricing or other exposures across business
or product lines. Reforms to and uncertainty
regarding market transition and other factors may
adversely affect our business, including the
ability to serve customers and maintain market
share, financial condition or results of
operations and could result in reputational harm
to the Corporation.
We face significant and increasing competition in
the financial services industry.
We operate in a highly competitive environment
and experience intense competition from local and
global financial institutions as well as new
entrants, in both domestic and foreign markets,
in which we compete on the basis of a number of
factors, including customer service, quality and
range of products and services offered,
technology, price, fees, reputation, interest
rates on loans and deposits, lending limits and
customer convenience. Additionally, the changing
regulatory environment may create competitive
disadvantages for us given geography-driven
capital and liquidity requirements. Additionally,
we may face competitors with more experience and
established relationships in the relevant market,
which could adversely affect our ability to
compete.
In addition, emerging technologies and advances
and the growth of e-commerce have lowered
geographic and monetary barriers of other
financial institutions, made it easier for non-
depository institutions to offer products and
services that traditionally were banking products
and allowed non-traditional financial service
providers and technology companies to compete
with traditional financial service companies in
providing electronic and internet-based financial
solutions and services, including electronic
securities trading with low or no fees and
commissions, marketplace lending, financial data
aggregation and payment processing, including
real-time payment platforms. Further, clients may
choose to conduct business with other market
participants who engage in business or offer
products in areas we deem speculative or risky,
such as cryptocurrencies. Increased competition
may negatively affect our earnings by creating
pressure to lower prices, fees, commissions or
credit standards on our products and services
requiring additional investment to improve the
quality and delivery of our technology and/or
reducing our market share, or affecting the
willingness of our clients to do business with
us.
Our inability to adapt our products and services
could harm our business.
Our business model is based on a diversified mix
of businesses that provide a broad range of
financial products and services, delivered
through multiple distribution channels. Our
success depends on our, and our third-party
vendors', ability to adapt and develop products,
services and technology to rapidly evolving
industry standards and consumer preferences. In
particular, the emergence of the pandemic has
resulted in increased reliance on digital banking
and other digital services provided by the
Corporation’s businesses. There is increasing
pressure by competitors to provide products and
services on more attractive terms, including
higher interest rates on deposits, and offer
lower cost investment strategies, which may
impact our ability to grow revenue and/or
effectively compete. Additionally, legislative
and regulatory developments may affect the
competitive landscape. Further, the competitive
landscape may be impacted by the growth of non-
depository institutions that offer traditional
banking products at higher rates or with low or
no fees, or otherwise offer alternative products.
This can reduce our net interest margin and
revenues from our fee-based products and
services, either from a decrease in the volume of
transactions or through a compression of spreads.
In addition, the widespread adoption and rapid
evolution of new technologies, including analytic
capabilities, self-service digital trading
platforms, internet services, distributed
ledgers, such as the blockchain system,
cryptocurrencies and payment systems, could
require substantial expenditures to modify or
adapt our existing products and services as we
grow and develop our online and mobile banking
channel strategies in
 Bank of America20 
addition to remote connectivity solutions. We may
not be as timely or successful in developing or
introducing new products and services,
integrating new products or services into our
existing offerings, responding or adapting to
changes in consumer behavior, preferences,
spending, investing and/or saving habits,
achieving market acceptance of our products and
services, reducing costs in response to pressures
to deliver products and services at lower prices
or sufficiently developing and maintaining loyal
customers. The Corporation’s or its third-party
vendors' inability to adapt products and services
to evolving industry standards and consumer
preferences could result in service disruptions
and harm our business and adversely affect our
results of operations and reputation.
We could suffer operational, reputational and
financial harm if our models and strategies fail
to properly anticipate and manage risk.
We use proprietary models and strategies
extensively to forecast losses, project revenue,
measure and assess capital requirements for
credit, country, market, operational and
strategic risks and assess and control our
operations and financial condition. Model risk
management is a dedicated and independent risk
function that defines model risk governance,
policy and guidelines for the Corporation based
on laws, rules and regulations, as well as
internal requirements. Under the Corporation's
Enterprise Model Risk Policy, model risk
management is required to perform model
oversight, including independent validation
before initial use, ongoing monitoring through
outcomes analysis and benchmarking, and periodic
revalidation. Models are subject to inherent
limitations due to the use of historical trends
and simplifying assumptions, uncertainty
regarding economic and financial outcomes, and
emerging risks from the use of applications that
rely on AI.
Our models and strategies may not be sufficiently
predictive of future results due to limited
historical patterns, extreme or unanticipated
market movements or customer behavior and
liquidity, especially during severe market
downturns or stress events, which could limit
their effectiveness. The models that we use to
assess and control our market risk exposures also
reflect assumptions about the degree of
correlation among prices of various asset classes
or other market indicators, which may not be
representative of the next downturn and would
magnify the limitations inherent in using
historical data to manage risk. Our models may
not be effective if we fail to properly oversee
them and detect their flaws during our review and
monitoring processes, they contain erroneous
data, assumptions, valuations, formulas or
algorithms or our applications running the models
do not perform as expected. Regardless of the
steps we take to ensure effective controls,
governance, monitoring and testing, and implement
new
technology and automated processes, we could
suffer operational, reputational and financial
harm if models and strategies fail to properly
anticipate and manage current and evolving risks.
Failure to properly manage and aggregate data may
result in our inability to manage risk and
business needs, errors in our day-to-day
operations, critical reporting and strategic
decision-making and inaccurate reporting.
We rely on our ability to manage, surveil,
aggregate, interpret and use data in an accurate,
timely and complete manner for effective risk
reporting and management. Our policies, programs,
processes and practices govern how data is
surveilled, managed, aggregated, interpreted and
used. While we continuously update our policies,
programs, processes and practices and implement
emerging technologies, such as
automation, AI and robotics, our data management
and aggregation processes are subject to failure,
including human error, system failure or failed
controls. Failure to surveil, maintain and manage
data and information effectively and to aggregate
data and information in an accurate, timely and
complete manner may impact its quality and
reliability and limit our ability to manage
current and emerging risk, to produce accurate
financial, regulatory and operational reporting,
as well as to manage changing business needs,
strategic decision-making and day-to-day
operations. The failure to establish and maintain
effective, efficient and controlled data
management could adversely impact our ability to
develop our products and relationships with our
customers and damage our reputation.
Our operations, businesses and customers could be
materially adversely affected by the impacts
related to climate change.
There is an increasing concern over the risks of
climate change and related environmental
sustainability matters. The physical risks of
climate change include rising average global
temperatures, rising sea levels and an increase
in the frequency and severity of extreme weather
events and natural disasters, including floods,
wildfires, hurricanes and tornados. Such
disasters could disrupt our operations or the
operations of customers or third parties on which
we rely. Such disasters could result in market
volatility or negatively impact our customers’
ability to pay outstanding loans, damage
collateral or result in the deterioration of the
value of collateral or insurance shortfalls.
Additionally, climate change concerns could
result in transition risk. Changes in consumer
preferences and additional legislation and
regulatory requirements, including those
associated with the transition to a low-carbon
economy, could increase expenses or otherwise
adversely impact the Corporation, its businesses
or its customers. We could also experience
increased expenses resulting from strategic
planning, litigation and technology and market
changes, and reputational harm as a result of
negative public sentiment, regulatory scrutiny
and reduced investor and stakeholder confidence
due to our response to climate change and our
climate change strategy.
Our ability to attract and retain qualified
employees is critical to our success, business
prospects and competitive position.
Our performance is heavily dependent on the
talents and efforts of highly skilled
individuals. Competition for qualified personnel
within the financial services industry and from
businesses outside the financial services
industry is intense.
Our competitors include non-U.S. based
institutions and institutions subject to
different compensation and hiring regulations
than those imposed on U.S. institutions and
financial institutions.
In order to attract and retain qualified
personnel, we must provide market-level
compensation. As a large financial and banking
institution, we are and may become subject to
additional limitations on compensation practices,
which may or may not affect our competitors, by
the Federal Reserve, the OCC, the FDIC and other
regulators around the world. EU and U.K. rules
limit and subject to clawback certain forms of
variable
compensation for senior employees. Furthermore, a
substantial portion of our annual incentive
compensation paid to our senior employees
consists of long-term equity-based awards, the
value of which is based on the price of our
common stock when the awards vest. Our business
prospects and competitive position could be
adversely affected if we cannot attract and
retain qualified individuals.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations
Bank of America Corporation (the “Corporation”)
and its management may make certain statements
that constitute “forward-looking statements”
within the meaning of the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements
can be identified by the fact that they do not
relate strictly to historical or current facts.
Forward-looking statements often use words such
as “anticipates,” “targets,” “expects,” “hopes,”
“estimates,” “intends,” “plans,” “goals,”
“believes,” “continue” and other similar
expressions or future or conditional verbs such
as “will,” “may,” “might,” “should,” “would” and
“could.” Forward-looking statements represent the
Corporation’s current expectations, plans or
forecasts of its future results, revenues,
provision for credit losses, expenses, efficiency
ratio, capital measures, strategy and future
business and economic conditions more generally,
and other future matters. These statements are
not guarantees of future results or performance
and involve certain known and unknown risks,
uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult
to predict and are often beyond the Corporation’s
control. Actual outcomes and results may differ
materially from those expressed in, or implied
by, any of these forward-looking statements.

servicing their sovereign debt, and related
stresses on financial markets, currencies and
trade, and the Corporation’s exposures to such
risks, including direct, indirect and
operational; the impact of U.S. and global
interest rates, inflation, currency exchange
rates, economic conditions, trade policies and
tensions, including tariffs, and potential
geopolitical instability; the impact of the
interest rate environment on the Corporation’s
business, financial condition and results of
operations; the possibility that future credit
losses may be higher than currently expected due
to changes in economic assumptions, customer
behavior, adverse developments with respect to
U.S. or global economic conditions and other
uncertainties; the Corporation's concentration of
credit risk; the Corporation’s ability to achieve
its expense targets and expectations regarding
revenue, net interest income, provision for
credit losses, net charge-offs, effective tax
rate, loan growth or other projections; adverse
changes to the Corporation’s credit ratings from
the major credit rating agencies; an inability to
access capital markets or maintain deposits or
borrowing costs; estimates of the fair value and
other accounting values, subject to impairment
assessments, of certain of the Corporation’s
assets
and liabilities; the estimated or actual impact
of changes in accounting standards or assumptions
in applying those standards; uncertainty
regarding the content, timing and impact of
regulatory capital and liquidity requirements;
the impact of adverse changes to total loss-
absorbing capacity requirements, stress capital
buffer requirements and/or global systemically
important bank surcharges; the potential impact
of actions of the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System on the Corporation’s
capital plans; the effect of regulations, other
guidance or additional information on the impact
from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act; the impact of
implementation and compliance with U.S. and
international laws, regulations and regulatory
interpretations, including, but not limited to,
recovery and resolution planning requirements,
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
assessments, the Volcker Rule, fiduciary
standards, derivatives regulations and the
Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security

regulations; a failure or disruption in or breach
of the Corporation’s operational or security
systems or infrastructure, or those of third
parties, including as a result of cyber attacks
or campaigns; the impact on the Corporation’s
business, financial condition and results of
operations from the United Kingdom's exit from
the European Union; the impact of climate change;
the impact of any future federal government
shutdown and uncertainty regarding the federal
government’s debt limit or changes to the U.S.
presidential administration and Congress; the
emergence of widespread health emergencies or
pandemics, including the magnitude and duration
of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the
U.S. and/or global, financial market conditions
and our business, results of operations,
financial condition and prospects; the impact of
natural disasters, extreme weather events,
military conflict, terrorism or other
geopolitical events; and other matters.

 Recent Developments 
 Capital Management 
In June 2020, the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve) notified
BHCs of their 2020 Comprehensive Capital Analysis
and Review (CCAR) supervisory stress test
results. Due to economic uncertainty resulting
from the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)
pandemic (the pandemic), the Federal Reserve
required all large banks to update and resubmit
their capital plans in November 2020 based on the
Federal Reserve’s updated supervisory stress test
scenarios. The results of the additional
supervisory stress tests were published in
December 2020.
The Federal Reserve also required large banks to
suspend share repurchase programs during the
second half of 2020, except for repurchases to
offset shares awarded under equity-based
compensation plans, and to limit common stock
dividends to existing rates that did not exceed
the average of the last four quarters’ net
income. In December 2020, the Federal Reserve
announced that beginning in the first quarter of
2021, large banks would be permitted to pay
common stock dividends at existing rates and to
repurchase shares in an amount that, when
combined with dividends paid, does not exceed the
average of net income over the last four
quarters.
On January 19, 2021, we announced that the Board
of Directors (the Board) declared a quarterly
common stock dividend of $0.18 per share, payable
on March 26, 2021 to shareholders of record as of
March 5, 2021. We also announced that the Board
authorized the repurchase of $2.9 billion in
common stock through March 31, 2021, plus
repurchases to offset shares awarded under
equity-based compensation plans during the same
period, estimated to be approximately $300
million. This authorization equals the maximum
amount allowed by the Federal Reserve for the
period. For more information, see Capital
Management on page 50.
 COVID-19 Pandemic 
In the first quarter of 2020, the World Health
Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a
pandemic. In an attempt to contain the spread and
impact of the pandemic, travel bans and
restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place
orders and other limitations on business activity
were implemented. Additionally, there has been a
decline in global economic activity, reduced U.S.
and global economic output and a deterioration in
macroeconomic conditions in the U.S. and
globally. This has
resulted in, among other things, higher rates of
unemployment and underemployment and caused
volatility and disruptions in the global
financial markets, including the energy and
commodity markets. Although vaccines have been
approved for immunization against COVID-19 in
certain countries and restrictive measures have
been eased in certain areas, COVID-19 cases have
significantly increased in recent months in the
U.S. and many regions of the world compared to
earlier levels. Businesses, market participants,
our counterparties and clients, and the U.S. and
global economies have been negatively impacted
and are likely to be so for an extended period of
time, as there remains significant uncertainty
about the timing and strength of an economic
recovery.
To address the economic impact in the U.S., in
March and April 2020, four economic stimulus
packages were enacted to provide relief to
businesses and individuals, including the
Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security
Act (CARES Act). Among other measures, the CARES
Act established the Small Business Administration
(SBA) Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), which
provides loans to small businesses to keep their
employees on payroll and make other eligible
payments. The original funding for the PPP under
the CARES Act was fully allocated by mid-April
2020, with additional funding made available on
April 24, 2020 under the Paycheck Protection
Program and Health Care Enhancement Act. In
December 2020, an additional economic stimulus
package was included as part of the Consolidated
Appropriations Act of 2021 (the Consolidated
Appropriations Act), which provides relief to
individuals and businesses. This relief included
additional funding for the PPP under the Economic
Aid to Hard-Hit Small Businesses, Nonprofits, and
Venues Act (the Economic Aid Act).
In response to the pandemic, the Corporation has
implemented protocols and processes to execute
its business continuity plans and help protect
its employees and support its clients. The
Corporation is managing its response to the
pandemic according to its Enterprise Response
Framework, which invokes centralized management
of the crisis event and the integration of its
response. The CEO and key members of the
Corporation’s management team meet regularly with
co-leaders of the Executive Response Team, which
is composed of senior executives across the
Corporation, to help drive decisions,
communications and consistency of response across
all businesses and functions. We are also
coordinating with global, regional and local
authorities and health experts, including the
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) and the World Health Organization.
Additionally, we have implemented a number of
measures to assist our employees, clients and the
communities we serve as discussed below.
 Employees 
We are providing support to our teammates to help
promote the health and safety of our employees
and help to ensure our protocols remain aligned
to current guidance by monitoring guidance from
the CDC, medical boards and health authorities
and sharing such guidance with our employees. We
are also operating our businesses from remote
locations and leveraging our business continuity
plans and capabilities.
The Corporation has globally implemented a work-
from-home posture, which has resulted in the
substantial majority of our employees working
from home, and pre-planned contingency strategies
for site-based operations for our remaining
employees. We continue to evaluate our continuity
plans and work-from-home strategy in an effort to
best protect the health and safety of our
employees.
 25Bank of America 
 Clients 
We continue to leverage our business continuity
plans and capabilities to service our clients and
meet our clients’ financial needs by offering
assistance to clients affected by the pandemic,
including providing access to credit and the
important financial services on which our clients
rely. We are also participating in the programs
created by the CARES Act and Federal Reserve
lending programs for businesses, including
originating PPP loans. We have also participated
in the Main Street Lending Program, which ended
on January 8, 2021. While most of our deferral
programs expired in the third quarter of 2020, we
continue to offer assistance on a case-by-case
basis when requested by clients affected by the
pandemic.
As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately
332,000 PPP loans outstanding with a carrying
value of $22.7 billion, which were recorded in
the Consumer , GWIM and Global Banking segments.
Since the PPP's inception through February 17,
2021, borrowers have submitted applications for
forgiveness to us for approximately 113,000 PPP
loans with balances totaling $10.9 billion. We
have submitted approximately 72,000 PPP loans
with balances totaling $8.5 billion to the SBA
for repayment, of which we have received to date
$5.4 billion in repayment from the SBA.
Additionally, as of February 17, 2021, we have
originated $4.1 billion in PPP loans under the
Economic Aid Act. For more information on PPP
loans, see Credit Risk Management on page 61, and
for more information on accounting for PPP loans
and loan modifications under the CARES Act, see
Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting
Principles to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.
 Community Partners 
We continue to support the communities where we
live and work by engaging in various initiatives
to help those affected by COVID-19. These
initiatives include committing resources to
provide medical supplies, food and other
necessities for those in need. We are also
supporting racial equality, economic opportunity
and environmental sustainability through direct
equity investments in minority-owned depository
institutions, equity investments in minority
entrepreneurs, businesses and funds, as well as
other initiatives.
 Risk Management 
We continue to manage the increased operational
risk related to the execution of our business
continuity plans in accordance with our
Enterprise Response Framework, Risk Framework and
Operational Risk Management Program. For more
information, see Managing Risk on page 47.
 Loan Modifications 
The Corporation has implemented various consumer
and commercial loan modification programs to
provide its borrowers relief from the economic
impacts of COVID-19. Based on guidance in the
CARES Act that the Corporation adopted, COVID-19
related modifications to consumer and commercial
loans that were current as of December 31, 2019
are exempt from troubled debt restructuring (TDR)
classification under accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of
America (GAAP). In addition, the bank regulatory
agencies issued interagency guidance stating that
COVID-19 related short-term modifications (i.e.,
six months or less) granted to consumer or
commercial loans that were current as of the loan
modification program implementation date are not
TDRs. In December 2020, the Consolidated
Appropriations Act amended the CARES Act by
extending the exemption from TDR classification
for COVID-19 related modifications from December
31, 2020 to the earlier of January 1, 2022 or 60
days after the national emergency has ended. For
more information, see Note
1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles
and Note 5 – Outstanding Loans and Leases and
Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated
Financial Statements .
We have provided borrowers with relief from the
economic impacts of COVID-19 through payment
deferral and forbearance programs. A significant
portion of deferrals expired during the second
half of 2020, reflecting a decline in customer
requests for assistance. As of February 17, 2021,
deferred consumer and small business loans
recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet
totaled $6.8 billion, predominantly consisting of
$6.4 billion of residential mortgage and home
equity loans, including loans serviced by others,
that are well-collateralized.
 Other Related Matters 
Although the macroeconomic outlook improved
modestly during the second half of 2020, the
future direct and indirect impact of COVID-19 on
our businesses, results of operations and
financial condition of the Corporation remains
highly uncertain. Should current economic
conditions persist or deteriorate, this
macroeconomic environment will have a continued
adverse effect on our businesses and results of
operations and could have an adverse effect on
our financial condition. For more information on
how the risks related to the pandemic may
adversely affect our businesses, results of
operations and financial condition, see Part I.
Item 1A. Risk Factors on page 7.
 LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rates 
Following the 2017 announcement by the U.K.’s
Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) that it would
no longer compel participating banks to submit
rates for the London Interbank Offered Rate
(LIBOR) after 2021, regulators, trade
associations and financial industry working
groups have identified recommended replacement
rates for LIBOR, as well as other Interbank
Offered Rates (IBORs), and have published
recommended conventions to allow new and existing
products to incorporate fallbacks or that
reference these Alternative Reference Rates
(ARRs). The continuation of all British Pound
Sterling, Euro, Swiss Franc and Japanese Yen
LIBOR settings and one-week and two-month U.S.
dollar LIBOR settings on the current basis are
expected to terminate at the end of December
2021, and the remaining U.S. dollar LIBOR
settings (i.e., overnight, one month, three
month, six month and 12 month) are expected to
terminate at the end of June 2023.
As a result of this and other announcements,
financial benchmark reforms, regulatory guidance
and changes in short-term interbank lending
markets more generally, a major transition is in
progress in global financial markets with respect
to the replacement of IBORs and certain
benchmarks. The transition of IBORs to ARRs is a
complex process impacting a variety of global
financial markets and our business and
operations.
IBORs are used in many of the Corporation’s
products and contracts, including derivatives,
consumer and commercial loans, mortgages,
floating-rate notes and other adjustable-rate
products and financial instruments. The
discontinuation of IBORs requires us to
transition a significant number of IBOR-based
products and contracts, including related hedging
arrangements. In response, the Corporation
established an enterprise-wide IBOR transition
program led by senior management in early 2018.
This program, which is led by the Corporation's
Chief Operating Officer, includes active
involvement of senior management and regular
reports to the Enterprise Risk Committee (ERC).
The program is intended to address the
Corporation's industry and regulatory engagement,
client and financial contract changes, internal
and external communications, technology and
operations modifications,
 Bank of America26 
introduction of new products, migration of
existing clients, and program strategy and
governance. In addition, the program is designed
to monitor a variety of scenarios, including
operational risks associated with insufficient
preparation by individual market participants or
the overall market ecosystem, volatility along
the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR)
curve, development and adoption of credit-
sensitive and other rates, regulatory and legal
uncertainty with respect to various matters
including contract continuity, access by market
participants to liquidity in certain products,
and IBOR continuity beyond December 2021. As of
February 1, 2021, a significant majority of the
aggregate notional amount of our LIBOR-based
products and contracts maturing after 2021
include or have been updated to include fallbacks
to ARRs based on market driven protocols,
regulatory guidance and industry-recommended
fallback provisions and related mechanisms. For
certain of the remaining products and contracts,
the transition will be more complex, particularly
where there is no industry-wide protocol or
similar mechanism. The Corporation is executing
transition plans that are intended to be in line
with applicable major industry-wide IBOR product
cessation and launch milestones recommended by
the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a
group of private market participants and official
sector entities convened by the Federal Reserve
and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and the
Bank of England Sterling Risk Free Rate Working
Group, other than the cessation of LIBOR-based
adjustable-rate consumer mortgages. The
Corporation plans to no longer offer these
mortgages and launch SOFR-based adjustable-rate
consumer mortgages by the end of the first
quarter of 2021. The Corporation is executing
product and client roadmaps that it believes
align with industry-recommended and regulatory
milestones, and the Corporation has developed
employee training programs as well as other
internal and external sources of information on
the various challenges and opportunities that the
replacement of IBORs presents. As the transition
to ARRs evolves, the Corporation continues to
monitor and participate in the development and
usage of certain ARRs, including SOFR, the Euro
Short Term Rate and the Sterling Overnight Index
Average (SONIA). The Corporation’s key transition
efforts to date include issuances of debt and
deposits linked to SOFR and SONIA by the
Corporation, facilitating debt issuances linked
to ARRs by clients and secondary market liquidity
for products linked to ARRs, originating and
arranging loans linked to ARRs, including hedging
arrangements, executing, trading, market making
and clearing ARR-based derivatives, and launching
capabilities and services to support the issuance
and trading in products indexed to certain ARRs.
The Corporation updated its operational models,
systems, procedures and internal infrastructure
in connection with the transition to ARRs by the
central clearing counterparties. In October 2020,
the Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries
adhered to the International Swaps and
Derivatives Association, Inc. 2020 IBOR Fallbacks
Protocol, effective January 25, 2021, which
provides a mechanism to enable market
participants to incorporate fallbacks for certain
legacy non-cleared derivatives linked to certain
IBORs. Additionally, the Corporation is
continuing to evaluate potential regulatory, tax
and accounting impacts of the transition,
including guidance published and/or proposed by
the Internal Revenue Service and Financial
Accounting Standards Board, engage impacted
clients in connection with the transition to ARRs
and work actively with global regulators,
industry working groups and trade associations to
develop strategies for an effective transition to
ARRs. For more information on the
expected replacement of LIBOR and other benchmark
rates, see Item 1A. Risk Factors – Other on page
19. U.K. Exit from the EU On January 31, 2020,
the U.K. formally exited the European Union (EU),
and a transition period began during which time
the U.K. and the EU negotiated a trade agreement
and other terms associated with their future
relationship. The transition period ended on
December 31, 2020. We conduct business in Europe,
the Middle East and Africa primarily through our
subsidiaries in the U.K., Ireland and France and
implemented changes to enable us to continue to
operate in the region, including establishing a
bank and broker-dealer in the EU, as well as
minimize the potential for any operational
disruption. As the global economic impact of the
U.K.’s withdrawal from the EU remains uncertain
and could result in regional and global financial
market disruptions, we continue to assess
potential operational, regulatory and legal
risks. For more information, see Item 1A. Risk
Factors – Geopolitical on page 12. Financial
Highlights Effective January 1, 2020, we adopted
the new accounting standard on current expected
credit losses (CECL), under which the allowance
is measured based on management’s best estimate
of lifetime expected credit losses (ECL). Prior-
year periods presented reflect measurement of the
allowance based on management’s estimate of
probable incurred credit losses. For more
information, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant
Accounting Principles to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Net income was $17.9 billion or $1.87 per diluted
share in 2020 compared to $27.4 billion or $2.75
per diluted share in 2019. The decline in net
income was primarily due to higher provision for
credit losses driven by the weaker economic
outlook related to COVID-19 and lower net
interest income. For discussion and analysis of
our consolidated and business segment results of
operations for 2019 compared to 2018, see the
Financial Highlights and Business Segment
Operations sections in the MD&A of the
Corporation's 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Net Interest Income Net interest income decreased
$5.5 billion to $43.4 billion in 2020 compared to
2019. Net interest yield on a fully taxable-
equivalent (FTE) basis decreased 53 basis points
(bps) to 1.90 percent for 2020. The decrease in
net interest income was primarily driven by lower
interest rates, partially offset by reduced
deposit and funding costs, the deployment of
excess deposits into securities and an additional
day of interest accrual. Assuming continued
economic improvement and based on the forward
interest rate curve as of January 19, 2021, when
we announced quarterly and annual results for the
periods ended December 31, 2020, we expect net
interest income to be higher in the second half
of 2021 as compared to both the second half of
2020 and the first half of 2021. For more
information on net interest yield and the FTE
basis, see Supplemental Financial Data on page
31, and for more information on interest rate
risk management, see Interest Rate Risk
Management for the Banking Book on page 82.

Noninterest income decreased $185 million to
$42.2 billion in 2020 compared to 2019. The
following highlights the significant changes. ●
Card income decreased $141 million primarily due
to lower levels of consumer spending driven by
the impact of COVID-19, partially offset by
higher income related to the processing of
unemployment insurance. ● Service charges
decreased $533 million primarily due to higher
deposit balances and lower client activity due to
the impact of COVID-19. ● Investment and
brokerage services income increased $672 million
primarily due to higher client transactional
activity, higher market valuations and assets
under management (AUM) flows, partially offset by
declines in AUM pricing.
● Investment banking fees increased $1.5 billion
primarily driven by higher equity issuance fees.
● Market making and similar activities decreased
$679 million primarily due to the impact of lower
U.S. interest rates on certain risk management
derivatives, partially offset by increased client
activity and strong trading performance in fixed
income, currencies and commodities (FICC). ●
Other income decreased $1.0 billion primarily due
to lower equity investment income, higher
partnership losses on tax credit investments,
primarily affordable housing and renewable
energy, partially offset by higher gains on loan
sales and sales of debt securities. Provision for
Credit Losses The provision for credit losses
increased $7.7 billion to $11.3 billion in 2020
compared to 2019 primarily driven by higher ECL
due to a weaker economic outlook related to
COVID-19. For more information on the provision
for credit losses, see Allowance for Credit
Losses on page 76. Noninterest Expense

 Total noninterest expense $ 55,213 $ 54,900 
Noninterest expense increased $313 million to

increase was primarily due to higher operating
costs related to COVID-19, merchant services
expenses, which were previously recorded in other
income as part of joint venture net earnings, and
higher activity-based expenses due to increased
client activity, partially offset by a $2.1
billion pretax impairment charge related to the
notice of termination of the merchant services
joint venture in 2019. Income Tax Expense

compared to $5.3 billion in 2019, resulting in an
effective tax rate of 5.8 percent compared to
16.3 percent.
 Bank of America28 
The change in the effective tax rate for 2020 was
driven by the impact of our recurring tax
preference benefits on lower levels of pretax
income. These benefits primarily consist of tax
credits from environmental, social and governance
(ESG) investments in affordable housing and
renewable energy, aligning with our responsible
growth strategy to address global sustainability
challenges. Excluding tax credits related to our
ESG investment activity, the effective tax rate
for 2020 would have been 21 percent.
The 2020 rate also included the impact of the
U.K. tax law change, whereby on July 22, 2020,
the U.K. enacted a repeal of the final two
percent of scheduled decreases in the U.K.
corporation tax rate, which had been previously
enacted. This change will unfavorably affect
income tax expense on future U.K.
earnings, and requires a reversal of the
adjustment to the U.K. net deferred tax assets
recognized at the time the tax rate decreases
were originally enacted. Accordingly, during the
third quarter of 2020, the Corporation recorded
an income tax benefit of approximately $700
million along with a corresponding increase to
the U.K. net deferred tax assets.
The effective tax rate for 2019 included net tax
benefits primarily related to the resolution of
various tax controversy matters.
Absent unusual items, we expect the effective tax
rate for 2021 to be in the range of 10 – 12
percent, reflecting tax credits related to our
ESG investment activity.

 Assets 
At December 31, 2020, total assets were
approximately $2.8 trillion, up $385.5 billion
from December 31, 2019. The increase in assets
was primarily due to higher cash held at central
banks that was primarily funded by deposit growth
and debt securities, partially offset by a
decline in loans and leases.
 Cash and Cash Equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents increased $218.9
billion driven by deposit growth .
Federal Funds Sold and Securities Borrowed or
Purchased Under Agreements to Resell
Federal funds transactions involve lending
reserve balances on a short-term basis.
Securities borrowed or purchased under agreements
to resell are collateralized lending transactions
utilized to accommodate customer transactions,
earn interest rate spreads, and obtain securities
for settlement and for collateral. Federal funds
sold and securities borrowed or purchased under
agreements to resell increased $29.5 billion
primarily due to deployment of deposit inflows.
 Trading Account Assets 
Trading account assets consist primarily of long
positions in equity and fixed-income securities
including U.S. government and agency securities,
corporate securities and non-U.S. sovereign debt.
Trading account assets decreased $31.0 billion
due to a decline in inventory within Global
Markets .
 Debt Securities 
Debt securities primarily include U.S. Treasury
and agency securities, mortgage-backed securities
(MBS), principally agency MBS, non-U.S. bonds,
corporate bonds and municipal debt. We use the
debt securities portfolio primarily to manage
interest rate and liquidity risk and to take
advantage of market conditions that create
economically attractive returns on these
investments. Debt securities increased $212.7
billion primarily driven by the deployment of
deposit inflows. For more information on debt
securities, see Note 4 – Securities to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.
 29Bank of America 
 Loans and Leases 
Loans and leases decreased $55.6 billion
primarily driven by commercial loan paydowns,
lower credit card spending and lower residential
mortgages due to higher paydowns and a decline in
originations. For more information on the loan
portfolio, see Credit Risk Management on page 61.
 Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses 
The allowance for loan and lease losses increased
$9.4 billion primarily due to the weaker economic
outlook related to COVID-19 and the impact of the
adoption of the new credit loss accounting
standard. For more information, see Allowance for
Credit Losses on page 76.
 Liabilities 
At December 31, 2020, total liabilities were
approximately $2.5 trillion, up $377.4 billion
from December 31, 2019, primarily due to deposit
growth.
 Deposits 
Deposits increased $360.7 billion primarily due
to an increase in retail and wholesale deposits.
Federal Funds Purchased and Securities Loaned or
Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase
Federal funds transactions involve borrowing
reserve balances on a short-term basis.
Securities loaned or sold under agreements to
repurchase are collateralized borrowing
transactions utilized to accommodate customer
transactions, earn interest rate spreads and
finance assets on the balance sheet. Federal
funds purchased and securities loaned or sold
under agreements to repurchase increased $5.2
billion primarily driven by client activity
within Global Markets .
 Trading Account Liabilities 
Trading account liabilities consist primarily of
short positions in equity and fixed-income
securities including U.S. Treasury and agency
securities, corporate securities and non-U.S.
sovereign debt. Trading account liabilities
decreased $12.0 billion primarily due to lower
levels of short positions within Global Markets .
 Short-term Borrowings 
Short-term borrowings provide an additional
funding source and primarily consist of Federal
Home Loan Bank (FHLB) short-term borrowings,
notes payable and various other borrowings that
generally have maturities of one year or less.
Short-term borrowings decreased $4.9 billion due
to higher deposit levels. For more information on
short-term borrowings, see Note 10 – Federal
Funds Sold or Purchased, Securities Financing
Agreements, Short-term Borrowings and Restricted
Cash to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 Long-term Debt 
Long-term debt increased $22.1 billion primarily
due to debt issuances and valuation adjustments,
partially offset by maturities and redemptions.
For more information on long-term debt, see Note
11 – Long-term Debt to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.
 Shareholders’ Equity 
Shareholders’ equity increased $8.1 billion
driven by net income, market value increases on
debt securities and issuances of preferred and
common stock, partially offset by the return of
capital to shareholders totaling $14.7 billion
through share repurchases and common and
preferred stock dividends, as well as the impact
of the adoption of the new credit loss accounting
standard and the redemption of preferred stock.
 Cash Flows Overview 
The Corporation’s operating assets and
liabilities support our global markets and
lending activities. We believe that cash flows
from operations, available cash balances and our
ability to generate cash through short- and long-
term debt are sufficient to fund our operating
liquidity needs. Our investing activities
primarily include the debt securities portfolio

 Supplemental Financial Data 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
In this Form 10-K, we present certain non-GAAP
financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures
exclude certain items or otherwise include
components that differ from the most directly
comparable measures calculated in accordance with
GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures are provided as
additional useful information to assess our
financial condition, results of operations
(including period-to-period operating
performance) or compliance with prospective
regulatory requirements. These non-GAAP financial
measures are not intended as a substitute for
GAAP financial measures and may not be defined or
calculated the same way as non-GAAP financial
measures used by other companies.
We view net interest income and related ratios
and analyses on an FTE basis, which when
presented on a consolidated basis are non-GAAP
financial measures. To derive the FTE basis, net
interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt
income on an equivalent before-tax basis with a
corresponding increase in income tax expense. For
purposes of this calculation, we use the federal
statutory tax rate of 21 percent and a
representative state tax rate. Net interest
yield, which measures the basis points we earn
over the cost of funds, utilizes net interest
income on an FTE basis. We believe that
presentation of these items on an FTE basis
allows for comparison of amounts from both
taxable and tax-exempt sources and is consistent
with industry practices.
We may present certain key performance indicators
and ratios excluding certain items (e.g., debit
valuation adjustment (DVA) gains (losses)) which
result in non-GAAP financial measures. We believe
that the presentation of measures that exclude
these items is useful because such measures
provide additional information to assess the
underlying operational performance and trends of
our businesses and to allow better comparison of
period-to-period operating performance.
We also evaluate our business based on certain
ratios that utilize tangible equity, a non-GAAP
financial measure. Tangible equity represents
shareholders’ equity or common shareholders’
equity reduced by goodwill and intangible assets
(excluding mortgage servicing rights (MSRs)), net
of related deferred tax liabilities ("adjusted"
shareholders' equity or common shareholders'
equity). These measures are used to evaluate our
use of equity. In addition, profitability,
relationship and investment models use both
return on average tangible common shareholders’
equity and return on average tangible
shareholders’ equity as key measures to support
our overall growth objectives. These ratios are
as follows:
● Return on average tangible common shareholders’
equity measures our net income applicable to
common shareholders as a percentage of adjusted
average common shareholders’ equity. The tangible
common equity ratio represents adjusted ending
common shareholders’ equity divided by total
tangible assets.
● Return on average tangible shareholders' equity
measures our net income as a percentage of
adjusted average total shareholders’ equity. The
tangible equity ratio represents adjusted ending
shareholders’ equity divided by total tangible
assets.
● Tangible book value per common share represents
adjusted ending common shareholders’ equity
divided by ending common shares outstanding.
We believe ratios utilizing tangible equity
provide additional useful information because
they present measures of those assets that can
generate income. Tangible book value per common
share provides additional useful information
about the level of tangible assets in relation to
outstanding shares of common stock.
The aforementioned supplemental data and
performance measures are presented in Tables 6
and 7.
For more information on the reconciliation of
these non-GAAP financial measures to the
corresponding GAAP financial measures, see Non-
GAAP Reconciliations on page 88.
 Key Performance Indicators 
We present certain key financial and nonfinancial
performance indicators (key performance
indicators) that management uses when assessing
our consolidated and/or segment results. We
believe they are useful to investors because they
provide additional information about our
underlying operational performance and trends.
These key performance indicators (KPIs) may not
be defined or calculated in the same way as
similar KPIs used by other companies. For
information on how these metrics are defined, see
Key Metrics on page 173.
Our consolidated key performance indicators,
which include various equity and credit metrics,
are presented in Table 1 on page 27 and/or Tables
6 and 7 on pages 32 and 33.
For information on key segment performance
metrics, see Business Segment Operations on page
36.

 Business Segment Operations 
 Segment Description and Basis of Presentation 
We report our results of operations through four
business segments: Consumer Banking, GWIM, Global
Banking and Global Markets , with the remaining
operations recorded in All Other . We manage our
segments and report their results on an FTE
basis. The primary activities, products and
businesses of the business segments and All Other
are shown below.
We periodically review capital allocated to our
businesses and allocate capital annually during
the strategic and capital planning processes. We
utilize a methodology that considers the effect
of regulatory capital requirements in addition to
internal risk-based capital models. Our internal
risk-based capital models use a risk-adjusted
methodology incorporating each segment’s credit,
market, interest rate, business and operational
risk components. For more information on the
nature of these risks, see Managing Risk on page
47. The capital allocated to the business
segments is referred to as allocated capital.
Allocated equity in the reporting units is
comprised of allocated capital plus capital for
the portion of goodwill and intangibles
specifically assigned to the reporting unit. For
more information, including the definition of a
reporting unit, see Note 7 – Goodwill and
Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.
For more information on our presentation of
financial information on an FTE basis, see
Supplemental Financial Data on page 31, and for
reconciliations to consolidated total revenue,
net income and period-end total assets, see Note
23 – Business Segment Information to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.
 Key Performance Indicators 
We present certain key financial and nonfinancial
performance indicators that management uses when
evaluating segment results. We believe they are
useful to investors because they provide
additional information about our segments’
operational performance, customer trends and
business growth.

(1) Estimated at the segment level only.
(2) In segments and businesses where the total of
liabilities and equity exceeds assets, we
allocate assets from All Other to match the
segments’ and businesses’ liabilities and
allocated shareholders’ equity. As a result,
total earning assets and total assets of the
businesses may not equal total Consumer Banking .
Consumer Banking, which is comprised of Deposits
and Consumer Lending, offers a diversified range
of credit, banking and investment products and
services to consumers and small businesses.
Deposits and Consumer Lending include the net
impact of migrating customers and their related
deposit, brokerage asset and loan balances
between Deposits, Consumer Lending and GWIM , as
well as other client-managed businesses. Our
customers and clients have access to a coast to
coast network including financial centers in 38
states and the District of Columbia. Our network
includes approximately 4,300 financial centers,
approximately 17,000 ATMS, nationwide call
centers and leading digital banking platforms
with more than 39 million active users, including
approximately 31 million active mobile users .
Consumer Banking Results .
Net income for Consumer Banking decreased $6.5
billion to $6.5 billion in 2020 compared to 2019
primarily due to lower revenue, higher provision
for credit losses and higher expenses. Net
interest income decreased $3.5 billion to $24.7
billion
primarily due to lower rates, partially offset by
the benefit of higher deposit and loan balances.
Noninterest income decreased $1.9 billion to $8.6
billion driven by a decline in service charges
primarily due to higher deposit balances and
lower card income due to decreased client
activity, as well as lower other income due to
the allocation of asset and liability management
(ALM) results.
The provision for credit losses increased $2.0
billion to $5.8 billion primarily due to the
weaker economic outlook related to COVID-19.
Noninterest expense increased $1.2 billion to
$18.9 billion primarily driven by incremental
expense to support customers and employees during
the pandemic, as well as the cost of increased
client activity and continued investments for
business growth, including the merchant services
platform.
The return on average allocated capital was 17
percent, down from 35 percent, driven by lower
net income and, to a lesser extent, an increase
in allocated capital. For information on capital
allocated to the business segments, see Business
Segment Operations on page 36.
 37Bank of America 
Deposits Deposits includes the results of
consumer deposit activities which consist of a
comprehensive range of products provided to
consumers and small businesses. Our deposit
products include traditional savings accounts,
money market savings accounts, CDs and IRAs, and
noninterest- and interest-bearing checking
accounts, as well as investment accounts and
products. Net interest income is allocated to the
deposit products using our funds transfer pricing
process that matches assets and liabilities with
similar interest rate sensitivity and maturity
characteristics. Deposits generates fees such as
account service fees, non-sufficient funds fees,
overdraft charges and ATM fees, as well as
investment and brokerage fees from Merrill Edge
accounts. Merrill Edge is an integrated investing
and banking service targeted at customers with
less than $250,000 in investable assets. Merrill
Edge provides investment advice and guidance,
client brokerage asset services, a self-directed
online investing platform and key banking
capabilities including access to the
Corporation’s network of financial centers and
ATMs. Net income for Deposits decreased $4.1
billion to $4.2 billion primarily driven by lower
revenue. Net interest income declined $3.2
billion to $13.7 billion primarily due to lower
interest rates, partially offset by the benefit
of growth in deposits. Noninterest income
decreased $1.3 billion to $3.7 billion primarily
driven by lower service charges due to higher
deposit balances and lower client activity
related to the impact of COVID-19, as well as
lower other income due to the allocation of ALM
results. The provision for credit losses
increased $110 million to $379 million in 2020
due to the weaker economic outlook related to
COVID-19. Noninterest expense increased $790
million to $11.5 billion driven by continued
investments in the business and incremental
expense to support customers and employees during
the pandemic. Average deposits increased $114.0
billion to $817.0 billion in 2020 driven by
strong organic growth of $79.3 billion in
checking and time deposits and $34.4 billion in
traditional savings and money market savings.
The following table provides key performance
indicators for Deposits. Management uses these
metrics, and we believe they are useful to
investors because they provide additional
information to evaluate our deposit profitability
and digital/mobile trends.

banking users increased approximately two million
reflecting continuing changes in our customers’
banking preferences. We had a net increase of 12
financial centers as we continued to optimize our
consumer banking network. Consumer Lending
Consumer Lending offers products to consumers and
small businesses across the U.S. The products
offered include credit and debit cards,
residential mortgages and home equity loans, and
direct and indirect loans such as automotive,
recreational vehicle and consumer personal loans.
In addition to earning net interest spread
revenue on its lending activities, Consumer
Lending generates interchange revenue from credit
and debit card transactions, late fees, cash
advance fees, annual credit card fees, mortgage
banking fee income and other miscellaneous fees.
Consumer Lending products are available to our
customers through our retail network, direct
telephone, and online and mobile channels.
Consumer Lending results also include the impact
of servicing residential mortgages and home
equity loans in the core portfolio, including
loans held on the balance sheet of Consumer
Lending and loans serviced for others.
 Bank of America38 
Net income for Consumer Lending was $2.3 billion,
a decrease of $2.4 billion, primarily due to
higher provision for credit losses. Net interest
income declined $295 million to $11.0 billion
primarily due to lower interest rates, partially
offset by loan growth. Noninterest income
decreased $555 million to $4.9 billion primarily
driven by lower card income due to lower client
activity, as well as lower other income due to
the allocation of ALM results. The provision for
credit losses increased $1.9 billion to $5.4
billion primarily due to the weaker economic
outlook related to COVID-19. Noninterest expense
increased $442 million to $7.4 billion primarily
driven by investments in the business and
incremental expense to support customers and
employees during the pandemic. Average loans
increased $14.9 billion to $310.4 billion
primarily driven by an increase in residential
mortgages and PPP loans, partially offset by a
decline in credit cards. The following table
provides key performance indicators for Consumer
Lending. Management uses these metrics, and we
believe they are useful to investors because they
provide additional information about loan growth
and profitability.

lower mix of customer balances at promotional
rates, the lower interest rate environment and
lower net credit losses. Total credit card
purchase volumes declined $26.3 billion to $251.6
billion. The decline in credit card purchase
volumes was driven by the impact of COVID-19.
While overall spending improved during the second

During 2020, debit card purchase volumes
increased $23.8 billion to $384.5 billion,

GWIM consists of two primary businesses: Merrill
Lynch Global Wealth Management (MLGWM) and Bank
of America Private Bank.
MLGWM's advisory business provides a high-touch
client experience through a network of financial
advisors focused on clients with over $250,000 in
total investable assets. MLGWM provides tailored
solutions to meet clients' needs through a full
set of investment management, brokerage, banking
and retirement products.
Bank of America Private Bank, together with
MLGWM's Private Wealth Management business,
provides comprehensive wealth management
solutions targeted to high net worth and ultra
high net worth clients, as well as customized
solutions to meet clients' wealth structuring,
investment management, trust and banking needs,
including specialty asset management services.
Net income for GWIM decreased $1.2 billion to
$3.1 billion primarily due to lower net interest
income, higher noninterest expense and higher
provision for credit losses.
Net interest income decreased $1.0 billion to
$5.5 billion due to the impact of lower interest
rates, partially offset by the benefit of strong
deposit and loan growth.
Noninterest income, which primarily includes
investment and brokerage services income,
increased $82 million to $13.1 billion primarily
due to higher market valuations and positive AUM
flows, largely offset by declines in AUM pricing
as well as lower other income due to the
allocation of ALM results.
The provision for credit losses increased $275
million to $357 million primarily due to the
weaker economic outlook related to COVID-19.
Noninterest expense increased $329 million to
$14.2 billion primarily driven by higher
investments in primary sales professionals and
revenue-related incentives.
The return on average allocated capital was 21
percent, down from 29 percent, due to lower net
income and, to a lesser extent, a small increase
in allocated capital.
Average loans increased $14.5 billion to $183.4
billion primarily driven by residential mortgage
and custom lending. Average deposits increased
$30.6 billion to $287.1 billion primarily driven
by inflows resulting from client responses to
market volatility and lower spending.
MLGWM revenue of $15.3 billion decreased five
percent primarily driven by the impact of lower
interest rates, partially offset by the benefits
of higher market valuations and positive AUM
flows.
Bank of America Private Bank revenue of $3.3
billion decreased four percent primarily driven
by the impact of lower interest rates.

Client Balances
Client balances managed under advisory and/or
discretion of GWIM are AUM and are typically held
in diversified portfolios. Fees earned on AUM are
calculated as a percentage of clients’ AUM
balances. The asset management fees charged to
clients per year depend on various factors, but
are commonly driven by the breadth of the
client’s relationship. The net client AUM flows
represent the net change in clients’ AUM balances
over a specified period of time, excluding market
appreciation/depreciation and other adjustments.
Client balances increased $302.0 billion, or 10
percent, to $3.3 trillion at December 31, 2020
compared to December 31, 2019. The increase in
client balances was primarily due to higher
market valuations and positive client flows.

wide range of lending-related products and
services, integrated working capital management
and treasury solutions, and underwriting and
advisory services through our network of offices
and client relationship teams. Our lending
products and services include commercial loans,
leases, commitment facilities, trade finance,
commercial real estate lending and asset-based
lending. Our treasury solutions business includes
treasury management, foreign exchange, short-term
investing options and merchant services. We also
provide investment banking products to our
clients such as debt and equity underwriting and
distribution, and merger-related and other
advisory services. Underwriting debt and equity
issuances, fixed-income and equity research, and
certain market-based activities are executed
through our global broker-dealer affiliates,
which are our primary dealers in several
countries. Within Global Banking, Global
Corporate Banking clients generally include large
global corporations, financial institutions and
leasing clients. Global Commercial Banking
clients generally include middle-market
companies, commercial real estate firms and not-
for-profit companies. Business Banking clients
include mid-sized U.S.-based businesses requiring
customized and integrated financial advice and
solutions.
Net income for Global Banking decreased $4.6
billion to $3.5 billion primarily driven by
higher provision for credit losses as well as
lower revenue.
Revenue decreased $1.5 billion to $19.0 billion
driven by lower net interest income. Net interest
income decreased $1.7
billion to $9.0 billion primarily driven by lower
interest rates, partially offset by higher loan
and deposit balances.
Noninterest income of $10.0 billion increased
$166 million driven by higher investment banking
fees, partially offset by lower valuation driven
adjustments on the fair value loan portfolio,
debt securities and leveraged loans, as well as
the allocation of ALM results.
The provision for credit losses increased $4.5
billion to $4.9 billion primarily due to the
weaker economic outlook related to COVID-19.
Noninterest expense increased $326 million
primarily due to continued investments in the
business, partially offset by lower revenue-
related incentives.
The return on average allocated capital was eight
percent in 2020 compared to 20 percent in 2019
due to lower net income and, to a lesser extent,
an increase in allocated capital. For information
on capital allocated to the business segments,
see Business Segment Operations on page 36.

Business Lending revenue decreased $933 million
in 2020 compared to 2019. The decrease was
primarily driven by lower interest rates. Global
Transaction Services revenue decreased $1.5
billion in 2020 compared to 2019 driven by the
allocation of ALM results, partially offset by
the impact of higher deposit balances. Average
loans and leases were relatively flat in 2020
compared to 2019. Average deposits increased 26
percent primarily due to client responses to
market volatility, government stimulus and
placement of credit draws. Global Investment
Banking Client teams and product specialists
underwrite and distribute debt, equity and loan
products, and provide advisory services and
tailored risk management solutions. The economics
of certain investment banking and underwriting
activities are shared primarily between Global
Banking and Global Markets under an internal
revenue-sharing arrangement. Global Banking
originates certain deal-related transactions with
our corporate and commercial clients that are
executed and distributed by Global Markets . To

Global Markets offers sales and trading services
and research services to institutional clients
across fixed-income, credit, currency, commodity
and equity businesses. Global Markets product
coverage includes securities and derivative
products in both the primary and secondary
markets. Global Markets provides market-making,
financing, securities clearing, settlement and
custody services globally to our institutional
investor clients in support of their investing
and trading activities. We also work with our
commercial and corporate clients to provide risk
management products using interest rate, equity,
credit, currency and commodity derivatives,
foreign exchange, fixed-income and mortgage-
related products. As a result of our market-
making activities in these products, we may be
required to manage risk in a broad range of
financial products including government
securities, equity and equity-linked securities,
high-grade and high-yield corporate debt
securities, syndicated loans, MBS, commodities
and asset-backed securities. The economics of
certain investment banking and underwriting
activities are shared primarily between Global
Markets and Global Banking under an internal
revenue-sharing arrangement. Global Banking
originates certain deal-related transactions with
our corporate and commercial clients that are
executed and distributed by Global Markets . For
information on investment banking fees on a
consolidated basis, see page 43.
The following explanations for year-over-year
changes for Global Markets , including those
disclosed under Sales and Trading Revenue, are
the same for amounts including and excluding net
DVA. Amounts excluding net DVA are a non-GAAP
financial measure. For more information on net
DVA, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 31.
Net income for Global Markets increased $1.7
billion to $5.2 billion. Net DVA losses were $133
million compared to losses of $222 million in
2019. Excluding net DVA, net income increased
$1.7 billion to $5.4 billion. These increases
were primarily driven by higher revenue,
partially offset by higher noninterest expense
and provision for credit losses.
Revenue increased $3.2 billion to $18.8 billion
primarily driven by higher sales and trading
revenue and investment banking fees. Sales and
trading revenue increased $2.3 billion, and
excluding net DVA, increased $2.2 billion. These
increases were driven by higher revenue across
FICC and Equities.
The provision for credit losses increased $260
million primarily due to the weaker economic
outlook related to COVID-19. Noninterest expense
increased $694 million to
 Bank of America44 
$11.4 billion driven by higher activity-based
expenses for both card and trading. Average total
assets increased $5.7 billion to $685.0 billion
driven by higher client balances in Global
Equities. Year-end total assets decreased $25.2
billion to $616.6 billion driven by lower levels
of inventory in FICC and increased hedging of
client activity in Equities with derivative
transactions relative to stock positions. The
return on average allocated capital was 15
percent, up from 10 percent, reflecting higher
net income, partially offset by an increase in
allocated capital. Sales and Trading Revenue
Sales and trading revenue includes unrealized and
realized gains and losses on trading and other
assets which are included in market making and
similar activities, net interest income, and fees
primarily from commissions on equity securities.
Sales and trading revenue is segregated into
fixed-income (government debt obligations,
investment and non-investment grade corporate
debt obligations, commercial MBS, residential
mortgage-backed securities, collateralized loan
obligations, interest rate and credit derivative
contracts), currencies (interest rate and foreign
exchange contracts), commodities (primarily
futures, forwards, swaps and options) and
equities (equity-linked derivatives and cash
equity activity). The following table and related
discussion present sales and trading revenue,
substantially all of which is in Global Markets,
with the remainder in Global Banking . In
addition, the following table and related
discussion present sales and trading revenue,
excluding net DVA, which is a non-GAAP financial
measure. For more information on net DVA, see
Supplemental Financial Data on page 31.

DVA losses were $130 million and $208 million for
2020 and 2019. Equities net DVA losses were $3
million and $14 million for 2020 and 2019. FICC
revenue increased $1.3 billion driven by
increased client activity and improved market-
making conditions across macro products. Equities
revenue increased $918 million driven by
increased client activity and a strong trading
performance in a more volatile market
environment.

deposit-taking segments, we allocate assets from
All Other to those segments to match liabilities
(i.e., deposits) and allocated shareholders’
equity. Average allocated assets were $763.1
billion and $544.3 billion for 2020 and 2019, and
year-end allocated assets were $977.7 billion and
$565.4 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019.
All Other consists of ALM activities, equity
investments, non-core mortgage loans and
servicing activities, liquidating businesses and
certain expenses not otherwise allocated to a
business segment. ALM activities encompass
certain residential mortgages, debt securities,
and interest rate and foreign currency risk
management activities. Substantially all of the
results of ALM activities are allocated to our
business segments. For more information on our
ALM activities, see Note
23 – Business Segment Information to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.
Residential mortgage loans that are held for ALM
purposes, including interest rate or liquidity
risk management, are classified as core and are
presented on the balance sheet of All Other .
During 2020, residential mortgage loans held for
ALM activities decreased $12.7 billion to $9.0
billion due primarily to loan sales. Non-core
residential mortgage and home equity loans, which
are principally runoff portfolios, are also held
in All
 45Bank of America 
Other . During 2020, total non-core loans
decreased $3.0 billion to $12.6 billion due
primarily to payoffs and paydowns, as well as
Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loan
conveyances and sales, partially offset by
repurchases. For more information on the
composition of the core and non-core portfolios,
see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management on
page 62.
The net loss for All Other decreased $949 million
to a net loss of $407 million, primarily due to a
$2.1 billion pretax impairment charge related to
the notice of termination of the merchant
services joint venture in 2019, partially offset
by lower revenue and higher provision for credit
losses.
Revenue decreased $1.2 billion primarily due to
extinguishment losses on certain structured
liabilities, higher client-driven ESG investment
activity, resulting in higher partnership losses
on these tax-advantaged investments, and lower
net interest income, partially offset by a gain
on sales of mortgage loans.
The provision for credit losses increased $719
million to $50 million from a provision benefit
of $669 million in 2019, primarily due to
recoveries from sales of previously charged-off
non-core consumer real estate loans in 2019, as
well as the weaker economic outlook related to
COVID-19.
Noninterest expense decreased $2.3 billion to
$1.4 billion primarily due to the $2.1 billion
pretax impairment charge in 2019, partially
offset by higher litigation expense.
The income tax benefit increased $589 million
primarily driven by the impact of the U.K. tax
law change and a higher level of income tax
credits related to our ESG investment activity,
partially offset by the positive impact from the
resolution of various tax controversy matters in
2019. Both years included income tax benefit
adjustments to eliminate the FTE treatment of
certain tax credits recorded in Global Banking .
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual
Obligations
We have contractual obligations to make future
payments on debt and lease agreements.
Additionally, in the normal course of business,
we enter into contractual arrangements whereby we
commit to future purchases of products or
services from unaffiliated parties. Purchase
obligations are defined as obligations that are
legally binding agreements whereby we agree to
purchase products or services with a specific
minimum quantity at a fixed, minimum or variable
price over a specified period of time. Included
in purchase obligations are vendor contracts, the
most significant of which include communication
services, processing services and software
contracts. Debt, lease and other obligations are
more fully discussed in Note 11 – Long-term Debt
and Note 12 – Commitments and Contingencies to
the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Other long-term liabilities include our
contractual funding obligations related to the
Non-U.S. Pension Plans and Nonqualified and Other
Pension Plans (together, the Plans). Obligations
to the Plans are based on the current and
projected obligations of the Plans, performance
of the Plans’ assets, and any participant
contributions, if applicable. During 2020 and
2019, we contributed $115 million and $135
million to the Plans, and we expect to make $136
million of contributions during 2021. The Plans
are more fully discussed in Note 17 – Employee
Benefit Plans to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.
We enter into commitments to extend credit such
as loan commitments, standby letters of credit
(SBLCs) and commercial letters of credit to meet
the financing needs of our customers. For a
summary of the total unfunded, or off-balance
sheet, credit extension commitment amounts by
expiration date, see Credit Extension Commitments
in Note 12 – Commitments and Contingencies to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.
We also utilize variable interest entities (VIEs)
in the ordinary course of business to support our
financing and investing needs as well as those of
our customers. For more information on our
involvement with unconsolidated VIEs, see Note 6
– Securitizations and Other Variable Interest
Entities to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

 Managing Risk 
Risk is inherent in all our business activities.
Sound risk management enables us to serve our
customers and deliver for our shareholders. If
not managed well, risks can result in financial
loss, regulatory sanctions and penalties, and
damage to our reputation, each of which may
adversely impact our ability to execute our
business strategies. We take a comprehensive
approach to risk management with a defined Risk
Framework and an articulated Risk Appetite
Statement, which are approved annually by the ERC
and the Board.
The seven key types of risk faced by the
Corporation are strategic, credit, market,
liquidity, compliance, operational and
reputational.
● Strategic risk is the risk to current or
projected financial condition arising from
incorrect assumptions about external or internal
factors, inappropriate business plans,
ineffective business strategy execution, or
failure to respond in a timely manner to changes
in the regulatory, macroeconomic or competitive
environments in the geographic locations in which
we operate.
● Credit risk is the risk of loss arising from
the inability or failure of a borrower or
counterparty to meet its obligations.
● Market risk is the risk that changes in market
conditions may adversely impact the value of
assets or liabilities, or otherwise negatively
impact earnings. Market risk is composed of price
risk and interest rate risk.
● Liquidity risk is the inability to meet
expected or unexpected cash flow and collateral
needs while continuing to support our businesses
and customers under a range of economic
conditions.
● Compliance risk is the risk of legal or
regulatory sanctions, material financial loss or
damage to the reputation of the Corporation
arising from the failure of the Corporation to
comply with the requirements of applicable laws,
rules and regulations and our internal policies
and procedures.
● Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting
from inadequate or failed processes, people and
systems, or from external events.
● Reputational risk is the risk that negative
perceptions of the Corporation’s conduct or
business practices may adversely impact its
profitability or operations.
The following sections address in more detail the
specific procedures, measures and analyses of the
major categories of risk. This discussion of
managing risk focuses on the current Risk
Framework that, as part of its annual review
process, was approved by the ERC and the Board.
As set forth in our Risk Framework, a culture of
managing risk well is fundamental to fulfilling
our purpose and our values and delivering
responsible growth. It requires us to focus on
risk in all activities and encourages the
necessary mindset and behavior to enable
effective risk management, and promotes sound
risk-taking within our risk appetite. Sustaining
a culture of managing risk well throughout the
organization is critical to our success and is a
clear expectation of our executive management
team and the Board.
Our Risk Framework serves as the foundation for
the consistent and effective management of risks
facing the Corporation. The Risk Framework sets
forth clear roles, responsibilities and
accountability for the management of risk and
provides a blueprint for how the Board, through
delegation of authority to committees and
executive officers, establishes risk appetite and
associated limits for our activities.
Executive management assesses, with Board
oversight, the risk-adjusted returns of each
business. Management reviews and approves the
strategic and financial operating plans, as well
as the capital plan and Risk Appetite Statement,
and recommends them annually to the Board for
approval. Our strategic plan takes into
consideration return objectives and financial
resources, which must align with risk capacity
and risk appetite. Management sets financial
objectives for each business by allocating
capital and setting a target for return on
capital for each business. Capital allocations
and operating limits are regularly evaluated as
part of our overall governance processes as the
businesses and the economic environment in which
we operate continue to evolve. For more
information regarding capital allocations, see
Business Segment Operations on page 36.
The Corporation’s risk appetite indicates the
amount of capital, earnings or liquidity we are
willing to put at risk to achieve our strategic
objectives and business plans, consistent with
applicable regulatory requirements. Our risk
appetite provides a common and comparable set of
measures for senior management and the Board to
clearly indicate our aggregate level of risk and
to monitor whether the Corporation’s risk profile
remains in alignment with our strategic and
capital plans. Our risk appetite is formally
articulated in the Risk Appetite Statement, which
includes both qualitative components and
quantitative limits.
Our overall capacity to take risk is limited;
therefore, we prioritize the risks we take in
order to maintain a strong and flexible financial
position so we can withstand challenging economic
conditions and take advantage of organic growth
opportunities. Therefore, we set objectives and
targets for capital and liquidity that are
intended to permit us to continue to operate in a
safe and sound manner, including during periods
of stress.
Our lines of business operate with risk limits
(which may include credit, market and/or
operational limits, as applicable) that align
with the Corporation’s risk appetite. Executive
management is responsible for tracking and
reporting performance measurements as well as any
exceptions to guidelines or limits. The Board,
and its committees when appropriate, oversee
financial performance, execution of the strategic
and financial operating plans, adherence to risk
appetite limits and the adequacy of internal
controls.
For a more detailed discussion of our risk
management activities, see the discussion below
and pages 50 through 85.
For more information about the Corporation's
risks related to the pandemic, see Part I. Item
1A. Risk Factors on page 7. These COVID-19
related risks are being managed within our Risk
Framework and supporting risk management
programs.
 Risk Management Governance 
The Risk Framework describes delegations of
authority whereby the Board and its committees
may delegate authority to management-level
committees or executive officers. Such
delegations may authorize certain decision-making
and approval functions, which may be evidenced
in, for example, committee charters, job
descriptions, meeting minutes and resolutions.
The chart below illustrates the inter-
relationship among the Board, Board committees
and management committees that have the majority
of risk oversight responsibilities for the
Corporation.
 47Bank of America 
The chart below illustrates the inter-relationship among the Board, Board committees and management
committees that have the majority of risk oversight responsibilities for the Corporation.
 Board of Directors and Board Committees 
The Board is composed of 17 directors, all but
one of whom are independent. The Board authorizes
management to maintain an effective Risk
Framework, and oversees compliance with safe and
sound banking practices. In addition, the Board
or its committees conduct inquiries of, and
receive reports from management on risk-related
matters to assess scope or resource limitations
that could impede the ability of Independent Risk
Management (IRM) and/or Corporate Audit to
execute its responsibilities. The Board
committees discussed below have the principal
responsibility for enterprise-wide oversight of
our risk management activities. Through these
activities, the Board and applicable committees
are provided with information on our risk profile
and oversee executive management addressing key
risks we face. Other Board committees, as
described below, provide additional oversight of
specific risks.
Each of the committees shown on the above chart
regularly reports to the Board on risk-related
matters within the committee’s responsibilities,
which is intended to collectively provide the
Board with integrated insight about our
management of enterprise-wide risks.
 Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee oversees the qualifications,
performance and independence of the Independent
Registered Public Accounting Firm, the
performance of our corporate audit function, the
integrity of our consolidated financial
statements, our compliance with legal and
regulatory requirements, and makes inquiries of
management or the Chief Audit Executive (CAE) to
determine whether there are scope or resource
limitations that impede the ability of Corporate
Audit to execute its responsibilities. The Audit
Committee is also responsible for overseeing
compliance risk pursuant to the New York Stock
Exchange listing standards.
 Enterprise Risk Committee 
The ERC has primary responsibility for oversight
of the Risk Framework and key risks we face and
of the Corporation’s overall risk appetite. It
approves the Risk Framework and the Risk Appetite
Statement and further recommends these documents
to the Board for approval. The ERC oversees
senior management’s responsibilities for the
identification, measurement, monitoring and
control of key risks we face. The
ERC may consult with other Board committees on
risk-related matters.
 Other Board Committees 
Our Corporate Governance, ESG, and Sustainability
Committee oversees our Board’s governance
processes, identifies and reviews the
qualifications of potential Board members,
recommends nominees for election to our Board,
recommends committee appointments for Board
approval and reviews our Environmental, Social
and Governance and stockholder engagement
activities.
Our Compensation and Human Capital Committee
oversees establishing, maintaining and
administering our compensation programs and
employee benefit plans, including approving and
recommending our Chief Executive Officer’s (CEO)
compensation to our Board for further approval by
all independent directors; reviewing and
approving all of our executive officers’
compensation, as well as compensation for non-
management directors; and reviewing certain other
human capital management topics.
 Management Committees 
Management committees may receive their authority
from the Board, a Board committee, another
management committee or from one or more
executive officers. Our primary management level
risk committee is the Management Risk Committee
(MRC). Subject to Board oversight, the MRC is
responsible for management oversight of key risks
facing the Corporation. This includes providing
management oversight of our compliance and
operational risk programs, balance sheet and
capital management, funding activities and other
liquidity activities, stress testing, trading
activities, recovery and resolution planning,
model risk, subsidiary governance and activities
between member banks and their nonbank affiliates
pursuant to Federal Reserve rules and
regulations, among other things.
 Lines of Defense 
We have clear ownership and accountability across
three lines of defense: Front Line Units (FLUs),
IRM and Corporate Audit. We also have control
functions outside of FLUs and IRM (e.g., Legal
and Global Human Resources). The three lines of
defense are integrated into our management-level
governance structure. Each of these functional
roles is further described in this section.
 Bank of America48 
 Executive Officers 
Executive officers lead various functions
representing the functional roles. Authority for
functional roles may be delegated to executive
officers from the Board, Board committees or
management-level committees. Executive officers,
in turn, may further delegate responsibilities,
as appropriate, to management level committees,
management routines or individuals. Executive
officers review our activities for consistency
with our Risk Framework, Risk Appetite Statement
and applicable strategic, capital and financial
operating plans, as well as applicable policies,
standards, procedures and processes. Executive
officers and other employees make decisions
individually on a day-to-day basis, consistent
with the authority they have been delegated.
Executive officers and other employees may also
serve on committees and participate in committee
decisions.
 Front Line Units 
FLUs, which include the lines of business as well
as the Global Technology and Operations Group,
are responsible for appropriately assessing and
effectively managing all of the risks
associated with their activities.
Three organizational units that include FLU
activities and control function activities, but
are not part of IRM are first, the Chief
Financial Officer (CFO) Group; second,
Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG),
Capital Deployment (CD) and Public Policy (PP);
and third, the Chief Administrative Officer (CAO)
Group.
 Independent Risk Management 
IRM is part of our control functions and includes
Global Risk Management. We have other control
functions that are not part of IRM (other control
functions may also provide oversight to FLU
activities), including Legal, Global Human
Resources and certain activities within the CFO
Group; ESG, CD and PP; and CAO Group. IRM, led by
the Chief Risk Officer (CRO), is responsible for
independently assessing and overseeing risks
within FLUs and other control functions. IRM
establishes written enterprise policies and
procedures that include concentration risk
limits, where appropriate. Such policies and
procedures outline how aggregate risks are
identified, measured, monitored and controlled.
The CRO has the stature, authority and
independence to develop and implement a
meaningful risk management framework. The CRO has
unrestricted access to the Board and reports
directly to both the ERC and to the CEO. Global
Risk Management is organized into horizontal risk
teams that cover a specific risk area and
vertical CRO teams that cover a particular front
line unit or control function. These teams work
collaboratively in executing their respective
duties.
 Corporate Audit 
Corporate Audit and the CAE maintain their
independence from the FLUs, IRM and other control
functions by reporting directly to the Audit
Committee or the Board. The CAE administratively
reports to the CEO. Corporate Audit provides
independent assessment and validation through
testing of key processes and controls across the
Corporation. Corporate Audit includes Credit
Review which periodically tests and examines
credit portfolios and processes.
 Risk Management Processes 
The Risk Framework requires that strong risk
management practices are integrated in key
strategic, capital and financial planning
processes and in day-to-day business processes
across the Corporation, with a goal of ensuring
risks are
appropriately considered, evaluated and responded
to in a timely manner. We employ our risk
management process, referred to as Identify,
Measure, Monitor and Control, as part of our
daily activities.
Identify – To be effectively managed, risks must
be clearly defined and proactively identified.
Proper risk identification focuses on recognizing
and understanding key risks inherent in our
business activities or key risks that may arise
from external factors. Each employee is expected
to identify and escalate risks promptly. Risk
identification is an ongoing process,
incorporating input from FLUs and control
functions, designed to be forward looking and
capture relevant risk factors across all of our
lines of business.
Measure – Once a risk is identified, it must be
prioritized and accurately measured through a
systematic risk quantification process including
quantitative and qualitative components. Risk is
measured at various levels including, but not
limited to, risk type, FLU, legal entity and on
an aggregate basis. This
risk quantification process helps to capture
changes in our risk profile due to changes in
strategic direction, concentrations, portfolio
quality and the overall economic environment.
Senior management considers how risk exposures
might evolve under a variety of stress scenarios.
Monitor – We monitor risk levels regularly to
track adherence to risk appetite, policies,
standards, procedures and processes. We also
regularly update risk assessments and review risk
exposures. Through our monitoring, we can
determine our level of risk relative to limits
and can take action in a timely manner. We also
can determine when risk limits are breached and
have processes to appropriately report and
escalate exceptions. This includes requests for
approval to managers and alerts to executive
management, management-level committees or the
Board (directly or through an appropriate
committee).
Control – We establish and communicate risk
limits and controls through policies, standards,
procedures and processes that define the
responsibilities and authority for risk-taking.
The limits and controls can be adjusted by the
Board or management when conditions or risk
tolerances warrant. These limits may be absolute
(e.g., loan amount, trading volume) or relative
(e.g., percentage of loan book in higher-risk
categories). Our lines of business are held
accountable to perform within the established
limits.
The formal processes used to manage risk
represent a part of our overall risk management
process. We instill a strong and comprehensive
culture of managing risk well through
communications, training, policies, procedures
and organizational roles and responsibilities.
Establishing a culture reflective of our purpose
to help make our customers’ financial lives
better and delivering our responsible growth
strategy is also critical to effective risk
management. We understand that improper actions,
behaviors or practices that are illegal,
unethical or contrary to our core values could
result in harm to the Corporation, our
shareholders or our customers, damage the
integrity of the financial markets, or negatively
impact our reputation, and have established
protocols and structures so that such conduct
risk is governed and reported across the
Corporation. Specifically, our Code of Conduct
provides a framework for all of our employees to
conduct themselves with the highest integrity.
Additionally, we continue to strengthen the link
between the employee performance management
process and individual compensation to encourage
employees to work toward enterprise-wide risk
goals.
 49Bank of America 
 Corporation-wide Stress Testing 
Integral to our Capital Planning, Financial
Planning and Strategic Planning processes, we
conduct capital scenario management and stress
forecasting on a periodic basis to better
understand balance sheet, earnings and capital
sensitivities to certain economic and business
scenarios, including economic and market
conditions that are more severe than anticipated.
These stress forecasts provide an understanding
of the potential impacts from our risk profile on
the balance sheet, earnings and capital, and
serve as a key component of our capital and risk
management practices. The intent of stress
testing is to develop a comprehensive
understanding of potential impacts of on- and
off-balance sheet risks at the Corporation and
how they impact financial resiliency, which
provides confidence to management, regulators and
our investors.
 Contingency Planning 
We have developed and maintain contingency plans
that are designed to prepare us in advance to
respond in the event of potential adverse
economic, financial or market stress. These
contingency plans include our Capital Contingency
Plan and Financial Contingency and Recovery Plan,
which provide monitoring, escalation, actions and
routines designed to enable us to increase
capital, access funding sources and reduce risk
through consideration of potential options that
include asset sales, business sales, capital or
debt issuances, or other de-risking strategies.
We also maintain a Resolution Plan to limit
adverse systemic impacts that could be associated
with a potential resolution of Bank of America.
 Strategic Risk Management 
Strategic risk is embedded in every business and
is one of the major risk categories along with
credit, market, liquidity, compliance,
operational and reputational risks. This risk
results from incorrect assumptions about external
or internal factors, inappropriate business
plans, ineffective business strategy execution,
or failure to respond in a timely manner to
changes in the regulatory, macroeconomic or
competitive environments in the geographic
locations in which we operate, such as competitor
actions, changing customer preferences, product
obsolescence and technology developments. Our
strategic plan is consistent with our risk
appetite, capital plan and liquidity requirements
and specifically addresses strategic risks.
On an annual basis, the Board reviews and
approves the strategic plan, capital plan,
financial operating plan and Risk Appetite
Statement. With oversight by the Board, executive
management directs the lines of business to
execute our strategic plan consistent with our
core operating principles and risk appetite. The
executive management team monitors business
performance throughout the year and provides the
Board with regular progress reports on whether
strategic objectives and timelines are being met,
including reports on strategic risks and if
additional or alternative actions need to be
considered or implemented. The regular executive
reviews focus on assessing forecasted earnings
and returns on capital, the current risk profile,
current capital and liquidity requirements,
staffing levels and changes required to support
the strategic plan, stress testing results, and
other qualitative factors such as market growth
rates and peer analysis.
Significant strategic actions, such as capital
actions, material acquisitions or divestitures,
and resolution plans are reviewed and approved by
the Board. At the business level, processes are
in place to discuss the strategic risk
implications of new, expanded or modified
businesses, products or services and other
strategic initiatives, and to provide formal
review and
approval where required. With oversight by the
Board and the ERC, executive management performs
similar analyses throughout the year and
evaluates changes to the financial forecast or
the risk, capital or liquidity positions as
deemed appropriate to balance and optimize
achieving the targeted risk appetite, shareholder
returns and maintaining the targeted financial
strength. Proprietary models are used to measure
the capital requirements for credit, country,
market, operational and strategic risks. The
allocated capital assigned to each business is
based on its unique risk profile. With oversight
by the Board, executive management assesses the
risk-adjusted returns of each business in
approving strategic and financial operating
plans. The businesses use allocated capital to
define business strategies and price products and
transactions.
 Capital Management 
The Corporation manages its capital position so
that its capital is more than adequate to support
its business activities and aligns with risk,
risk appetite and strategic planning.
Additionally, we seek to maintain safety and
soundness at all times, even under adverse
scenarios, take advantage of organic growth
opportunities, meet obligations to creditors and
counterparties, maintain ready access to
financial markets, continue to serve as a credit
intermediary, remain a source of strength for our
subsidiaries, and satisfy current and future
regulatory capital requirements. Capital
management is integrated into our risk and
governance processes, as capital is a key
consideration in the development of our strategic
plan, risk appetite and risk limits.
We conduct an Internal Capital Adequacy
Assessment Process (ICAAP) on a periodic basis.
The ICAAP is a forward-looking assessment of our
projected capital needs and resources,
incorporating earnings, balance sheet and risk
forecasts under baseline and adverse economic and
market conditions. We utilize periodic stress
tests to assess the potential impacts to our
balance sheet, earnings, regulatory capital and
liquidity under a variety of stress scenarios. We
perform qualitative risk assessments to identify
and assess material risks not fully captured in
our forecasts or stress tests. We assess the
potential capital impacts of proposed changes to
regulatory capital requirements. Management
assesses ICAAP results and provides documented
quarterly assessments of the adequacy of our
capital guidelines and capital position to the
Board or its committees.
We periodically review capital allocated to our
businesses and allocate capital annually during
the strategic and capital planning processes. For
more information, see Business Segment Operations
on page 36.
 CCAR and Capital Planning 
The Federal Reserve requires BHCs to submit a
capital plan and planned capital actions on an
annual basis, consistent with the rules governing
the CCAR capital plan.
Based on the results of our 2020 CCAR supervisory
stress test that was submitted to the Federal
Reserve in the second quarter of 2020, we are
subject to a 2.5 percent stress capital buffer
(SCB) for the period beginning October 1, 2020
and ending on September 30, 2021. Our Common
equity tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio under the
Standardized approach must remain above 9.5
percent during this period (the sum of our CET1
capital ratio minimum of 4.5 percent, global
systemically important bank (G-SIB) surcharge of
2.5 percent and our SCB of 2.5 percent) in order
to avoid restrictions on capital distributions
and discretionary bonus payments.
 Bank of America50 
Due to economic uncertainty resulting from the
pandemic, the Federal Reserve required all large
banks to update and resubmit their capital plans
in November 2020 based on the Federal Reserve’s
updated supervisory stress test scenarios. The
results of the additional supervisory stress
tests were published in December 2020.
The Federal Reserve also required large banks to
suspend share repurchase programs during the
second half of 2020, except for repurchases to
offset shares awarded under equity-based
compensation plans, and to limit common stock
dividends to existing rates that did not exceed
the average of the last four quarters’ net
income. The Federal Reserve’s directives
regarding share repurchases aligned with our
decision to voluntarily suspend our general
common stock repurchase program during the first
half of 2020. The suspension of our repurchases
did not include repurchases to offset shares
awarded under our equity-based compensation
plans. Pursuant to the Board’s authorization, we
repurchased $7.0 billion of common stock during
2020.
In December 2020, the Federal Reserve announced
that beginning in the first quarter of 2021,
large banks would be permitted to pay common
stock dividends at existing rates and to
repurchase shares in an amount that, when
combined with dividends paid, does not exceed the
average of net income over the last four
quarters.
On January 19, 2021, we announced that the Board
declared a quarterly common stock dividend of
$0.18 per share, payable on March 26, 2021 to
shareholders of record as of March 5, 2021. We
also announced that the Board authorized the
repurchase of $2.9 billion in common stock
through March 31, 2021, plus repurchases to
offset shares awarded under equity-based
compensation plans during the same period,
estimated to be approximately $300 million. This
authorization equals the maximum amount allowed
by the Federal Reserve for the period.
Our stock repurchase program is subject to
various factors, including the Corporation’s
capital position, liquidity, financial
performance and alternative uses of capital,
stock trading price and general market
conditions, and may be suspended at any time.
Such repurchases may be effected through open
market purchases or privately negotiated
transactions, including repurchase plans that
satisfy the conditions of Rule 10b5-1 of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(Exchange Act).
 Regulatory Capital 
As a financial services holding company, we are
subject to regulatory capital rules, including
Basel 3, issued by U.S. banking regulators. Basel
3 established minimum capital ratios and buffer
requirements and outlined two methods of
calculating risk-weighted assets (RWA), the
Standardized approach and the Advanced
approaches. The Standardized approach relies
primarily on supervisory risk weights based on
exposure type, and the Advanced approaches
determine risk weights based on internal models.
The Corporation's depository institution
subsidiaries are also subject to the Prompt
Corrective Action (PCA) framework. The
Corporation and its primary affiliated banking
entity, BANA, are Advanced approaches
institutions under Basel 3 and are required to
report regulatory risk-based capital ratios and
RWA under both the Standardized and Advanced
approaches. The approach that yields the lower
ratio is used to assess capital adequacy
including under the PCA framework. As of December
31, 2020, the CET1, Tier 1 capital and Total
capital ratios for the Corporation were lower
under the Standardized approach.
 Minimum Capital Requirements 
In order to avoid restrictions on capital
distributions and discretionary bonus payments,
the Corporation must meet risk-based capital
ratio requirements that include a capital
conservation buffer greater than 2.5 percent,
plus any applicable countercyclical capital
buffer and a G-SIB surcharge. On October 1, 2020,
the capital conservation buffer was replaced by
the SCB for the Corporation’s Standardized
approach ratio requirements. The buffers and
surcharge must be comprised solely of CET1
capital.
The Corporation is also required to maintain a
minimum supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) of 3.0
percent plus a leverage buffer of 2.0 percent in
order to avoid certain restrictions on capital
distributions and discretionary bonus payments.
Our insured depository institution subsidiaries
are required to maintain a minimum 6.0 percent
SLR to be considered well capitalized under the
PCA framework. The numerator of the SLR is
quarter-end Basel 3 Tier 1 capital. The
denominator is total leverage exposure based on
the daily average of the sum of on-balance sheet
exposures less permitted deductions and
applicable temporary exclusions, as well as the
simple average of certain off-balance sheet
exposures, as of the end of each month in a
quarter. For more information, see Capital
Management – Regulatory Developments on page 55.

(1) As of December 31, 2020, capital ratios are
calculated using the regulatory capital rule that

using the standardized approach for measuring
counterparty credit risk at December 31, 2020 and
the current exposure method at December 31, 2019.
(3) The capital conservation buffer and G-SIB
surcharge were 2.5 percent at both December 31,
2020 and 2019. At December 31, 2020, the
Corporation's SCB of 2.5 percent was applied in
place of the capital conservation buffer under
the Standardized approach. The countercyclical
capital buffer for both periods was zero. The SLR
minimum includes a leverage buffer of 2.0
percent.
(4) Total capital under the Advanced approaches
differs from the Standardized approach due to
differences in the amount permitted in Tier 2
capital related to the qualifying allowance for

(6) Supplementary leverage exposure at December
31, 2020 reflects the temporary exclusion of U.S.
Treasury securities and deposits at Federal

At December 31, 2020, CET1 capital was $176.7
billion, an increase of $9.9 billion from
December 31, 2019, driven by earnings and net
unrealized gains on available-for-sale (AFS) debt
securities included in accumulated other
comprehensive income (OCI), partially offset by
common stock repurchases and dividends. Total
capital under the Standardized approach increased
$16.7 billion primarily driven by the same
factors as CET1 capital, an increase in the
adjusted allowance for credit
losses included in Tier 2 capital and the
issuance of preferred stock. RWA under the
Standardized approach, which yielded the lower
CET1 capital ratio at December 31, 2020,
decreased $13.7 billion during 2020 to $1,480
billion primarily due to lower commercial and
consumer lending exposures, partially offset by
investments of excess deposits in securities.

(1) As of December 31, 2020, capital ratios are calculated using the regulatory capital rule that
allows a five-year transition period related to the adoption of CECL.
(2) Derivative exposure amounts are calculated using the standardized approach for measuring
counterparty credit risk at December 31, 2020 and the current exposure method at December 31, 2019.
(3) Risk-based capital regulatory minimums at both December 31, 2020 and 2019 are the minimum ratios
under Basel 3 including a capital conservation buffer of 2.5 percent. The regulatory minimums for the
leverage ratios as of both period ends are the percent required to be considered well capitalized
under the PCA framework.
(4) Total capital under the Advanced approaches differs from the Standardized approach due to
differences in the amount permitted in Tier 2 capital related to the qualifying allowance for credit
losses.
(5) Reflects total average assets adjusted for certain Tier 1 capital deductions.
 Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity Requirements 
Total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) consists of
the Corporation’s Tier 1 capital and eligible
long-term debt issued directly by the
Corporation. Eligible long-term debt for TLAC
ratios is comprised of unsecured debt that has a
remaining maturity of at least one year and
satisfies additional requirements as prescribed
in the TLAC final rule. As with the
risk-based capital ratios and SLR, the
Corporation is required to maintain TLAC ratios
in excess of minimum requirements plus applicable
buffers to avoid restrictions on capital
distributions and discretionary bonus payments.

(2) The TLAC RWA regulatory minimum consists of 18.0 percent plus a TLAC RWA buffer comprised of 2.5
percent plus the Method 1 G-SIB surcharge of 1.5 percent. The countercyclical buffer is zero for both
periods. The TLAC supplementary leverage exposure regulatory minimum consists of 7.5 percent plus a
2.0 percent TLAC leverage buffer. The TLAC RWA and leverage buffers must be comprised solely of CET1
capital and Tier 1 capital, respectively.
(3) The long-term debt RWA regulatory minimum is comprised of 6.0 percent plus an additional 2.5
percent requirement based on the Corporation’s Method 2 G-SIB surcharge. The long-term debt leverage
exposure regulatory minimum is 4.5 percent.
(4) The approach that yields the higher RWA is used to calculate TLAC and long-term debt ratios,
which was the Standardized approach as of both December 31, 2020 and 2019.
(5) Supplementary leverage exposure at December 31, 2020 reflects the temporary exclusion of U.S.
Treasury Securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks.
(6) Derivative exposure amounts are calculated using the standardized approach for measuring
counterparty credit risk at December 31, 2020 and the current exposure method at December 31, 2019.
 Regulatory Developments 
Revisions to Basel 3 to Address Current Expected
Credit Loss Accounting
On January 1, 2020, the Corporation adopted the
new accounting standard that requires the
measurement of the allowance for credit losses to
be based on management’s best estimate of
lifetime ECL inherent in the Corporation's
relevant financial assets. For more information,
see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting
Principles to the Consolidated Financial
Statements. During the first quarter of 2020, in
accordance with an interim final rule issued by
U.S. banking regulators that was finalized on
August 26, 2020, the Corporation delayed for two
years the initial adoption impact of CECL on
regulatory capital, followed by a three-year
transition period to phase out the aggregate
amount of the capital benefit provided during
2020 and 2021 (i.e., a five-year transition
period). During the two-year delay, the
Corporation will add back to CET1 capital 100
percent of the initial adoption impact of CECL
plus 25 percent of the cumulative quarterly
changes in the allowance for credit losses (i.e.,
quarterly transitional amounts). After two years,
starting on January 1, 2022, the quarterly
transitional amounts along with the initial
adoption impact of CECL will be phased out of
CET1 capital over the three-year period.
 Stress Capital Buffer 
On March 4, 2020, the Federal Reserve issued a
final rule that integrates the annual
quantitative assessment of the CCAR program with
the buffer requirements in the U.S. Basel 3 Final
Rule. The new approach replaced the static 2.5
percent capital conservation buffer for Basel 3
Standardized approach requirements with a SCB,
calculated as the decline in the CET1 capital
ratio under the supervisory severely adverse
scenario plus four quarters of planned common
stock dividends, floored at 2.5 percent. Based on
the CCAR 2020 supervisory stress test results,
the Corporation is subject to a 2.5 percent SCB
for the period beginning October 1, 2020 and
ending on September 30, 2021.
In conjunction with this new requirement, the
Federal Reserve has removed the annual CCAR
quantitative objection process beginning with
CCAR 2020. While the final rule continues to
require that the Corporation describe its planned
capital distributions in its CCAR capital plan,
the Corporation is no longer required to seek
prior approval if it makes capital distributions
in excess of those included in its CCAR capital
plan. The Corporation is instead subject to
automatic distribution limitations if its capital
ratios fall below its buffer requirements, which
include the SCB.
 Eligible Retained Income 
On March 17, 2020, in response to the economic
impact of the pandemic, the U.S. banking
regulators issued an interim final rule that
revises the definition of eligible retained
income to be based on average net income over the
prior four quarters. This change, which was
finalized on August 26, 2020, more gradually
phases in automatic distribution restrictions to
the extent capital buffers are breached.
 Supplementary Leverage Ratio 
On April 1, 2020, in response to the economic
impact of the pandemic, the Federal Reserve
issued an interim final rule to temporarily
exclude the on-balance sheet amounts of U.S.
Treasury securities and deposits at Federal
Reserve Banks from the calculation of
supplementary leverage exposure for bank holding
companies. The rule is effective for June 30,
2020 through March 31, 2021 reports. As of
December 31, 2020, temporary exclusions improved
the SLR by 1.0 percent to 7.2 percent.
On May 15, 2020, the U.S. banking regulators
issued an interim final rule that provides a
similar temporary exclusion to depository
institutions, effective from the beginning of the
second quarter of 2020 through March 31, 2021;
however, institutions must elect the relief.
Beginning in the third quarter of 2020, a
depository institution electing to apply the
exclusion must receive approval from its primary
regulator prior to making any capital
distributions as long as the exclusion is in
effect. As of December 31, 2020, the
Corporation’s insured depository institution
subsidiaries have not elected the exclusion.
 Paycheck Protection Program Loans 
On April 9, 2020, in response to the economic
impact of the pandemic, the U.S. banking
regulators issued an interim final rule that,
among other things, stipulates PPP loans, which
are guaranteed by the SBA, will receive a zero
percent risk weight under the Basel 3 Advanced
and Standardized approaches. The rule was later
finalized by the U.S. banking regulators on
October 28, 2020. For more information on the
PPP, see Executive Summary – Recent Developments
– COVID-19 Pandemic on page 25 and Note 1 –
Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to
the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 55Bank of America 
Standardized Approach for Measuring Counterparty
Credit Risk
On June 30, 2020 the Corporation adopted the new
standardized approach for measuring counterparty
credit risk (SA-CCR), which replaces the current
exposure method for calculating the exposure
amount of derivative contracts for risk-weighted
assets and supplementary leverage exposure.
Adoption of SA-CCR resulted in a decrease of
approximately $15 billion in the Corporation’s
Standardized RWA, and a $66 billion decrease in
supplementary leverage exposure.
 Swap Dealer Capital Requirements 
On July 22, 2020, the U.S. Commodity Futures
Trading Commission (CFTC) issued a final rule to
establish capital requirements for swap dealers
and major swap participants that are not subject
to existing U.S. prudential regulation. Under the
rule, applicable subsidiaries of the Corporation
would be permitted to elect one of two approaches
to compute their regulatory capital. The first
approach is a bank-based capital approach, which
requires that firms maintain CET1 capital greater
than or equal to 6.5 percent of the entity’s RWA
as calculated under Basel 3, Total capital
greater than or equal to 8.0 percent of the
entity’s RWA as calculated under Basel 3 and
Total capital greater than or equal to 8.0
percent of the entity’s uncleared swap margin.
The second approach is based on net liquid assets
and requires that a firm maintain net capital
greater than or equal to 2.0 percent of its
uncleared swap margin. The final rule also
includes reporting requirements. The impact on
the Corporation is not expected to be
significant.
 Deduction of Unsecured Debt of G-SIBs 
On October 20, 2020, the Federal Reserve, Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (U.S.
Agencies) finalized a rule requiring Advanced
approaches institutions to deduct from regulatory
capital certain investments in TLAC-eligible
long-term debt and other pari passu or
subordinated debt instruments issued by G-SIBs
above a specified threshold. The final rule is
intended to limit the interconnectedness between
G-SIBs and is complementary to existing
regulatory capital requirements that generally
require banks to deduct investments in the
regulatory capital of financial institutions. The
final rule is effective April 1, 2021. The impact
to the Corporation is not expected to be
significant.
 Volcker Rule 
Effective January 1, 2020, we became subject to
certain changes to the Volcker Rule, including
removing the requirement for banking
organizations to deduct from Tier 1 capital
ownership interests of covered funds acquired or
retained under the underwriting or market-making
exemptions of the Volcker Rule, which the banking
entity did not organize or offer.
 Single-Counterparty Credit Limits 
The Federal Reserve established single-
counterparty credit limits (SCCL) for BHCs with
total consolidated assets of $250 billion or
more. The SCCL rule is designed to ensure that
the maximum possible loss that a BHC could incur
due to the default of a single counterparty or a
group of connected counterparties would not
endanger the BHC’s survival, thereby reducing the
probability of future financial crises. Beginning
January 1, 2020, G-SIBs must calculate SCCL on a
daily basis by dividing the aggregate net credit
exposure to a given counterparty by the G-SIB’s
Tier 1 capital, ensuring that exposures to other
G-SIBs
and nonbank financial institutions regulated by
the Federal Reserve do not breach 15 percent of
Tier 1 capital and exposures to most other
counterparties do not breach 25 percent of Tier 1
capital. Certain exposures, including exposures
to the U.S. government, U.S. government-sponsored
entities and qualifying central counterparties,
are exempt from the credit limits.
 Regulatory Capital and Securities Regulation 
The Corporation’s principal U.S. broker-dealer
subsidiaries are BofA Securities, Inc. (BofAS),
Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp. (MLPCC)
and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith
Incorporated (MLPF&S). The Corporation's
principal European broker-dealer subsidiaries are
Merrill Lynch International (MLI) and BofA
Securities Europe SA (BofASE).
The U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject
to the net capital requirements of Rule 15c3-1
under the Exchange Act. BofAS computes its
minimum capital requirements as an alternative
net capital broker-dealer under Rule 15c3-1e, and
MLPCC and MLPF&S compute their minimum capital
requirements in accordance with the alternative
standard under Rule 15c3-1. BofAS and MLPCC are
also registered as futures commission merchants
and are subject to CFTC Regulation 1.17. The U.S.
broker-dealer subsidiaries are also registered
with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority,
Inc. (FINRA). Pursuant to FINRA Rule 4110, FINRA
may impose higher net capital requirements than
Rule 15c3-1 under the Exchange Act with respect
to each of the broker-dealers.
BofAS provides institutional services, and in
accordance with the alternative net capital
requirements, is required to maintain tentative
net capital in excess of $1.0 billion and net
capital in excess of the greater of $500 million
or a certain percentage of its reserve
requirement. BofAS must also notify the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the
event its tentative net capital is less than $5.0
billion. BofAS is also required to hold a certain
percentage of its customers' and affiliates'
risk-based margin in order to meet its CFTC
minimum net capital requirement. At December 31,
2020, BofAS had tentative net capital of $16.8
billion. BofAS also had regulatory net capital of
$14.1 billion, which exceeded the minimum
requirement of $2.9 billion.
MLPCC is a fully-guaranteed subsidiary of BofAS
and provides clearing and settlement services as
well as prime brokerage and arranged financing
services for institutional clients. At December
31, 2020, MLPCC’s regulatory net capital of $8.6
billion exceeded the minimum requirement of $1.4
billion.
MLPF&S provides retail services. At December 31,
2020, MLPF&S' regulatory net capital was $3.6
billion, which exceeded the minimum requirement
of $180 million.
Our European broker-dealers are regulated by
non-U.S. regulators. MLI, a U.K. investment firm,
is regulated by the Prudential Regulation
Authority and the FCA and is subject to certain
regulatory capital requirements. At December 31,
2020, MLI’s capital resources were $34.1 billion,
which exceeded the minimum Pillar 1 requirement
of $14.7 billion. BofASE, a French investment
firm, is regulated by the Autorité de Contrôle
Prudentiel et de Résolution and the Autorité des
Marchés Financiers, and is subject to certain
regulatory capital requirements. At December 31,
2020, BofASE's capital resources were $6.2
billion, which exceeded the minimum Pillar 1
requirement of $1.9 billion.

Liquidity Risk Funding and Liquidity Risk
Management Our primary liquidity risk management
objective is to meet expected or unexpected cash
flow and collateral needs while continuing to
support our businesses and customers under a
range of economic conditions. To achieve that
objective, we analyze and monitor our liquidity
risk under expected and stressed conditions,
maintain liquidity and access to diverse funding
sources, including our stable deposit base, and
seek to align liquidity-related incentives and
risks. These liquidity risk management practices
have allowed us to effectively manage the market
stress from the pandemic that began in the first
quarter of 2020. For more information on the
effects of the pandemic, see Part I. Item 1A.
Risk Factors – Coronavirus Disease on page 7 and
Executive Summary – Recent Developments –
COVID-19 Pandemic on page 25. We define liquidity
as readily available assets, limited to cash and
high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities
that we can use to meet our contractual and
contingent financial obligations as those
obligations arise. We manage our liquidity
position through line-of-business and ALM
activities, as well as through our legal entity
funding strategy, on both a forward and current
(including intraday) basis under both expected
and stressed conditions. We believe that a
centralized approach to funding and liquidity
management enhances our ability to monitor
liquidity requirements, maximizes access to
funding sources, minimizes borrowing costs and
facilitates timely responses to liquidity events.
The Board approves our liquidity risk policy and
the Financial Contingency and Recovery Plan. The
ERC establishes our liquidity risk tolerance
levels. The MRC is responsible for overseeing
liquidity risks and directing management to
maintain exposures within the established
tolerance levels. The MRC reviews and monitors
our liquidity position and stress testing
results, approves certain liquidity risk limits
and reviews the impact of strategic decisions on
our liquidity. For more information, see Managing
Risk on page 47. Under this governance framework,
we have developed certain funding and liquidity
risk management practices which include:
maintaining liquidity at the parent company and
selected subsidiaries, including our bank
subsidiaries and other regulated entities;
determining what amounts of liquidity are
appropriate for these entities based on analysis
of debt maturities and other potential cash
outflows, including those that we may experience
during stressed market conditions; diversifying
funding sources, considering our asset profile
and legal entity structure; and performing
contingency planning. NB Holdings Corporation We
have intercompany arrangements with certain key
subsidiaries under which we transferred certain
assets of Bank of America Corporation, as the
parent company, which is a separate and distinct
legal entity from our bank and nonbank
subsidiaries, and agreed to transfer certain
additional parent company assets not needed to
satisfy anticipated near-term expenditures, to NB
Holdings Corporation, a wholly-owned holding
company subsidiary (NB Holdings). The parent
company is expected to continue to have access to
the same flow of dividends, interest and other
amounts of cash necessary to service its debt,
pay dividends and perform other obligations as it
would have had if it had not entered into these
arrangements and transferred any assets. In
consideration for the transfer of assets, NB
Holdings issued a subordinated note to the parent
company in a principal
amount equal to the value of the transferred
assets. The aggregate principal amount of the
note will increase by the amount of any future
asset transfers. NB Holdings also provided the
parent company with a committed line of credit
that allows the parent company to draw funds
necessary to service near-term cash needs. These
arrangements support our preferred single point
of entry resolution strategy, under which only
the parent company would be resolved under the
U.S. Bankruptcy Code. These arrangements include
provisions to terminate the line of credit,
forgive the subordinated note and require the
parent company to transfer its remaining
financial assets to NB Holdings if our projected
liquidity resources deteriorate so severely that
resolution of the parent company becomes
imminent. Global Liquidity Sources and Other
Unencumbered Assets We maintain liquidity
available to the Corporation, including the
parent company and selected subsidiaries, in the
form of cash and high-quality, liquid,
unencumbered securities. Our liquidity buffer,
referred to as Global Liquidity Sources (GLS), is
comprised of assets that are readily available to
the parent company and selected subsidiaries,
including holding company, bank and broker-dealer
subsidiaries, even during stressed market
conditions. Our cash is primarily on deposit with
the Federal Reserve Bank and, to a lesser extent,
central banks outside of the U.S. We limit the
composition of high-quality, liquid, unencumbered
securities to U.S. government securities, U.S.
agency securities, U.S. agency MBS and a select
group of non-U.S. government securities. We can
quickly obtain cash for these securities, even in
stressed conditions, through repurchase
agreements or outright sales. We hold our GLS in
legal entities that allow us to meet the
liquidity requirements of our global businesses,
and we consider the impact of potential
regulatory, tax, legal and other restrictions
that could limit the transferability of funds
among entities. Table 16 presents average GLS for
the three months ended December 31, 2020 and
2019.

(1) Nonbank includes Parent, NB Holdings and
other regulated entities. Our bank subsidiaries’
liquidity is primarily driven by deposit and
lending activity, as well as securities valuation
and net debt activity. Bank subsidiaries can also
generate incremental liquidity by pledging a
range of unencumbered loans and securities to
certain FHLBs and the Federal Reserve Discount
Window. The cash we could have obtained by
borrowing against this pool of specifically-
identified eligible assets was $306 billion and
$372 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019. We
have established operational procedures to enable
us to borrow against these assets, including
regularly monitoring our total pool of eligible
loans and securities collateral. Eligibility is
defined in guidelines from the FHLBs and the
Federal Reserve and is subject to change at their
discretion. Due to regulatory restrictions,
liquidity generated by the bank subsidiaries can
generally be used only to fund obligations within
the bank subsidiaries, and transfers to the
parent company or nonbank subsidiaries may be
subject to prior regulatory approval.
 57Bank of America 
Liquidity is also held in nonbank entities,
including the Parent, NB Holdings and other
regulated entities. Parent company and NB
Holdings liquidity is typically in the form of
cash deposited at BANA and is excluded from the
liquidity at bank subsidiaries. Liquidity held in
other regulated entities, comprised primarily of
broker-dealer subsidiaries, is primarily
available to meet the obligations of that entity,
and transfers to the parent company or to any
other subsidiary may be subject to prior
regulatory approval due to regulatory
restrictions and minimum requirements. Our other
regulated entities also hold unencumbered
investment-grade securities and equities that we
believe could be used to generate additional
liquidity. Table 17 presents the composition of
average GLS for the three months ended December

Our GLS are substantially the same in composition to what qualifies as High Quality Liquid Assets
(HQLA) under the final U.S. Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) rules. However, HQLA for purposes of
calculating LCR is not reported at market value, but at a lower value that incorporates regulatory
deductions and the exclusion of excess liquidity held at certain subsidiaries. The LCR is calculated
as the amount of a financial institution’s unencumbered HQLA relative to the estimated net cash
outflows the institution could encounter over a 30-day period of significant liquidity stress,
expressed as a percentage. Our average consolidated HQLA, on a net basis, was $584 billion and $464
billion for the three months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. For the same periods, the average
consolidated LCR was 122 percent and 116 percent. Our LCR fluctuates due to normal business flows
from customer activity. Liquidity Stress Analysis We utilize liquidity stress analysis to assist us
in determining the appropriate amounts of liquidity to maintain at the parent company and our
subsidiaries to meet contractual and contingent cash outflows under a range of scenarios. The
scenarios we consider and utilize incorporate market-wide and Corporation-specific events, including
potential credit rating downgrades for the parent company and our subsidiaries, and more severe
events including potential resolution scenarios. The scenarios are based on our historical
experience, experience of distressed and failed financial institutions, regulatory guidance, and both
expected and unexpected future events. The types of potential contractual and contingent cash
outflows we consider in our scenarios may include, but are not limited to, upcoming contractual
maturities of unsecured debt and reductions in new debt issuances; diminished access to secured
financing markets; potential deposit withdrawals; increased draws on loan commitments, liquidity
facilities and letters of credit; additional collateral that counterparties could call if our credit
ratings were downgraded; collateral and margin requirements arising from market value changes; and
potential
liquidity required to maintain businesses and finance customer activities. Changes in certain market
factors, including, but not limited to, credit rating downgrades, could negatively impact potential
contractual and contingent outflows and the related financial instruments, and in some cases these
impacts could be material to our financial results. We consider all sources of funds that we could
access during each stress scenario and focus particularly on matching available sources with
corresponding liquidity requirements by legal entity. We also use the stress modeling results to
manage our asset and liability profile and establish limits and guidelines on certain funding sources
and businesses. Net Stable Funding Ratio Final Rule On October 20, 2020, the U.S. Agencies finalized
the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), a rule requiring large banks to maintain a minimum level of
stable funding over a one-year period. The final rule is intended to support the ability of banks to
lend to households and businesses in both normal and adverse economic conditions and is complementary
to the LCR rule, which focuses on short-term liquidity risks. The final rule is effective July 1,
2021. The U.S. NSFR would apply to the Corporation on a consolidated basis and to our insured
depository institutions. The Corporation expects to be in compliance within the final NSFR rule in
the regulatory timeline provided and does not expect any significant impacts to the Corporation.
Diversified Funding Sources We fund our assets primarily with a mix of deposits, and secured and
unsecured liabilities through a centralized, globally coordinated funding approach diversified across
products, programs, markets, currencies and investor groups. The primary benefits of our centralized
funding approach include greater control, reduced funding costs, wider name recognition by investors
and greater flexibility to meet the variable funding requirements of subsidiaries. Where regulations,
time zone differences or other business considerations make parent company funding impractical,
certain other subsidiaries may issue their own debt. We fund a substantial portion of our lending
activities through our deposits, which were $1.80 trillion and $1.43 trillion at December 31, 2020
and 2019. Deposits are primarily generated by our Consumer Banking , GWIM and Global Banking
segments. These deposits are diversified by clients, product type and geography, and the majority of
our U.S. deposits are insured by the FDIC. We consider a substantial portion of our deposits to be a
stable, low-cost and consistent source of funding. We believe this deposit funding is generally less
sensitive to interest rate changes, market volatility or changes in our credit ratings than wholesale
funding sources. Our lending activities may also be financed through secured borrowings, including
credit card securitizations and securitizations with government-sponsored enterprises (GSE), the FHA
and private-label investors, as well as FHLB loans. Our trading activities in other regulated
entities are primarily funded on a secured basis through securities lending and repurchase
agreements, and these amounts will vary based on customer activity and market conditions. We believe
funding these activities in the secured financing markets is more cost-efficient and less sensitive
to changes in our credit ratings than unsecured financing. Repurchase agreements are generally short-
term and often overnight. Disruptions in secured financing markets for financial institutions have
occurred in prior market cycles which resulted in adverse changes in terms or significant
 Bank of America58 
reductions in the availability of such financing.
We manage the liquidity risks arising from
secured funding by sourcing funding globally from
a diverse group of counterparties, providing a
range of securities collateral and pursuing
longer durations, when appropriate. For more
information on secured financing agreements, see
Note 10 – Federal Funds Sold or Purchased,
Securities Financing Agreements, Short-term
Borrowings and Restricted Cash to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.
Total long-term debt increased $22.1 billion to
$262.9 billion during 2020, primarily due to debt
issuances and valuation adjustments, partially
offset by maturities and redemptions. We may,
from time to time, purchase outstanding debt
instruments in various transactions, depending on
market conditions, liquidity and other factors.
Our other regulated entities may also make
markets in our debt instruments to provide
liquidity for investors.
During 2020, we issued $56.9 billion of long-term
debt consisting of $43.8 billion of notes issued
by Bank of America Corporation, substantially all
of which was TLAC compliant, $4.8 billion of
notes issued by Bank of America, N.A. and $8.3
billion of other debt. During 2019, we issued
$52.5 billion of long-term debt consisting of
$29.3 billion of notes issued by Bank of America
Corporation, substantially all of which was TLAC
compliant, $10.9 billion of notes issued by Bank
of America, N.A. and $12.3 billion of other debt.
During 2020, we had total long-term debt
maturities and redemptions in the aggregate of
$47.1 billion consisting of $22.6 billion for
Bank of America Corporation, $11.5 billion for
Bank of America, N.A. and $13.0 billion of other
debt. During 2019, we had total long-term debt
maturities and redemptions in the aggregate of
$50.6 billion consisting of $21.1 billion for
Bank of America Corporation, $19.9 billion for
Bank of America, N.A. and $9.6 billion of other
debt.
At December 31, 2020, Bank of America
Corporation's senior notes of $191.2 billion
included $146.6 billion of outstanding notes that
are both TLAC eligible and callable at least one
year before their stated maturities. Of these
senior notes, $12.0 billion will be callable and
become TLAC ineligible during 2021, and $15.3
billion, $14.6 billion, $11.7 billion and $13.2
billion will do so during each of 2022 through
2025, respectively, and $79.8 billion thereafter.
We issue long-term unsecured debt in a variety of
maturities and currencies to achieve cost-
efficient funding and to maintain an appropriate
maturity profile. While the cost and availability
of unsecured funding may be negatively impacted
by general market conditions or by matters
specific to the financial services industry or
the Corporation, we seek to mitigate refinancing
risk by actively managing the amount of our
borrowings that we anticipate will mature within
any month or quarter. We may issue unsecured debt
in the form of structured notes for client
purposes, certain of which qualify as TLAC-
eligible debt. During 2020, we issued $7.3
billion of structured notes, which are unsecured
debt obligations that pay investors returns
linked to other debt or equity securities,
indices, currencies or commodities. We typically
hedge the returns we are obligated to pay on
these liabilities with derivatives and/or
investments in the underlying instruments, so
that from a funding perspective, the cost is
similar to our other unsecured long-term debt. We
could be required to settle certain structured
note obligations for cash or other securities
prior to maturity under certain circumstances,
which we consider for liquidity planning
purposes. We believe, however, that a portion of
such borrowings will remain outstanding beyond
the earliest put or redemption date.
Substantially all of our senior and subordinated
debt obligations contain no provisions that could
trigger a requirement for an early repayment,
require additional collateral support, result in
changes to terms, accelerate maturity or create
additional financial obligations upon an adverse
change in our credit ratings, financial ratios,
earnings, cash flows or stock price. For more
information on long-term debt funding, including
issuances and maturities and redemptions, see
Note 11 – Long-term Debt to the Consolidated
Financial Statements .
We use derivative transactions to manage the
duration, interest rate and currency risks of our
borrowings, considering the characteristics of
the assets they are funding. For more information
on our ALM activities, see Interest Rate Risk
Management for the Banking Book on page 82.
 Contingency Planning 
We maintain contingency funding plans that
outline our potential responses to liquidity
stress events at various levels of severity.
These policies and plans are based on stress
scenarios and include potential funding
strategies and communication and notification
procedures that we would implement in the event
we experienced stressed liquidity conditions. We
periodically review and test the contingency
funding plans to validate efficacy and assess
readiness.
Our U.S. bank subsidiaries can access contingency
funding through the Federal Reserve Discount
Window. Certain non-U.S. subsidiaries have access
to central bank facilities in the jurisdictions
in which they operate. While we do not rely on
these sources in our liquidity modeling, we
maintain the policies, procedures and governance
processes that would enable us to access these
sources if necessary.
 Credit Ratings 
Our borrowing costs and ability to raise funds
are impacted by our credit ratings. In addition,
credit ratings may be important to customers or
counterparties when we compete in certain markets
and when we seek to engage in certain
transactions, including over-the-counter (OTC)
derivatives. Thus, it is our objective to
maintain high-quality credit ratings, and
management maintains an active dialogue with the
major rating agencies.
Credit ratings and outlooks are opinions
expressed by rating agencies on our
creditworthiness and that of our obligations or
securities, including long-term debt, short-term
borrowings, preferred stock and other securities,
including asset securitizations. Our credit
ratings are subject to ongoing review by the
rating agencies, and they consider a number of
factors, including our own financial strength,
performance, prospects and operations as well as
factors not under our control. The rating
agencies could make adjustments to our ratings at
any time, and they provide no assurances that
they will maintain our ratings at current levels.
Other factors that influence our credit ratings
include changes to the rating agencies’
methodologies for our industry or certain
security types; the rating agencies’ assessment
of the general operating environment for
financial services companies; our relative
positions in the markets in which we compete; our
various risk exposures and risk management
policies and activities; pending litigation and
other contingencies or potential tail risks; our
reputation; our liquidity position, diversity of
funding sources and funding costs; the current
and expected level and volatility of our
earnings; our capital position and capital
management practices; our corporate governance;
the sovereign credit ratings of the U.S.
government; current or future regulatory and
legislative
 59Bank of America 
initiatives; and the agencies’ views on whether
the U.S. government would provide meaningful
support to the Corporation or its subsidiaries in
a crisis.
On April 22, 2020, Fitch Ratings (Fitch)
completed its review of large, complex securities
trading and universal banks in the U.S.,
including Bank of America, in response to
declining economic activity from the pandemic.
The agency affirmed its long-term and short-term
senior debt ratings for the Corporation and all
of its rated subsidiaries, except for select
issuer and instrument-level ratings that had
previously been placed under criteria observation
on March 4, 2020, following changes in the
agency’s bank rating criteria on February 28,
2020.
Concurrently, Fitch reached a conclusion on
select under-criteria-observation designations
for the Corporation and upgraded its long-term
and short-term senior debt ratings of MLI and
BofASE by one notch to AA-/F1+. The agency also
upgraded its preferred stock rating for the
Corporation by one notch to BBB and downgraded
its subordinated debt rating for the Corporation
by one notch to A-. According to Fitch, rating
changes under criteria observation are the sole
result of bank rating criteria changes and do not
reflect a change in the underlying fundamentals
of the institution. Fitch’s outlook for all of
our long-term ratings is currently Stable.
On June 9, 2020, Fitch affirmed its rating for
the subordinated debt of BANA at A. This rating
had remained under criteria observation following
Fitch’s broader rating actions.
On November 18, 2020, Moody’s Investors Service
(Moody's) affirmed its long-term and short-term
debt ratings for the Corporation and all of its
rated subsidiaries, which did not change during
2020. Moody’s outlook for all of our long-term
ratings is currently Stable.
The current ratings and Stable outlooks for the
Corporation and its subsidiaries from Standard &
Poor’s Global Ratings also did not change during
2020.

term/short-term senior debt ratings and outlooks

A reduction in certain of our credit ratings or
the ratings of certain asset-backed
securitizations may have a material adverse
effect on our liquidity, potential loss of access
to credit markets, the related cost of funds, our
businesses and on certain revenues, particularly
in those businesses where counterparty
creditworthiness is critical. In addition, under
the terms of certain OTC derivative contracts and
other trading agreements, in the event of
downgrades of our or our rated subsidiaries’
credit ratings, the counterparties to those
agreements may require us to provide additional
collateral, or to terminate these contracts or
agreements, which could cause us to sustain
losses and/or adversely impact our liquidity. If
the short-term credit ratings of our parent
company, bank or broker-dealer subsidiaries were
downgraded by one or more levels, the potential
loss of access to short-term funding sources such
as repo financing and the effect on our
incremental cost of funds could be material.
While certain potential impacts are contractual
and quantifiable, the full scope of the
consequences of a credit rating downgrade to a
financial institution is inherently uncertain, as
it depends upon numerous dynamic, complex and
inter-related factors and assumptions, including
whether any downgrade of a company’s long-term
credit ratings precipitates downgrades to its
short-term credit ratings, and assumptions about
the potential behaviors of various customers,
investors and counterparties. For more
information on potential impacts of credit rating
downgrades, see Liquidity Risk – Liquidity Stress
Analysis on page 58.
For more information on additional collateral and
termination payments that could be required in
connection with certain over-the-counter
derivative contracts and other trading agreements
in the event of a credit rating downgrade, see

Financial Statements and Part I. Item 1A. Risk
Factors.

 Finance Subsidiary Issuers and Parent Guarantor 
BofA Finance LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company (BofA Finance), is a consolidated finance
subsidiary of the Corporation that has issued and
sold, and is expected to continue to issue and
sell, its senior unsecured debt securities
(Guaranteed Notes), that are fully and
unconditionally guaranteed by the Corporation.
The Corporation guarantees the due and punctual
payment, on demand, of amounts payable on the
Guaranteed Notes if not paid by BofA Finance. In
addition, each of BAC Capital Trust XIII and BAC
Capital Trust XIV, Delaware statutory trusts
(collectively, the Trusts), is a 100 percent
owned finance subsidiary of the Corporation that
has issued and sold trust preferred securities
(the Trust Preferred Securities and, together
with the Guaranteed Notes, the Guaranteed
Securities) that remained outstanding at December
31, 2020. The Corporation guarantees the payment
of amounts and distributions with respect to the
Trust Preferred Securities if not paid by the
Trusts, to the extent of funds held by the
Trusts, and this guarantee, together with the
Corporation’s other obligations with respect to
the Trust Preferred Securities, effectively
constitutes a full and unconditional guarantee of
the Trusts’ payment obligations on the Trust
Preferred Securities. No other subsidiary of the
Corporation guarantees the Guaranteed Securities.
BofA Finance and each of the Trusts are finance
subsidiaries, have no independent assets,
revenues or operations and are dependent upon the
Corporation and/or the Corporation’s other
subsidiaries to meet their respective obligations
under the Guaranteed Securities in the ordinary
course. If holders of the Guaranteed Securities
make claims on their Guaranteed Securities in a
bankruptcy, resolution or similar proceeding, any
recoveries on those claims will be limited to
those available under the applicable guarantee by
the Corporation, as described above.
The Corporation is a holding company and depends
upon its subsidiaries for liquidity. Applicable
laws and regulations and intercompany
arrangements entered into in connection with the
Corporation’s resolution plan could restrict the
availability of funds from subsidiaries to the
Corporation, which could adversely affect the
Corporation’s ability to make payments under its
guarantees. In addition, the obligations of the
Corporation under the guarantees of the
Guaranteed Securities will be structurally
subordinated to all existing and future
liabilities of its subsidiaries, and claimants
should look only to assets of the Corporation for
payments. If the Corporation, as guarantor of the
Guaranteed Notes, transfers all or substantially
all of its assets to one or more direct or
indirect majority-owned subsidiaries, under the
indenture governing the Guaranteed Notes, the
subsidiary or subsidiaries will not be required
to assume the Corporation’s obligations under its
guarantee of the Guaranteed Notes.
For more information on factors that may affect
payments to holders of the Guaranteed Securities,
see Liquidity Risk – NB Holdings Corporation in
this section, Item 1. Business – Insolvency and
the Orderly Liquidation Authority on page 5 and
Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors – Liquidity on page
9.
 Credit Risk Management 
Credit risk is the risk of loss arising from the
inability or failure of a borrower or
counterparty to meet its obligations. Credit risk
can also arise from operational failures that
result in an erroneous advance, commitment or
investment of funds. We define the credit
exposure to a borrower or counterparty as the
loss potential arising from all product
classifications including loans and leases,
deposit overdrafts, derivatives, assets held-for-
sale and unfunded lending commitments which
include loan commitments, letters of credit and
financial guarantees. Derivative positions are
recorded at fair value and assets held-for-sale
are recorded at either fair value or the lower of
cost or fair value. Certain loans and unfunded
commitments are accounted for under the fair
value option. Credit risk for categories of
assets carried at fair value is not accounted for
as part of the allowance for credit losses but as
part of the fair value adjustments recorded in
earnings. For derivative positions, our credit
risk is measured as the net cost in the event the
counterparties with contracts in which we are in
a gain position fail to perform under the terms
of those contracts. We use the current fair value
to represent credit exposure without giving
consideration to future mark-to-market changes.
The credit risk amounts take into consideration
the effects of legally enforceable master netting
agreements and cash collateral. Our consumer and
commercial credit extension and review procedures
encompass funded and unfunded credit exposures.
For more information on derivatives and credit
extension commitments, see Note 3 – Derivatives
and Note 12 – Commitments and Contingencies to
the Consolidated Financial Statements.
We manage credit risk based on the risk profile
of the borrower or counterparty, repayment
sources, the nature of underlying collateral, and
other support given current events, conditions
and expectations. We classify our portfolios as
either consumer or commercial and monitor credit
risk in each as discussed below.
We refine our underwriting and credit risk
management practices as well as credit standards
to meet the changing economic environment. To
mitigate losses and enhance customer support in
our consumer businesses, we have in place
collection programs and loan modification and
customer assistance infrastructures. We utilize a
number of actions to mitigate losses in the
commercial businesses including increasing the
frequency and intensity of portfolio monitoring,
hedging activity and our practice of transferring
management of deteriorating commercial exposures
to independent special asset officers as credits
enter criticized categories .
For information on our credit risk management
activities, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk
Management below, Commercial Portfolio Credit
Risk Management on page 68, Non-U.S. Portfolio on
page 74, Allowance for Credit Losses on page 76,
and Note 5 – Outstanding Loans and Leases and
Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.
During 2020, the pandemic negatively impacted
economic activity in the U.S. and around the
world. In particular, beginning in the latter
portion of the first quarter of 2020, the
pandemic resulted in changes to consumer and
business behaviors and restrictions on economic
activity. These restrictions gave rise to
increased unemployment and underemployment, lower
business profits, increased business closures and
bankruptcies, fluctuations and disruptions to
commercial and consumer spending and markets, and
lower global GDP, all of which negatively
impacted our consumer and commercial credit
portfolio.
 61Bank of America 
To provide relief to individuals and businesses
in the U.S., economic stimulus packages were
enacted throughout 2020, including the CARES Act,
an executive order signed in August 2020 to
establish the Lost Wage Assistance Program, and
most recently, the Consolidated Appropriations
Act enacted in December 2020. In addition, U.S.
bank regulatory agencies issued interagency
guidance to financial institutions that have
worked with and continue to work with borrowers
affected by COVID-19.
To support our customers, we implemented various
loan modification programs and other forms of
support beginning in March 2020, including
offering loan payment deferrals, refunding
certain fees, and pausing foreclosure sales,
evictions and repossessions. Since June 2020, we
have experienced a decline in the need for
customer assistance as the number of customer
accounts and balances on deferral decreased
significantly. For information on the accounting
for loan modifications related to the pandemic,
see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting
Principles to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.
Furthermore, as COVID-19 cases eased and initial
restrictions lifted, the global economy began to
improve. This improvement, coupled with the
aforementioned relief, facilitated economic
recovery, with unemployment dropping from double-
digit highs in the second quarter of 2020 and GDP
significantly rebounding in the third quarter of
2020.
However, economic recovery remains uneven, with
certain sectors of the economy more significantly
impacted from the pandemic (e.g., travel and
entertainment). As a result, we have experienced
increases in commercial reservable criticized
utilized exposures driven by industries most
heavily impacted by COVID-19. Also, we have seen
modest increases in nonperforming loans driven by
commercial loans and consumer real estate
customer deferral activities, though consumer
charge-offs remained low during 2020 due to
payment deferrals and government stimulus
benefits.
The pandemic and its full impact on the global
economy continue to be highly uncertain. While
COVID-19 cases have begun to ease from their
January 2021 peak, the spread of new, more
contagious variants could impact the magnitude
and duration of this health crisis. However,
ongoing virus containment efforts and vaccination
progress, as well as the possibility of further
government stimulus, could accelerate the
macroeconomic recovery. For more information on
how the pandemic may affect our operations, see
Executive Summary – Recent Developments –
COVID-19 Pandemic on page 25 and Part I. Item 1A.
Risk Factors – Coronavirus Disease on page 7.
 Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management 
Credit risk management for the consumer portfolio
begins with initial underwriting and continues
throughout a borrower’s credit cycle. Statistical
techniques in conjunction with experiential
judgment are used in all aspects of portfolio
management including underwriting, product
pricing, risk appetite, setting credit limits,
and establishing operating processes and metrics
to quantify and balance risks and returns.
Statistical models are built using detailed
behavioral information from external sources such
as credit bureaus and/or internal historical
experience and are a component of our consumer
credit risk management process. These models are
used in part to assist in making both new and
ongoing credit decisions, as well as portfolio
management strategies, including authorizations
and line management, collection practices and
strategies, and determination of the allowance
for loan and lease losses and allocated capital
for credit risk.
 Consumer Credit Portfolio 
While COVID-19 is severely impacting economic
activity, and is contributing to increasing
nonperforming loans within certain consumer
portfolios, it did not have a significant impact
on consumer portfolio charge-offs during 2020 due
to payment deferrals and government stimulus
benefits. However, COVID-19 could lead to adverse
impacts to credit quality metrics in future
periods if negative economic conditions continue
or worsen. During 2020, net charge-offs decreased
$334 million to $2.7 billion primarily due to
lower credit card losses.
The consumer allowance for loan and lease losses
increased $5.5 billion in 2020 to $10.1 billion
due to the adoption of the new CECL accounting
standard and deterioration in the economic
outlook resulting from the impact of COVID-19.
For more information, see Allowance for Credit
Losses on page 76.
For more information on our accounting policies
regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status,
charge-offs, TDRs for the consumer portfolio, as
well as interest accrual policies and delinquency
status for loan modifications related to the
pandemic, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant
Accounting Principles and Note 5 – Outstanding
Loans and Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses

(1) Residential mortgage loans accruing past due 90 days or more are fully-insured loans. At December
31, 2020 and 2019, residential mortgage includes $537 million and $740 million of loans on which
interest had been curtailed by the FHA, and therefore were no longer accruing interest, although
principal was still insured, and $225 million and $348 million of loans on which interest was still
accruing.
(2) Outstandings primarily include auto and specialty lending loans and leases of $46.4 billion and
$50.4 billion, U.S. securities-based lending loans of $41.1 billion and $36.7 billion and non-U.S.
consumer loans of $3.0 billion and $2.8 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019.
(3) Consumer loans accounted for under the fair value option include residential mortgage loans of
$298 million and $257 million and home equity loans of $437 million and $337 million at December 31,
2020 and 2019. For more information on the fair value option, see Note 21 – Fair Value Option to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.
(4) Excludes consumer loans accounted for under the fair value option. At December 31, 2020 and 2019,
$11 million and $6 million of loans accounted for under the fair value option were past due 90 days
or more and not accruing interest.

Table 21 presents outstandings, nonperforming
balances, net charge-offs, allowance for credit
losses and provision for credit losses for the
core and non-core portfolios within the consumer
real estate portfolio. We categorize consumer
real estate loans as core and non-core based on
loan and customer characteristics such as
origination date, product type, loan-to value
(LTV), Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) score and
delinquency status consistent with our current
consumer and mortgage servicing strategy.
Generally, loans that were originated after
January 1, 2010, qualified under GSE underwriting
guidelines, or otherwise met our underwriting
guidelines in place in 2015
are characterized as core loans. All other loans
are generally characterized as non-core loans and
represent runoff portfolios. Core loans as
reported in Table 21 include loans held in the
Consumer Banking and GWIM segments, as well as
loans held for ALM activities in All Other .
As shown in Table 21, outstanding core consumer
real estate loans decreased $15.4 billion during
2020 driven by a decrease of $10.5 billion in
residential mortgage and a $4.9 billion decrease
in home equity.

(1) Outstandings and nonperforming loans exclude
loans accounted for under the fair value option.
Consumer loans accounted for under the fair value
option include residential mortgage loans of $298
million and $257 million and home equity loans of
$437 million and $337 million at December 31,
2020 and 2019. For more information, see Note 21
– Fair Value Option to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.
(2) The home equity non-core allowance is in a
negative position at December 31, 2020 as it
includes expected recoveries of amounts
previously charged off.
(3) Home equity allowance includes a reserve for
unfunded lending commitments of $137 million at
December 31, 2020.
We believe that the presentation of information
adjusted to exclude the impact of the fully-
insured loan portfolio and loans accounted for
under the fair value option is more
representative of the ongoing operations and
credit quality of the business. As a result, in
the following tables and discussions of the
residential mortgage and home equity portfolios,
we exclude loans accounted for under the fair
value option and provide information that
excludes the impact of the fully-insured loan
portfolio in certain credit quality statistics.
 Residential Mortgage 
The residential mortgage portfolio made up the
largest percentage of our consumer loan portfolio
at 52 percent of consumer loans and leases at
December 31, 2020. Approximately 52 percent of
the residential mortgage portfolio was in
Consumer Banking and 40 percent was in GWIM. The
remaining portion was in All Other and was
comprised of loans used in our overall ALM
activities, delinquent FHA loans
repurchased pursuant to our servicing agreements
with the Government National Mortgage Association
as well as loans repurchased related to our
representations and warranties.
Outstanding balances in the residential mortgage
portfolio decreased $12.6 billion in 2020 as both
loan sales and paydowns were partially offset by
originations.
At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the residential
mortgage portfolio included $11.8 billion and
$18.7 billion of outstanding fully-insured loans,
of which $2.8 billion and $11.2 billion had FHA
insurance, with the remainder protected by Fannie
Mae long-term standby agreements. The decline was
primarily driven by sales of loans with FHA
insurance during 2020.
Table 22 presents certain residential mortgage
key credit statistics on both a reported basis
and excluding the fully-insured loan portfolio.
The following discussion presents the residential
mortgage portfolio excluding the fully-insured
loan portfolio.

the Consolidated Financial Statements.
(2) Includes loans that are contractually current
which primarily consist of collateral-dependent
TDRs, including those that have been discharged
in Chapter 7 bankruptcy and loans that have not
yet demonstrated a sustained period of payment
performance following a TDR.
(3) These vintages of loans accounted for $503
million and $365 million, or 25 percent, of
nonperforming residential mortgage loans at both
December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Nonperforming outstanding balances in the
residential mortgage portfolio increased $535
million in 2020 primarily driven by COVID-19
deferral activity, as well as the inclusion of
certain loans that, upon adoption of the new
credit loss standard, became accounted for on an
individual basis, which previously had been
accounted for under a pool basis. Of the
nonperforming residential mortgage loans at
December 31, 2020, $892 million, or 45 percent,
were current on contractual payments. Loans
accruing past due 30 days or more decreased $72
million.
Net charge-offs increased $17 million to a net
recovery of $30 million in 2020 compared to a net
recovery of $47 million in 2019. This increase is
due largely to lower recoveries from the sales of
previously charged-off loans.
Of the $211.7 billion in total residential
mortgage loans outstanding at December 31, 2020,
as shown in Table 22, 27 percent were originated
as interest-only loans. The outstanding balance
of interest-only residential mortgage loans that
have entered the amortization period was $5.9
billion, or 10 percent, at December 31, 2020.
Residential mortgage loans that have entered the
amortization period generally have experienced a
higher rate of early stage delinquencies and
nonperforming status compared to the residential
mortgage portfolio as a whole. At December 31,
2020, $113 million, or two percent of outstanding
interest-only residential mortgages that had
entered
the amortization period were accruing past due 30
days or more compared to $1.2 billion, or less
than one percent, for the entire residential
mortgage portfolio. In addition, at December 31,
2020, $356 million, or six percent, of
outstanding interest-only residential mortgage
loans that had entered the amortization period
were nonperforming, of which $96 million were
contractually current, compared to $2.0 billion,
or one percent, for the entire residential
mortgage portfolio. Loans that have yet to enter
the amortization period in our interest-only
residential mortgage portfolio are primarily
well-collateralized loans to our wealth
management clients and have an interest-only
period of three to ten years. Approximately 98
percent of these loans that have yet to enter the
amortization period will not be required to make
a fully-amortizing payment until 2022 or later.
Table 23 presents outstandings, nonperforming
loans and net charge-offs by certain state
concentrations for the residential mortgage
portfolio. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana
Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) within
California represented 16 percent of outstandings
at both December 31, 2020 and 2019. In the New
York area, the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long
Island MSA made up 14 percent and 13 percent of
outstandings at December 31, 2020 and 2019.

 Home Equity 
At December 31, 2020, the home equity portfolio
made up eight percent of the consumer portfolio
and was comprised of home equity lines of credit
(HELOCs), home equity loans and reverse
mortgages. HELOCs generally have an initial draw
period of 10 years, and after the initial draw
period ends, the loans generally
convert to 15- or 20-year amortizing loans. We no
longer originate home equity loans or reverse
mortgages.
At December 31, 2020, 80 percent of the home
equity portfolio was in Consumer Banking , 12
percent was in All Other and the remainder of the
portfolio was primarily in GWIM . Outstanding
balances in the home equity portfolio decreased
 65Bank of America 
$5.9 billion in 2020 primarily due to paydowns
outpacing new originations and draws on existing
lines. Of the total home equity portfolio at
December 31, 2020 and 2019, $13.8 billion, or 40
percent, and $15.0 billion, or 37 percent, were
in first-lien positions. At December 31, 2020,
outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio
that were in a second-lien or more junior-lien
position and where we also held the first-lien
loan totaled
$5.9 billion, or 17 percent, of our total home
equity portfolio.
Unused HELOCs totaled $42.3 billion and $43.6
billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019. The HELOC
utilization rate was 43 percent and 46 percent at
December 31, 2020 and 2019.

see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting
Principles to the Consolidated Financial

(2) Accruing past due 30 days or more include $25
million and $30 million and nonperforming loans
include $88 million and $57 million of loans
where we serviced the underlying first lien at
December 31, 2020 and 2019.
(3) Includes loans that are contractually current
which primarily consist of collateral-dependent
TDRs, including those that have been discharged
in Chapter 7 bankruptcy, junior-lien loans where
the underlying first lien is 90 days or more past
due, as well as loans that have not yet
demonstrated a sustained period of payment
performance following a TDR.
(4) These vintages of loans accounted for 36
percent and 34 percent of nonperforming home
equity loans at December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Nonperforming outstanding balances in the home
equity portfolio increased $113 million during
2020 primarily driven by COVID-19 deferral
activity . Of the nonperforming home equity loans
at December 31, 2020, $259 million, or 40
percent, were current on contractual payments. In
addition, $237 million, or 36 percent, of
nonperforming home equity loans were 180 days or
more past due and had been written down to the
estimated fair value of the collateral, less
costs to sell. Accruing loans that were 30 days
or more past due decreased $32 million in 2020.
Net charge-offs increased $285 million to a net
recovery of $73 million in 2020 compared to a net
recovery of $358 million in 2019 as the prior-
year period included recoveries from non-core
home equity loan sales.
Of the $34.3 billion in total home equity
portfolio outstandings at December 31, 2020, as
shown in Table 24, 15 percent require interest-
only payments. The outstanding balance of HELOCs
that have reached the end of their draw period
and have entered the amortization period was $9.2
billion at December 31, 2020. The HELOCs that
have entered the amortization period have
experienced a higher percentage of early stage
delinquencies and nonperforming status when
compared to the HELOC portfolio as a whole. At
December 31, 2020, $121 million, or one percent
of outstanding HELOCs that had entered the
amortization period were accruing past due 30
days or more. In addition, at December 31, 2020,
$477 million, or five percent, were
nonperforming. Loans that have yet to enter the
amortization period in our interest-only
portfolio are primarily post-2008 vintages and
generally have better credit quality than the
previous vintages that had entered the
amortization period. We communicate to
contractually current customers more than a year
prior to the end of their draw period to inform
them of the potential change to the payment
structure before entering the amortization
period, and provide payment options to customers
prior to the end of the draw period.
Although we do not actively track how many of our
home equity customers pay only the minimum amount
due on their home equity loans and lines, we can
infer some of this information through a review
of our HELOC portfolio that we service and that
is still in its revolving period. During 2020,
nine percent of these customers with an
outstanding balance did not pay any principal on
their HELOCs.
Table 25 presents outstandings, nonperforming
balances and net charge-offs by certain state
concentrations for the home equity portfolio. In
the New York area, the New York-Northern New
Jersey-Long Island MSA made up 13 percent of the
outstanding home equity portfolio at both
December 31, 2020 and 2019. The Los Angeles-Long
Beach-Santa Ana MSA within California made up 11
percent of the outstanding home equity portfolio
at both December 31, 2020 and 2019.

 Credit Card 
At December 31, 2020, 97 percent of the credit
card portfolio was managed in Consumer Banking
with the remainder in GWIM . Outstandings in the
credit card portfolio decreased $18.9 billion in
2020 to $78.7 billion due to lower retail
spending and higher payments. Net charge-offs
decreased $599 million to $2.3 billion during
2020 compared to net charge-offs of $2.9 billion
in 2019 due to government stimulus benefits and
payment deferrals associated with COVID-19.
Credit card loans 30 days
or more past due and still accruing interest
decreased $346 million, and loans 90 days or more
past due and still accruing interest decreased
$139 million primarily due to government stimulus
benefits and declines in loan balances.
Unused lines of credit for credit card increased
to $342.4 billion at December 31, 2020 from
$336.9 billion in 2019.

 Direct/Indirect Consumer 
At December 31, 2020, 51 percent of the
direct/indirect portfolio was included in
Consumer Banking (consumer auto and recreational
vehicle lending) and 49 percent was included in
GWIM (principally securities-based lending
loans). Outstandings
in the direct/indirect portfolio increased $365
million in 2020 to $91.4 billion primarily due to
increases in securities-based lending offset by
lower originations in Auto.

Nonperforming Consumer Loans, Leases and
Foreclosed Properties Activity
Table 28 presents nonperforming consumer loans,
leases and foreclosed properties activity during
2020 and 2019. During 2020, nonperforming
consumer loans increased $672 million to $2.7
billion primarily driven by COVID-19 deferral
activity, as well as the inclusion of $144
million of certain loans that were previously
classified as purchased credit-impaired loans and
accounted for under a pool basis.
At December 31, 2020, $892 million, or 33 percent
of nonperforming loans were 180 days or more past
due and had been written down to their estimated
property value less costs to sell. In addition,
at December 31, 2020, $1.2 billion, or 45 percent
of nonperforming consumer loans were modified and
are now current after successful trial periods,
or are current
loans classified as nonperforming loans in
accordance with applicable policies.
Foreclosed properties decreased $106 million in
2020 to $123 million as the Corporation has
paused formal loan foreclosure proceedings and
foreclosure sales for occupied properties during
2020.
Nonperforming loans also include certain loans
that have been modified in TDRs where economic
concessions have been granted to borrowers
experiencing financial difficulties.
Nonperforming TDRs are included in Table 28. For
more information on our loan modification
programs offered in response to the pandemic,
most of which are not TDRs, see Executive Summary

(1) At December 31, 2020 and 2019, residential
mortgage TDRs deemed collateral dependent totaled
$1.4 billion and $1.2 billion, and included $1.0
billion and $748 million of loans classified as
nonperforming and $361 million and $468 million
of loans classified as performing.
(2) At December 31, 2020 and 2019, residential
mortgage performing TDRs include $1.5 billion and
$2.1 billion of loans that were fully-insured.
(3) At December 31, 2020 and 2019, home equity
TDRs deemed collateral dependent totaled $407
million and $442 million, and include $216
million and $209 million of loans classified as
nonperforming and $191 million and $233 million
of loans classified as performing.
In addition to modifying consumer real estate
loans, we work with customers who are
experiencing financial difficulty by modifying
credit card and other consumer loans. Credit card
and other consumer loan modifications generally
involve a reduction in the customer’s interest
rate on the account and placing the customer on a
fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months.
Modifications of credit card and other consumer
loans are made through programs utilizing direct
customer contact, but may also utilize external
programs. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, our
credit card and other consumer TDR portfolio was
$701 million and $679 million, of which $614
million and $570 million were current or less
than 30 days past due under the modified terms.
 Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management 
Credit risk management for the commercial
portfolio begins with an assessment of the credit
risk profile of the borrower or counterparty
based on an analysis of its financial position.
As part of the overall credit risk assessment,
our commercial credit exposures are assigned a
risk rating and are subject to approval based on
defined credit approval standards. Subsequent to
loan origination, risk ratings are monitored on
an ongoing basis, and if necessary, adjusted to
reflect changes in the financial condition, cash
flow, risk profile or outlook of a borrower or
counterparty. In making credit decisions, we
consider risk rating, collateral, country,
industry and single-name concentration limits
while also balancing these considerations with
the total
borrower or counterparty relationship. We use a
variety of tools to continuously monitor the
ability of a borrower or counterparty to perform
under its obligations. We use risk rating
aggregations to measure and evaluate
concentrations within portfolios. In addition,
risk ratings are a factor in determining the
level of allocated capital and the allowance for
credit losses.
As part of our ongoing risk mitigation
initiatives, we attempt to work with clients
experiencing financial difficulty to modify their
loans to terms that better align with their
current ability to pay. In situations where an
economic concession has been granted to a
borrower experiencing financial difficulty, we
identify these loans as TDRs. For more
information on our accounting policies regarding
delinquencies, nonperforming status and net
charge-offs for the commercial portfolio, see
Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting
Principles to the Consolidated Financial
Statements .
 Management of Commercial Credit Risk Concentrations 
Commercial credit risk is evaluated and managed
with the goal that concentrations of credit
exposure continue to be aligned with our risk
appetite. We review, measure and manage
concentrations of credit exposure by industry,
product, geography, customer relationship and
loan size. We also review, measure and manage
commercial real estate loans by geographic
location and property type. In addition, within
our
 Bank of America68 
non-U.S. portfolio, we evaluate exposures by
region and by country. Tables 34, 37 and 40
summarize our concentrations. We also utilize
syndications of exposure to third parties, loan
sales, hedging and other risk mitigation
techniques to manage the size and risk profile of
the commercial credit portfolio. For more
information on our industry concentrations, see
Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management –
Industry Concentrations on page 72 and Table 37.
We account for certain large corporate loans and
loan commitments, including issued but unfunded
letters of credit which are considered utilized
for credit risk management purposes, that exceed
our single-name credit risk concentration
guidelines under the fair value option. Lending
commitments, both funded and unfunded, are
actively managed and monitored, and as
appropriate, credit risk for these lending
relationships may be mitigated through the use of
credit derivatives, with our credit view and
market perspectives determining the size and
timing of the hedging activity. In addition, we
purchase credit protection to cover the funded
portion as well as the unfunded portion of
certain other credit exposures. To lessen the
cost of obtaining our desired credit protection
levels, credit exposure may be added within an
industry, borrower or counterparty group by
selling protection. These credit derivatives do
not meet the requirements for treatment as
accounting hedges. They are carried at fair value
with changes in fair value recorded in other
income.
In addition, we are a member of various
securities and derivative exchanges and
clearinghouses, both in the U.S. and other
countries. As a member, we may be required to pay
a pro-rata share of the losses incurred by some
of these organizations as a result of another
member default and under other loss scenarios.
For more information, see Note 12 – Commitments
and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.
 Commercial Credit Portfolio 
During 2020, commercial asset quality weakened as
a result of the economic impact from COVID-19.
However, there were also positive signs during
this period. The draws by large corporate
and commercial clients contributing to the $67.2
billion loan growth in the first quarter of 2020
have largely been repaid, as emergency or
contingent funding was no longer needed or
clients were able to access capital markets.
Additionally, as part of the CARES Act, we had
$22.7 billion of PPP loans outstanding with our
small business clients at December 31, 2020,
which are included in U.S. small business
commercial in the tables in this section. For
more information on PPP loans, see Note 1 –
Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to
the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Credit quality of commercial real estate
borrowers has begun to stabilize in many sectors
as certain economies have reopened. Certain
sectors, including hospitality and retail,
continue to be negatively impacted as a result of
COVID-19. Moreover, many real estate markets,
while improving, are still experiencing some
disruptions in demand, supply chain challenges
and tenant difficulties.
The commercial allowance for loan and lease
losses increased $3.9 billion during 2020 to $8.7
billion due to the deterioration in the economic
outlook resulting from the impact of COVID-19.
For more information, see Allowance for Credit
Losses on page 76.
Total commercial utilized credit exposure
decreased $15.0 billion during 2020 to $620.3
billion driven by lower loans and leases. The
utilization rate for loans and leases, SBLCs and
financial guarantees, and commercial letters of
credit, in the aggregate, was 57 percent at
December 31, 2020 and 58 percent at December 31,
2019.
Table 30 presents commercial credit exposure by
type for utilized, unfunded and total binding
committed credit exposure. Commercial utilized
credit exposure includes SBLCs and financial
guarantees and commercial letters of credit that
have been issued and for which we are legally
bound to advance funds under prescribed
conditions during a specified time period, and
excludes exposure related to trading account
assets. Although funds have not yet been
advanced, these exposure types are considered
utilized for credit risk management purposes.

 69Bank of America 
Outstanding commercial loans and leases decreased
$18.6 billion during 2020 primarily driven by
repayments due in part to reduced working capital
needs and a favorable capital markets
environment, partially offset by $22.7 billion of
PPP loans outstanding at December 31, 2020.
Nonperforming commercial loans increased $728
million across industries, and commercial
reservable criticized utilized exposure increased
$27.2 billion spread across several industries,
including travel and entertainment, as a result
of weaker economic conditions arising from
COVID-19. Table 31 presents our commercial loans

 Bank of America70 
 Commercial and Industrial 
Commercial and industrial loans include U.S.
commercial and non-U.S. commercial portfolios.
 U.S. Commercial 
At December 31, 2020, 65 percent of the U.S.
commercial loan portfolio, excluding small
business, was managed in Global Banking, 18
percent in Global Markets , 15 percent in GWIM
(generally business-purpose loans for high net
worth clients) and the remainder primarily in
Consumer Banking . U.S. commercial loans
decreased $18.3 billion during 2020 driven by
Global Banking . Reservable criticized utilized
exposure increased $13.1 billion, which was
spread across several industries, including
travel and entertainment, as a result of weaker
economic conditions arising from COVID-19.
 Non-U.S. Commercial 
At December 31, 2020, 79 percent of the non-U.S.
commercial loan portfolio was managed in Global
Banking and 21 percent in Global Markets .
Non-U.S. commercial loans decreased $14.5 billion
during 2020, primarily in Global Banking . For
information on the non-U.S. commercial portfolio,
see Non-U.S. Portfolio on page 74.
 Commercial Real Estate 
Commercial real estate primarily includes
commercial loans secured by non-owner-occupied
real estate and is dependent on the sale or lease
of the real estate as the primary source of
repayment. Outstanding loans declined by $2.3
billion during
2020 as paydowns exceeded new originations.
Reservable criticized utilized exposure increased
$9.1 billion to $10.2 billion from $1.1 billion,
or 16.42 and 1.75 percent of the commercial real
estate portfolio at December 31, 2020 and 2019,
due to downgrades driven by the impact of
COVID-19 across industries, primarily hotels.
Although we have observed property-level
improvements in a number of the most impacted
sectors, the length of time for recovery has been
slower than originally anticipated, which has
prompted additional downgrades. The portfolio
remains diversified across property types and
geographic regions. California represented the
largest state concentration at 23 percent and 24
percent of the commercial real estate portfolio
at December 31, 2020 and 2019. The commercial
real estate portfolio is predominantly managed in
Global Banking and consists of loans made
primarily to public and private developers, and
commercial real estate firms.
During 2020, we continued to see low default
rates and varying degrees of improvement in the
portfolio. We use a number of proactive risk
mitigation initiatives to reduce adversely rated
exposure in the commercial real estate portfolio,
including transfers of deteriorating exposures to
management by independent special asset officers
and the pursuit of loan restructurings or asset
sales to achieve the best results for our
customers and the Corporation.

 U.S. Small Business Commercial 
The U.S. small business commercial loan portfolio
is comprised of small business card loans and
small business loans primarily managed in
Consumer Banking, and includes $22.7 billion of
PPP loans outstanding at December 31, 2020.
Excluding PPP, credit card-related products were
50 percent and 52 percent of the U.S. small

Nonperforming loans do not include loans
accounted for under the fair value option. During
2020, nonperforming commercial loans and leases
increased $728 million to $2.2 billion, primarily
driven by the impact of COVID-19. At December 31,
2020, 84 percent of commercial nonperforming
loans, leases and foreclosed properties were
secured and 66 percent were
contractually current. Commercial nonperforming
loans were carried at 81 percent of their unpaid
principal balance before
consideration of the allowance for loan and lease
losses, as the carrying value of these loans has
been reduced to the estimated collateral value
less costs to sell.

 Industry Concentrations 
Table 37 presents commercial committed and
utilized credit exposure by industry and the
total net credit default protection purchased to
cover the funded and unfunded portions of certain
credit exposures. Our commercial credit exposure
is diversified across a broad range of
industries. Total commercial committed exposure
decreased $22.1 billion, or two percent, during
2020 to $1.0 trillion. The decrease in commercial
committed exposure was concentrated in the Global
commercial banks, Asset managers and funds,
Utilities, and Real estate industry sectors.
Decreases were partially offset by increased
exposure to the Finance companies and Automobiles
and components industry sectors.
Industry limits are used internally to manage
industry concentrations and are based on
committed exposure that is
determined on an industry-by-industry basis. A
risk management framework is in place to set and
approve industry limits as well as to provide
ongoing monitoring. The MRC oversees industry
limit governance.
Asset managers and funds, our largest industry
concentration with committed exposure of $101.5
billion, decreased $8.5 billion, or eight
percent, during 2020.
Real estate, our second largest industry
concentration with committed exposure of $92.4
billion, decreased $4.0 billion, or four percent,
during 2020. For more information on the
commercial real estate and related portfolios,
see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management –
Commercial Real Estate on page 71.
Capital goods, our third largest industry
concentration with committed exposure of $81.0
billion, remained flat during 2020.
 Bank of America72 
Given the widespread impact of the pandemic on
the U.S. and global economy, a number of
industries have been and will likely continue to
be adversely impacted. We continue to monitor all
industries, particularly higher risk industries
which are experiencing or could experience a more
significant impact to their financial condition.
The impact of the pandemic has also placed
significant stress on global demand for oil. Our
energy-
related committed exposure decreased $3.3
billion, or nine percent, during 2020 to $33.0
billion, driven by declines in exploration and
production, refining and marketing exposure,
energy equipment and services, partially offset
by an increase in our integrated client exposure.

 Risk Mitigation 
We purchase credit protection to cover the funded
portion as well as the unfunded portion of
certain credit exposures. To lower the cost of
obtaining our desired credit protection levels,
we may add credit exposure within an industry,
borrower or counterparty group by selling
protection.
At December 31, 2020 and 2019, net notional
credit default protection purchased in our credit
derivatives portfolio to hedge
our funded and unfunded exposures for which we
elected the fair value option, as well as certain
other credit exposures, was $4.2 billion and $3.3
billion. We recorded net losses of $240 million
in 2020 compared to net losses of $145 million in
2019 for these same positions. The gains and
losses on these instruments were offset by gains
and losses on the related exposures. The Value-
at-Risk (VaR) results for these exposures are
included in the fair value option portfolio
information in Table 44. For more information,
see Trading Risk Management on page 79.

NR is comprised of index positions held and any names that have not been rated. In addition to our
net notional credit default protection purchased to cover the funded and unfunded portion of certain
credit exposures, credit derivatives are used for market-making activities for clients and
establishing positions intended to profit from directional or relative value changes. We execute the
majority of our credit derivative trades in the OTC market with large, multinational financial
institutions, including broker-dealers and, to a lesser degree, with a variety of other investors.
Because these transactions are executed in the OTC market, we are subject to settlement risk. We are
also subject to credit risk in the event that these counterparties fail to perform under the terms of
these contracts. In order to properly reflect counterparty credit risk, we record counterparty credit
risk valuation adjustments on certain derivative assets, including our
purchased credit default protection. In most cases, credit derivative transactions are executed on a
daily margin basis. Therefore, events such as a credit downgrade, depending on the ultimate rating
level, or a breach of credit covenants would typically require an increase in the amount of
collateral required by the counterparty, where applicable, and/or allow us to take additional
protective measures such as early termination of all trades. For more information on credit
derivatives and counterparty credit risk valuation adjustments, see Note 3 – Derivatives to the
Consolidated Financial Statements. Non-U.S. Portfolio Our non-U.S. credit and trading portfolios are
subject to country risk. We define country risk as the risk of loss from unfavorable economic and
political conditions, currency fluctuations, social instability and changes in government policies. A
risk management framework is in place to measure, monitor and manage non-U.S. risk and exposures. In
addition to the direct risk of doing business in a country, we also are exposed to indirect country
risks (e.g., related to the collateral received on secured financing transactions or related to
client clearing activities). These indirect exposures are managed in the normal course of business
through credit, market and operational risk governance, rather than through country risk governance.
Table 40 presents our 20 largest non-U.S. country exposures at December 31, 2020. These exposures
accounted for 90 percent and 88 percent of our total non-U.S. exposure at December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Net country exposure for these 20 countries increased $21.2 billion in 2020. The majority of the
increase was due to higher deposits with central banks in Germany and Japan. Non-U.S. exposure is
presented on an internal risk management basis and includes sovereign and non-sovereign credit
exposure, securities and other investments issued by or domiciled in countries other than the U.S.
Funded loans and loan equivalents include loans, leases, and other extensions of credit and funds,
including letters of credit and due from placements. Unfunded commitments are the undrawn portion of
legally binding commitments related to loans and loan equivalents. Net counterparty exposure includes
the fair value of derivatives, including the counterparty risk associated with credit default swaps
(CDS), and secured financing transactions. Securities and other investments are carried at fair value
and long securities exposures are netted against short exposures with the same underlying issuer to,
but not below, zero. Net country exposure represents country exposure less hedges and credit default
protection purchased, net of credit default protection sold.

Our largest non-U.S. country exposure at December
31, 2020 was the U.K. with net exposure of $59.5
billion, which represents a $3.6 billion increase
from December 31, 2019. Our second largest
non-U.S. country exposure was Germany with net
exposure of $44.9 billion at December 31, 2020, a
$14.1 billion increase from December 31, 2019.
The increase in Germany was primarily driven by
an increase in deposits with the central bank.
In light of the global pandemic, we are
monitoring our non-U.S. exposure closely,
particularly in countries where restrictions on
certain activities, in an attempt to contain the
spread and impact of the virus, have affected and
will likely continue to adversely affect economic
activity. We are managing the impact to our
international business operations as part of our
overall response framework and are taking actions
to manage exposure carefully in impacted regions
while supporting the needs of our clients. The
magnitude and duration of the pandemic and its
full impact on the global economy continue to be
highly uncertain.
The impact of COVID-19 could have an adverse
impact on the global economy for a prolonged
period of time. For more information on how the
pandemic may affect our operations, see Executive
Summary – Recent Developments – COVID-19 Pandemic
on page 25 and Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors on

Table 41 presents countries that had total cross-
border exposure, including the notional amount of
cash loaned under secured financing agreements,
exceeding one percent of our total assets at
December 31, 2020. Local exposure, defined as
exposure booked in local offices of a respective
country with clients in the same country, is
excluded. At December 31, 2020, the U.K. and
France were the only countries where their
respective total cross-border exposures exceeded

 Allowance for Credit Losses 
On January 1, 2020, the Corporation adopted the
new accounting standard that requires the
measurement of the allowance for credit losses to
be based on management’s best estimate of
lifetime ECL inherent in the Corporation’s
relevant financial assets. Upon adoption of the
new accounting standard, the Corporation recorded
a net increase of $3.3 billion in the allowance
for credit losses which was comprised of a net
increase of $2.9 billion in the allowance for
loan and lease losses and an increase of $310
million in the reserve for unfunded lending
commitments. The net increase was primarily
driven by a $3.1 billion increase related to the
credit card portfolio.
The allowance for credit losses further increased
by $7.2 billion from January 1, 2020 to $20.7
billion at December 31, 2020, which included a
$5.0 billion reserve increase related to the
commercial portfolio and a $2.2 billion reserve
increase related to the consumer portfolio. The
increases were driven by deterioration in the
economic outlook resulting from the impact of
COVID-19.
The following table presents an allocation of the
allowance for credit losses by product type for
December 31, 2020, January 1, 2020 and December
31, 2019 (prior to the adoption of the CECL
accounting standard).

(1) Ratios are calculated as allowance for loan
and lease losses as a percentage of loans and
leases outstanding excluding loans accounted for
under the fair value option. Consumer loans
accounted for under the fair value option include
residential mortgage loans of $298 million at
December 31, 2020 and $257 million at January 1,
2020 and December 31, 2019 and home equity loans
of $437 million at December 31, 2020 and $337
million at January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2019.
Commercial loans accounted for under the fair
value option include U.S. commercial loans of
$2.9 billion, $5.1 billion and $4.7 billion at
December 31, 2020, January 1, 2020 and December
31, 2019, and non-U.S. commercial loans of $3.0
billion, $3.2 billion and $3.1 billion at
December 31, 2020, January 1, 2020 and December
31, 2019.
(2) Includes allowance for loan and lease losses
for U.S. small business commercial loans of $1.5
billion, $831 million and $523 million at
December 31, 2020, January 1, 2020 and December
31, 2019.
n/m = not meaningful
Net charge-offs for 2020 were $4.1 billion
compared to $3.6 billion in 2019 driven by
increases in commercial losses. The provision for
credit losses increased $7.7 billion to $11.3
billion during 2020 compared to 2019. The
allowance for credit losses included a reserve
build of $7.2 billion for 2020, excluding the
impact of the new accounting standard, primarily
due to the deterioration in the economic outlook
resulting from the impact of COVID-19 on both the
consumer and commercial portfolios. The provision
for credit losses for the consumer portfolio,
including unfunded lending commitments, increased
$2.0 billion to $4.9 billion during 2020 compared
to 2019. The provision for credit losses for the
commercial portfolio, including unfunded
lending commitments, increased $5.7 billion to
$6.5 billion during 2020 compared to 2019.
The following table presents a rollforward of the
allowance for credit losses, including certain
loan and allowance ratios for 2020, noting that
measurement of the allowance for credit losses
for 2019 was based on management’s estimate of
probable incurred losses. For more information on
the Corporation’s credit loss accounting policies
and activity related to the allowance for credit
losses, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant
Accounting Principles and Note 5 – Outstanding
Loans and Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses

 Market Risk Management 
Market risk is the risk that changes in market
conditions may adversely impact the value of
assets or liabilities, or otherwise negatively
impact earnings. This risk is inherent in the
financial instruments associated with our
operations, primarily within our Global Markets
segment. We are also exposed to these risks in
other areas of the Corporation (e.g., our ALM
activities). In the event of market stress, these
risks could have a material impact on our
results. For more information, see Interest Rate
Risk Management for the Banking Book on page 82.
We have been affected, and expect to continue to
be affected, by market stress resulting from the
pandemic that began in the first quarter of 2020.
For more information on the effects of the
pandemic, see Executive Summary – Recent
Developments – COVID-19 Pandemic on page 25.
Our traditional banking loan and deposit products
are non-trading positions and are generally
reported at amortized cost for assets or the
amount owed for liabilities (historical cost).
However, these positions are still subject to
changes in economic value based on varying market
conditions, with one of the primary risks being
changes in the levels of interest rates. The risk
of adverse changes in the economic value of our
non-trading positions arising from changes in
interest rates is managed through our ALM
activities. We have elected to account for
certain assets and liabilities under the fair
value option.
Our trading positions are reported at fair value
with changes reflected in income. Trading
positions are subject to various changes in
market-based risk factors. The majority of this
risk is generated by our activities in the
interest rate, foreign exchange, credit, equity
and commodities markets. In addition, the values
of assets and liabilities could change due to
market liquidity, correlations across markets and
expectations of market volatility. We seek to
manage these risk exposures by using a variety of
techniques that encompass a broad range of
financial instruments. The key risk management
techniques are discussed in more detail in the
Trading Risk Management section.
Global Risk Management is responsible for
providing senior management with a clear and
comprehensive understanding of the trading risks
to which we are exposed. These responsibilities
include ownership of market risk policy,
developing and maintaining quantitative risk
models, calculating aggregated risk measures,
establishing and monitoring position limits
consistent with risk appetite, conducting daily
reviews and analysis of trading inventory,
approving material risk exposures and fulfilling
regulatory requirements. Market risks that impact
businesses outside of Global Markets are
monitored and governed by their respective
governance functions.
Model risk is the potential for adverse
consequences from decisions based on incorrect or
misused model outputs and reports. Given that
models are used across the Corporation, model
risk impacts all risk types including credit,
market and operational risks. The Enterprise
Model Risk Policy defines model risk standards,
consistent with our risk framework and risk
appetite, prevailing regulatory guidance and
industry best practice. All models, including
risk management, valuation and regulatory capital
models, must meet certain validation criteria,
including effective challenge of the conceptual
soundness of the model, independent model testing
and ongoing monitoring through outcomes analysis
and benchmarking. The Enterprise Model Risk
Committee (EMRC), a subcommittee of the MRC,
oversees that model standards are consistent with
model risk requirements and monitors the
effective challenge in the model validation
process across the Corporation.
 Interest Rate Risk 
Interest rate risk represents exposures to
instruments whose values vary with the level or
volatility of interest rates. These instruments
include, but are not limited to, loans, debt
securities, certain trading-related assets and
liabilities, deposits, borrowings and
derivatives. Hedging instruments used to mitigate
these risks include derivatives such as options,
futures, forwards and swaps.
 Foreign Exchange Risk 
Foreign exchange risk represents exposures to
changes in the values of current holdings and
future cash flows denominated in currencies other
than the U.S. dollar. The types of instruments
exposed to this risk include investments in
non-U.S. subsidiaries, foreign currency-
denominated loans and securities, future cash
flows in foreign currencies arising from foreign
exchange transactions, foreign currency-
denominated debt and various foreign exchange
derivatives whose values fluctuate with changes
in the level or volatility of currency exchange
rates or non-U.S. interest rates. Hedging
instruments used to mitigate this risk include
foreign exchange options, currency swaps,
futures, forwards, and foreign currency-
denominated debt and deposits.
 Mortgage Risk 
Mortgage risk represents exposures to changes in
the values of mortgage-related instruments. The
values of these instruments are sensitive to
prepayment rates, mortgage rates, agency debt
ratings, default, market liquidity, government
participation and interest rate volatility. Our
exposure to these instruments takes several
forms. For example, we trade and engage in
market-making activities in a variety of mortgage
securities including whole loans, pass-through
certificates, commercial mortgages and
collateralized mortgage obligations including
collateralized debt obligations using mortgages
as underlying collateral. In addition, we
originate a variety of MBS, which involves the
accumulation of mortgage-related loans in
anticipation of eventual securitization, and we
may hold positions in mortgage securities and
residential mortgage loans as part of the ALM
portfolio. We also record MSRs as part of our
mortgage origination activities. Hedging
instruments used to mitigate this risk include
derivatives such as options, swaps, futures and
forwards as well as securities including MBS and
U.S. Treasury securities. For more information,
see Mortgage Banking Risk Management on page 84.
 Equity Market Risk 
Equity market risk represents exposures to
securities that represent an ownership interest
in a corporation in the form of domestic and
foreign common stock or other equity-linked
instruments. Instruments that would lead to this
exposure include, but are not limited to, the
following: common stock, exchange-traded funds,
American Depositary Receipts, convertible bonds,
listed equity options (puts and calls), OTC
equity options, equity total return swaps, equity
index futures and other equity derivative
products. Hedging instruments used to mitigate
this risk include options, futures, swaps,
convertible bonds and cash positions.
 Commodity Risk 
Commodity risk represents exposures to
instruments traded in the petroleum, natural gas,
power and metals markets. These instruments
consist primarily of futures, forwards, swaps and
options. Hedging instruments used to mitigate
this risk include
 Bank of America78 
options, futures and swaps in the same or similar
commodity product, as well as cash positions.
 Issuer Credit Risk 
Issuer credit risk represents exposures to
changes in the creditworthiness of individual
issuers or groups of issuers. Our portfolio is
exposed to issuer credit risk where the value of
an asset may be adversely impacted by changes in
the levels of credit spreads, by credit migration
or by defaults. Hedging instruments used to
mitigate this risk include bonds, CDS and other
credit fixed-income instruments.
 Market Liquidity Risk 
Market liquidity risk represents the risk that
the level of expected market activity changes
dramatically and, in certain cases, may even
cease. This exposes us to the risk that we will
not be able to transact business and execute
trades in an orderly manner which may impact our
results. This impact could be further exacerbated
if expected hedging or pricing correlations are
compromised by disproportionate demand or lack of
demand for certain instruments. We utilize
various risk mitigating techniques as discussed
in more detail in Trading Risk Management.
 Trading Risk Management 
To evaluate risks in our trading activities, we
focus on the actual and potential volatility of
revenues generated by individual positions as
well as portfolios of positions. Various
techniques and procedures are utilized to enable
the most complete understanding of these risks.
Quantitative measures of market risk are
evaluated on a daily basis from a single position
to the portfolio of the Corporation. These
measures include sensitivities of positions to
various market risk factors, such as the
potential impact on revenue from a one basis
point change in interest rates, and statistical
measures utilizing both actual and hypothetical
market moves, such as VaR and stress testing.
Periods of extreme market stress influence the
reliability of these techniques to varying
degrees. Qualitative evaluations of market risk
utilize the suite of quantitative risk measures
while understanding each of their respective
limitations. Additionally, risk managers
independently evaluate the risk of the portfolios
under the current market environment and
potential future environments.
VaR is a common statistic used to measure market
risk as it allows the aggregation of market risk
factors, including the effects of portfolio
diversification. A VaR model simulates the value
of a portfolio under a range of scenarios in
order to generate a distribution of potential
gains and losses. VaR represents the loss a
portfolio is not expected to exceed more than a
certain number of times per period, based on a
specified holding period, confidence level and
window of historical data. We use one VaR model
consistently across the trading portfolios and it
uses a historical simulation approach based on a
three-year window of historical data. Our primary
VaR statistic is equivalent to a 99 percent
confidence level, which means that for a VaR with
a one-day holding period, there should not be
losses in excess of VaR, on average, 99 out of
100 trading days.
Within any VaR model, there are significant and
numerous assumptions that will differ from
company to company. The accuracy of a VaR model
depends on the availability and quality of
historical data for each of the risk factors in
the portfolio. A VaR model may require additional
modeling assumptions for new products that do not
have the necessary historical market data or for
less liquid positions for which accurate daily
prices
are not consistently available. For positions
with insufficient historical data for the VaR
calculation, the process for establishing an
appropriate proxy is based on fundamental and
statistical analysis of the new product or less
liquid position. This analysis identifies
reasonable alternatives that replicate both the
expected volatility and correlation to other
market risk factors that the missing data would
be expected to experience.
VaR may not be indicative of realized revenue
volatility as changes in market conditions or in
the composition of the portfolio can have a
material impact on the results. In particular,
the historical data used for the VaR calculation
might indicate higher or lower levels of
portfolio diversification than will be
experienced. In order for the VaR model to
reflect current market conditions, we update the
historical data underlying our VaR model on a
weekly basis, or more frequently during periods
of market stress, and regularly review the
assumptions underlying the model. A minor portion
of risks related to our trading positions is not
included in VaR. These risks are reviewed as part
of our ICAAP. For more information regarding
ICAAP, see Capital Management on page 50.
Global Risk Management continually reviews,
evaluates and enhances our VaR model so that it
reflects the material risks in our trading
portfolio. Changes to the VaR model are reviewed
and approved prior to implementation and any
material changes are reported to management
through the appropriate management committees.
Trading limits on quantitative risk measures,
including VaR, are independently set by Global
Markets Risk Management and reviewed on a regular
basis so that trading limits remain relevant and
within our overall risk appetite for market
risks. Trading limits are reviewed in the context
of market liquidity, volatility and strategic
business priorities. Trading limits are set at
both a granular level to allow for extensive
coverage of risks as well as at aggregated
portfolios to account for correlations among risk
factors. All trading limits are approved at least
annually. Approved trading limits are stored and
tracked in a centralized limits management
system. Trading limit excesses are communicated
to management for review. Certain quantitative
market risk measures and corresponding limits
have been identified as critical in the
Corporation’s Risk Appetite Statement. These risk
appetite limits are reported on a daily basis and
are approved at least annually by the ERC and the
Board.
In periods of market stress, Global Markets
senior leadership communicates daily to discuss
losses, key risk positions and any limit
excesses. As a result of this process, the
businesses may selectively reduce risk.
Table 44 presents the total market-based
portfolio VaR which is the combination of the
total covered positions (and less liquid trading
positions) portfolio and the fair value option
portfolio. Covered positions are defined by
regulatory standards as trading assets and
liabilities, both on- and off-balance sheet, that
meet a defined set of specifications. These
specifications identify the most liquid trading
positions which are intended to be held for a
short-term horizon and where we are able to hedge
the material risk elements in a two-way market.
Positions in less liquid markets, or where there
are restrictions on the ability to trade the
positions, typically do not qualify as covered
positions. Foreign exchange and commodity
positions are always considered covered
positions, except for structural foreign currency
positions that are excluded with prior regulatory
approval. In addition, Table 44 presents our fair
value option portfolio, which includes
substantially all of the funded and unfunded
exposures for which we elect the fair value
option, and their corresponding hedges.
Additionally, market risk VaR for
 79Bank of America 
trading activities as presented in Table 44
differs from VaR used for regulatory capital
calculations due to the holding period being
used. The holding period for VaR used for
regulatory capital calculations is 10 days, while
for the market risk VaR presented below, it is
one day. Both measures utilize the same process
and methodology.
The total market-based portfolio VaR results in
Table 44 include market risk to which we are
exposed from all business segments, excluding
credit valuation adjustment (CVA), DVA and
related hedges. The majority of this portfolio is
within the Global Markets segment.
Table 44 presents year-end, average, high and low
daily trading VaR for 2020 and 2019 using a 99
percent confidence
level. The amounts disclosed in Table 44 and
Table 45 align to the view of covered positions
used in the Basel 3 capital calculations. Foreign
exchange and commodity positions are always
considered covered positions, regardless of
trading or banking treatment for the trade,
except for structural foreign currency positions
that are excluded with prior regulatory approval.
The annual average of total covered positions and
less liquid trading positions portfolio VaR
increased for 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due
to the impact of market volatility related to the
pandemic in the VaR look back period.

(1) The high and low for each portfolio may have
occurred on different trading days than the high
and low for the components. Therefore the impact
from less liquid exposures and the amount of
portfolio diversification, which is the
difference between the total portfolio and the
sum of the individual components, is not
relevant.
The graph below presents the daily covered
positions and less liquid trading positions
portfolio VaR for 2020, corresponding to the data
in Table 44. Peak VaR in mid-March 2020 was
driven by increased market realized volatility
and higher implied volatilities.
Additional VaR statistics produced within our
single VaR model are provided in Table 45 at the
same level of detail as in Table 44. Evaluating
VaR with additional statistics allows for an
increased understanding of the risks in the
portfolio as the historical market data used in
the VaR calculation does not necessarily follow a
predefined statistical distribution. Table 45
presents average trading VaR statistics at 99
percent and 95 percent confidence levels for 2020
and 2019. The increase in VaR for the 99 percent
confidence level for 2020 was primarily due to
COVID-19 related market volatility, which
impacted the 99 percent VaR average more severely
than the 95 percent VaR average.

 Backtesting 
The accuracy of the VaR methodology is evaluated
by backtesting, which compares the daily VaR
results, utilizing a one-day holding period,
against a comparable subset of trading revenue. A
backtesting excess occurs when a trading loss
exceeds the VaR for the corresponding day. These
excesses are evaluated to understand the
positions and market moves that produced the
trading loss with a goal to ensure that the VaR
methodology accurately represents those losses.
We expect the frequency of trading losses in
excess of VaR to be in line with the confidence
level of the VaR statistic being tested. For
example, with a 99 percent confidence level, we
expect one trading loss in excess of VaR every
100 days or between two to three trading losses
in excess of VaR over the course of a year. The
number of backtesting excesses observed can
differ from the statistically expected number of
excesses if the current level of market
volatility is materially different than the level
of market volatility that existed during the
three years of historical data used in the VaR
calculation.
The trading revenue used for backtesting is
defined by regulatory agencies in order to most
closely align with the VaR component of the
regulatory capital calculation. This revenue
differs from total trading-related revenue in
that it excludes revenue from trading activities
that either do not generate market risk or the
market risk cannot be included in VaR. Some
examples of the types of revenue excluded for
backtesting are fees, commissions, reserves, net
interest income and intra-day trading revenues.
We conduct daily backtesting on the VaR results
used for regulatory capital calculations as well
as the VaR results for key legal entities,
regions and risk factors. These results are
reported to senior market risk management. Senior
management regularly reviews and evaluates the
results of these tests.
During 2020, there were seven days where this
subset of trading revenue had losses that
exceeded our total covered portfolio VaR,
utilizing a one-day holding period.
 Total Trading-related Revenue 
Total trading-related revenue, excluding
brokerage fees, and CVA, DVA and funding
valuation adjustment gains (losses), represents
the total amount earned from trading positions,
including market-based net interest income, which
are taken in a diverse range of financial
instruments and markets. For more information on
fair value, see Note 20 – Fair Value Measurements
to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Trading-related revenue can be volatile and is
largely driven by general market conditions and
customer demand. Also, trading-related revenue is
dependent on the volume and type of transactions,
the level of risk assumed, and the volatility of
price and rate movements at any given time within
the ever-changing market environment. Significant
daily revenue by business is monitored and the
primary drivers of these are reviewed.
The following histogram is a graphic depiction of
trading volatility and illustrates the daily
level of trading-related revenue for 2020 and
2019. During 2020, positive trading-related
revenue was recorded for 98 percent of the
trading days, of which 87 percent were daily
trading gains of over $25 million, and the
largest loss was $90 million. This compares to
2019 where positive trading-related revenue was
recorded for 98 percent of the trading days, of
which 80 percent were daily trading gains of over
$25 million, and the largest loss was $35
million.
 Trading Portfolio Stress Testing 
Because the very nature of a VaR model suggests
results can exceed our estimates and it is
dependent on a limited historical window, we also
stress test our portfolio using scenario
analysis. This analysis estimates the change in
the value of our trading portfolio that may
result from abnormal market movements.
A set of scenarios, categorized as either
historical or hypothetical, are computed daily
for the overall trading portfolio and individual
businesses. These scenarios include shocks to
underlying market risk factors that may be well
beyond the shocks found in the historical data
used to calculate VaR. Historical scenarios
simulate the impact of the market moves that
occurred during a period of extended historical
market stress. Generally, a multi-week period
representing the most
 81Bank of America 
severe point during a crisis is selected for each
historical scenario. Hypothetical scenarios
provide estimated portfolio impacts from
potential future market stress events. Scenarios
are reviewed and updated in response to changing
positions and new economic or political
information. In addition, new or ad hoc scenarios
are developed to address specific potential
market events or particular vulnerabilities in
the portfolio. The stress tests are reviewed on a
regular basis and the results are presented to
senior management. Stress testing for the trading
portfolio is integrated with enterprise-wide
stress testing and incorporated into the limits
framework. The macroeconomic scenarios used for
enterprise-wide stress testing purposes differ
from the typical trading portfolio scenarios in
that they have a longer time horizon and the
results are forecasted over multiple periods for
use in consolidated capital and liquidity
planning. For more information, see Managing Risk
on page 47. Interest Rate Risk Management for the
Banking Book The following discussion presents
net interest income for banking book activities.
Interest rate risk represents the most
significant market risk exposure to our banking
book balance sheet. Interest rate risk is
measured as the potential change in net interest
income caused by movements in market interest
rates. Client-facing activities, primarily
lending and deposit-taking, create interest rate
sensitive positions on our balance sheet. We
prepare forward-looking forecasts of net interest
income. The baseline forecast takes into
consideration expected future business growth,
ALM positioning -and the direction of interest
rate movements as implied by the market-based
forward curve. We then measure and evaluate the
impact that alternative interest rate scenarios
have on the baseline forecast in order to assess
interest rate sensitivity under varied
conditions. The net interest income forecast is
frequently updated for changing assumptions and
differing outlooks based on economic trends,
market conditions and business strategies. Thus,
we continually monitor our balance sheet position
in order to maintain an acceptable level of
exposure to interest rate changes. The interest
rate scenarios that we analyze incorporate
balance sheet assumptions such as loan and
deposit growth and pricing, changes in funding
mix, product repricing, maturity characteristics
and investment securities premium amortization.
Our overall goal is to manage interest rate risk
so that movements in interest rates do not
significantly adversely affect earnings and
capital. Table 46 presents the spot and 12-month
forward rates used in our baseline forecasts at
December 31, 2020 and 2019.
 Table 46 Forward Rates December 31, 2020

 Spot rates 1.75 % 1.91 % 1.90 % 
 12-month forward rates 1.50 1.62 1.92 
Table 47 shows the pretax impact to forecasted
net interest income over the next 12 months from
December 31, 2020 and 2019 resulting from
instantaneous parallel and non-parallel
shocks to the market-based forward curve.
Periodically we evaluate the scenarios presented
so that they are meaningful in the context of the
current rate environment. The interest rate
scenarios also assume U.S. dollar rates are
floored at zero. During 2020, the asset
sensitivity of our balance sheet increased in
both up-rate and down-rate scenarios primarily
due to continued deposit growth invested in long-
term securities. We continue to be asset
sensitive to a parallel upward move in interest
rates with the majority of that impact coming
from the short end of the yield curve.
Additionally, higher interest rates impact the
fair value of debt securities and, accordingly,
for debt securities classified as AFS, may
adversely affect accumulated OCI and thus capital
levels under the Basel 3 capital rules. Under
instantaneous upward parallel shifts, the near-
term adverse impact to Basel 3 capital is reduced
over time by offsetting positive impacts to net
interest income. For more information on Basel 3,
see Capital Management – Regulatory Capital on
page 51.

The sensitivity analysis in Table 47 assumes that
we take no action in response to these rate
shocks and does not assume any change in other
macroeconomic variables normally correlated with
changes in interest rates. As part of our ALM
activities, we use securities, certain
residential mortgages, and interest rate and
foreign exchange derivatives in managing interest
rate sensitivity. The behavior of our deposits
portfolio in the baseline forecast and in
alternate interest rate scenarios is a key
assumption in our projected estimates of net
interest income. The sensitivity analysis in
Table 47 assumes no change in deposit portfolio
size or mix from the baseline forecast in
alternate rate environments. In higher rate
scenarios, any customer activity resulting in the
replacement of low-cost or non-interest-bearing
deposits with higher yielding deposits or market-
based funding would reduce our benefit in those
scenarios. Interest Rate and Foreign Exchange
Derivative Contracts Interest rate and foreign
exchange derivative contracts are utilized in our
ALM activities and serve as an efficient tool to
manage our interest rate and foreign exchange
risk. We use derivatives to hedge the variability
in cash flows or changes in fair value on our
balance sheet due to interest rate and foreign
exchange components. For more information on our
hedging
 Bank of America82 
activities, see Note 3 – Derivatives to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.
Our interest rate contracts are generally non-
leveraged generic interest rate and foreign
exchange basis swaps, options, futures and
forwards. In addition, we use foreign exchange
contracts, including cross-currency interest rate
swaps, foreign currency futures contracts,
foreign currency forward contracts and options to
mitigate the foreign exchange risk associated
with foreign currency-denominated assets and
liabilities.
Changes to the composition of our derivatives
portfolio during 2020 reflect actions taken for
interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk
management. The decisions to reposition our
derivatives portfolio are based on the current
assessment of economic and financial conditions
including the interest rate and foreign currency
environments, balance sheet composition and
trends, and the relative mix of our cash and
derivative positions.
We use interest rate derivative instruments to
hedge the variability in the cash flows of our
assets and liabilities and other forecasted
transactions (collectively referred to as cash
flow hedges). The net results on both open and
terminated cash flow hedge derivative instruments
recorded in accumulated OCI were a gain of $580
million and a loss of $496 million, on a pretax
basis, at December 31, 2020 and 2019. These gains
and losses are expected to be reclassified into
earnings in the same period as the hedged cash
flows affect earnings and will decrease income or
increase expense on the respective hedged
cash flows. Assuming no change in open cash flow
derivative hedge positions and no changes in
prices or interest rates beyond what is implied
in forward yield curves at December 31, 2020, the
after-tax net gains are expected to be
reclassified into earnings as follows: a gain of
$187 million within the next year, a gain of $358
million in years two through five, a loss of $59
million in years six through ten, with the
remaining loss of $50 million thereafter. For
more information on derivatives designated as
cash flow hedges, see Note 3 – Derivatives to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.
We hedge our net investment in non-U.S.
operations determined to have functional
currencies other than the U.S. dollar using
forward foreign exchange contracts that typically
settle in less than 180 days, cross-currency
basis swaps and foreign exchange options. We
recorded net after-tax losses on derivatives in
accumulated OCI associated with net investment
hedges which were offset by gains on our net
investments in consolidated non-U.S. entities at
December 31, 2020.
Table 48 presents derivatives utilized in our ALM
activities and shows the notional amount, fair
value, weighted-average receive-fixed and pay-
fixed rates, expected maturity and average
estimated durations of our open ALM derivatives
at December 31, 2020 and 2019. These amounts do
not include derivative hedges on our MSRs. During
2020, the fair value of receive-fixed interest
rate swaps increased while pay-fixed interest
swaps decreased, primarily driven by lower swap
rates on hedges of U.S. dollar long-term debt.

denominated interest rate swaps and $711 million in net foreign currency futures contracts. Foreign
exchange contracts of $(53.1) billion at December 31, 2019 were comprised of $29.0 billion in foreign
currency-denominated and cross-currency receive-fixed swaps, $(82.4) billion in net foreign currency
forward rate contracts, $(313) million in foreign currency-denominated interest rate swaps and $644
million in foreign currency futures contracts.

 Mortgage Banking Risk Management 
We originate, fund and service mortgage loans,
which subject us to credit, liquidity and
interest rate risks, among others. We determine
whether loans will be held for investment or held
for sale at the time of commitment and manage
credit and liquidity risks by selling or
securitizing a portion of the loans we originate.
Interest rate risk and market risk can be
substantial in the mortgage business. Changes in
interest rates and other market factors impact
the volume of mortgage originations. Changes in
interest rates also impact the value of interest
rate lock commitments (IRLCs) and the related
residential first mortgage loans held-for-sale
(LHFS) between the date of the IRLC and the date
the loans are sold to the secondary market. An
increase in mortgage interest rates typically
leads to a decrease in the value of these
instruments. Conversely, when there is an
increase in interest rates, the value of the MSRs
will increase driven by lower prepayment
expectations. Because the interest rate risks of
these hedged items offset, we combine them into
one overall hedged item with one combined
economic hedge portfolio consisting of derivative
contracts and securities.
During 2020, 2019 and 2018, we recorded gains of
$321 million, $291 million and $244 million
related to the change in fair value of the MSRs,
IRLCs and LHFS, net of gains and losses on the
hedge portfolio. For more information on MSRs,
see Note 20 – Fair Value Measurements to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.
 Compliance and Operational Risk Management 
Compliance risk is the risk of legal or
regulatory sanctions, material financial loss or
damage to the reputation of the Corporation
arising from the failure of the Corporation to
comply with the requirements of applicable laws,
rules, regulations and our internal policies and
procedures (collectively, applicable laws, rules
and regulations).
Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting
from inadequate or failed processes, people and
systems or from external
events. Operational risk may occur anywhere in
the Corporation, including third-party business
processes, and is not limited to operations
functions. Effects may extend beyond financial
losses and may result in reputational risk
impacts. Operational risk includes legal risk.
Additionally, operational risk is a component in
the calculation of total RWA used in the Basel 3
capital calculation. For more information on
Basel 3 calculations, see Capital Management on
page 50.
FLUs and control functions are first and foremost
responsible for managing all aspects of their
businesses, including their compliance and
operational risk. FLUs and control functions are
required to understand their business processes
and related risks and controls, including third-
party dependencies, the related regulatory
requirements, and monitor and report on the
effectiveness of the control environment. In
order to actively monitor and assess the
performance of their processes and controls, they
must conduct comprehensive quality assurance
activities and identify issues and risks to
remediate control gaps and weaknesses. FLUs and
control functions must also adhere to compliance
and operational risk appetite limits to meet
strategic, capital and financial planning
objectives. Finally, FLUs and control functions
are responsible for the proactive identification,
management and escalation of compliance and
operational risks across the Corporation.
Global Compliance and Operational Risk teams
independently assess compliance and operational
risk, monitor business activities and processes
and evaluate FLUs and control functions for
adherence to applicable laws, rules and
regulations, including identifying issues and
risks, determining and developing tests to be
conducted by the Enterprise Independent Testing
unit, and reporting on the state of the control
environment. Enterprise Independent Testing, an
independent testing function within IRM, works
with Global Compliance and Operational Risk, the
FLUs and control functions in the identification
of testing needs and test design, and is
accountable for test execution, reporting and
analysis of results.
 Bank of America84 
Corporate Audit provides independent assessment
and validation through testing of key compliance
and operational risk processes and controls
across the Corporation.
The Corporation's Global Compliance Enterprise
Policy and Operational Risk Management -
Enterprise Policy set the requirements for
reporting compliance and operational risk
information to executive management as well as
the Board or appropriate Board-level committees
in support of Global Compliance and Operational
Risk’s responsibilities for conducting
independent oversight of our compliance and
operational risk management activities. The Board
provides oversight of compliance risk through its
Audit Committee and the ERC, and operational risk
through the ERC.
A key operational risk facing the Corporation is
information security, which includes
cybersecurity. Cybersecurity risk represents,
among other things, exposure to failures or
interruptions of service or breaches of security,
including as a result of malicious technological
attacks, that impact the confidentiality,
availability or integrity of our, or third
parties' (including their downstream service
providers, the financial services industry and
financial data aggregators) operations, systems
or data, including sensitive corporate and
customer information. The Corporation manages
information security risk in accordance with
internal policies which govern our comprehensive
information security program designed to protect
the Corporation by enabling preventative,
detective and responsive measures to combat
information and cybersecurity risks. The Board
and the ERC provide cybersecurity and information
security risk oversight for the Corporation, and
our Global Information Security Team manages the
day-to-day implementation of our information
security program.
 Reputational Risk Management 
Reputational risk is the risk that negative
perceptions of the Corporation’s conduct or
business practices may adversely impact its
profitability or operations. Reputational risk
may result from many of the Corporation’s
activities, including those related to the
management of our strategic, operational,
compliance and credit risks.
The Corporation manages reputational risk through
established policies and controls in its
businesses and risk management processes to
mitigate reputational risks in a timely manner
and through proactive monitoring and
identification of potential reputational risk
events. If reputational risk events occur, we
focus on remediating the underlying issue and
taking action to minimize damage to the
Corporation’s reputation. The Corporation has
processes and procedures in place to respond to
events that give rise to reputational risk,
including educating individuals and organizations
that influence public opinion, implementing
external communication strategies to mitigate the
risk, and informing key stakeholders of potential
reputational risks. The Corporation’s
organization and governance structure provides
oversight of reputational risks, and reputational
risk reporting is provided regularly and directly
to management and the ERC, which provides primary
oversight of reputational risk. In addition, each
FLU has a committee, which includes
representatives from Compliance, Legal and Risk,
that is responsible for the oversight of
reputational risk. Such committees’ oversight
includes providing approval for business
activities that present elevated levels of
reputational risks.
 Climate Risk Management 
Climate-related risks are divided into two major
categories: (1) risks related to the transition
to a low-carbon economy, which may entail
extensive policy, legal, technology and market
changes, and (2) risks related to the physical
impacts of climate change, driven by extreme
weather events, such as hurricanes and floods, as
well as chronic longer-term shifts, such as
temperature increases and sea level rises. These
changes and events can have broad impacts on
operations, supply chains, distribution networks,
customers, and markets and are otherwise referred
to, respectively, as transition risk and physical
risk. The financial impacts of transition risk
can lead to and amplify credit risk. Physical
risk can also lead to increased credit risk by
diminishing borrowers’ repayment capacity or
collateral values.
As climate risk is interconnected with all key
risk types, we have developed and continue to
enhance processes to embed climate risk
considerations into our Risk Framework and risk
management programs established for strategic,
credit, market, liquidity, compliance,
operational and reputational risks. A key element
of how we manage climate risk is the Risk
Identification process through which climate and
other risks are identified across all FLUs and
control functions, prioritized in our risk
inventory and evaluated to determine estimated
severity and likelihood of occurrence. Once
identified, climate risks are assessed for
potential impacts and incorporated into the
design of macroeconomic scenarios to generate
loss forecasts and assess how climate-related
impacts could affect us and our clients.
Our governance framework establishes oversight of
climate risk practices and strategies by the
Board, supported by its Corporate Governance,
ESG, and Sustainability Committee, the ERC and
the Global Environmental, Social and Governance
Committee, a management-level committee comprised
of senior leaders across every major FLU and
control function. The Climate Risk Steering
Council oversees our climate risk management
practices, shapes our approach to managing
climate-related risks in line with our Risk
Framework and meets monthly. In 2020, the climate
risk management effort was bolstered through the
appointment of a Global Climate Risk Executive
who reports to the CRO, and establishment of a
new division within our Global Risk organization
to drive execution of the climate risk management
program with the support of FLUs, Technology &
Operations and Risk partners. For additional
information about climate risk, see the Bank of
America website (the content of which is not
incorporated by reference into this Annual Report
on Form 10-K).
 Complex Accounting Estimates 
Our significant accounting principles, as
described in Note 1 – Summary of Significant
Accounting Principles to the Consolidated
Financial Statements, are essential in
understanding the MD&A. Many of our significant
accounting principles require complex judgments
to estimate the values of assets and liabilities.
We have procedures and processes in place to
facilitate making these judgments.
The more judgmental estimates are summarized in
the following discussion. We have identified and
described the development of the variables most
important in the estimation processes that
involve mathematical models to derive the
estimates. In many cases, there are numerous
alternative judgments that could be used in the
process of determining the inputs to the models.
Where alternatives exist, we have used the
factors that we believe represent the most
reasonable value in developing the inputs. Actual
performance that differs from our estimates of
the key variables could materially impact our
results of operations. Separate from the possible
future impact to our results of operations from
input and model variables, the value of our
lending portfolio and market-sensitive assets and
 85Bank of America 
liabilities may change subsequent to the balance
sheet date, often significantly, due to the
nature and magnitude of future credit and market
conditions. Such credit and market conditions may
change quickly and in unforeseen ways and the
resulting volatility could have a significant,
negative effect on future operating results.
These fluctuations would not be indicative of
deficiencies in our models or inputs.
 Allowance for Credit Losses 
On January 1, 2020, the Corporation adopted the
new accounting standard that requires the
measurement of the allowance for credit losses,
which includes the allowance for loan and lease
losses and the reserve for unfunded lending
commitments, to be based on management’s best
estimate of lifetime ECL inherent in the
Corporation's relevant financial assets.
The Corporation's estimate of lifetime ECL
includes the use of quantitative models that
incorporate forward-looking macroeconomic
scenarios that are applied over the contractual
life of the loan portfolios, adjusted for
expected prepayments and borrower-controlled
extension options. These macroeconomic scenarios
include variables that have historically been key
drivers of increases and decreases in credit
losses. These variables include, but are not
limited to, unemployment rates, real estate
prices, gross domestic product and corporate bond
spreads. As any one economic outlook is
inherently uncertain, the Corporation leverages
multiple scenarios. The scenarios that are chosen
each quarter and the amount of weighting given to
each scenario depend on a variety of factors
including recent economic events, leading
economic indicators, views of internal and third-
party economists and industry trends.
The Corporation also includes qualitative
reserves to cover losses that are expected but,
in the Corporation's assessment, may not be
adequately reflected in the economic assumptions
described above. For example, factors the
Corporation considers include changes in lending
policies and procedures, business conditions, the
nature and size of the portfolio, portfolio
concentrations, the volume and severity of past
due loans and nonaccrual loans, the effect of
external factors such as competition and legal
and regulatory requirements, among others.
Further, the Corporation considers the inherent
uncertainty in quantitative models that are built
on historical data.
The allowance for credit losses can also be
impacted by unanticipated changes in asset
quality of the portfolio, such as increases in
risk rating downgrades in our commercial
portfolio, deterioration in borrower
delinquencies or credit scores in our credit card
portfolio or increases in LTVs in our consumer
real estate portfolio. In addition, while we have
incorporated our estimated impact of COVID-19
into our allowance for credit losses, the
ultimate impact of the pandemic is still unknown,
including how long economic activities will be
impacted and what effect the unprecedented levels
of government fiscal and monetary actions will
have on the economy and our credit losses.
As described above, the process to determine the
allowance for credit losses requires numerous
estimates and assumptions, some of which require
a high degree of judgment and are often
interrelated. Changes in the estimates and
assumptions can result in significant changes in
the allowance for credit losses. Our process for
determining the allowance for credit losses is
further discussed in Note 1 – Summary of
Significant Accounting Principles and Note 5 –
Outstanding Loans
and Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.
 Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
Under applicable accounting standards, we are
required to maximize the use of observable inputs
and minimize the use of unobservable inputs in
measuring fair value. We classify fair value
measurements of financial instruments and MSRs
based on the three-level fair value hierarchy in
the accounting standards.
The fair values of assets and liabilities may
include adjustments, such as market liquidity and
credit quality, where appropriate. Valuations of
products using models or other techniques are
sensitive to assumptions used for the significant
inputs. Where market data is available, the
inputs used for valuation reflect that
information as of our valuation date. Inputs to
valuation models are considered unobservable if
they are supported by little or no market
activity. In periods of extreme volatility,
lessened liquidity or in illiquid markets, there
may be more variability in market pricing or a
lack of market data to use in the valuation
process. In keeping with the prudent application
of estimates and management judgment in
determining the fair value of assets and
liabilities, we have in place various processes
and controls that include: a model validation
policy that requires review and approval of
quantitative models used for deal pricing,
financial statement fair value determination and
risk quantification; a trading product valuation
policy that requires verification of all traded
product valuations; and a periodic review and
substantiation of daily profit and loss reporting
for all traded products. Primarily through
validation controls, we utilize both broker and
pricing service inputs which can and do include
both market-observable and internally-modeled
values and/or valuation inputs. Our reliance on
this information is affected by our understanding
of how the broker and/or pricing service develops
its data with a higher degree of reliance applied
to those that are more directly observable and
lesser reliance applied to those developed
through their own internal modeling. For example,
broker quotes in less active markets may only be
indicative and therefore less reliable. These
processes and controls are performed
independently of the business. For more
information, see Note 20 – Fair Value
Measurements and Note 21 – Fair Value Option to
the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 Level 3 Assets and Liabilities 
Financial assets and liabilities, and MSRs, where
values are based on valuation techniques that
require inputs that are both unobservable and are
significant to the overall fair value measurement
are classified as Level 3 under the fair value
hierarchy established in applicable accounting
standards. The fair value of these Level 3
financial assets and liabilities and MSRs is
determined using pricing models, discounted cash
flow methodologies or similar techniques for
which the determination of fair value requires
significant management judgment or estimation.
Level 3 financial instruments may be hedged with
derivatives classified as Level 1 or 2;
therefore, gains or losses associated with Level
3 financial instruments may be offset by gains or
losses associated with financial instruments
classified in other levels of the fair value
hierarchy. The Level 3 gains and losses recorded
in earnings did not have a significant impact on
our liquidity or capital. We conduct a review of
our fair value hierarchy classifications on a
quarterly basis. Transfers into or out of Level 3
are made if the significant inputs used in the
financial models measuring the fair values of the
assets and
 Bank of America86 
liabilities became unobservable or observable,
respectively, in the current marketplace. For
more information on transfers into and out of
Level 3 during 2020, 2019 and 2018, see Note 20 –
Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.
 Accrued Income Taxes and Deferred Tax Assets 
Accrued income taxes, reported as a component of
either other assets or accrued expenses and other
liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet,
represent the net amount of current income taxes
we expect to pay to or receive from various
taxing jurisdictions attributable to our
operations to date. We currently file income tax
returns in more than 100 jurisdictions and
consider many factors, including statutory,
judicial and regulatory guidance, in estimating
the appropriate accrued income taxes for each
jurisdiction.
Net deferred tax assets, reported as a component
of other assets on the Consolidated Balance
Sheet, represent the net decrease in taxes
expected to be paid in the future because of net
operating loss (NOL) and tax credit carryforwards
and because of future reversals of temporary
differences in the bases of assets and
liabilities as measured by tax laws and their
bases as reported in the financial statements.
NOL and tax credit carryforwards result in
reductions to future tax liabilities, and many of
these attributes can expire if not utilized
within certain periods. We consider the need for
valuation allowances to reduce net deferred tax
assets to the amounts that we estimate are more
likely than not to be realized.
Consistent with the applicable accounting
guidance, we monitor relevant tax authorities and
change our estimates of accrued income taxes
and/or net deferred tax assets due to changes in
income tax laws and their interpretation by the
courts and regulatory authorities. These
revisions of our estimates, which also may result
from our income tax planning and from the
resolution of income tax audit matters, may be
material to our operating results for any given
period.
See Note 19 – Income Taxes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for a table of significant
tax attributes and additional information. For
more information, see page 16 under Part I. Item
1A. Risk Factors – Regulatory, Compliance and
Legal.
 Goodwill and Intangible Assets 
The nature of and accounting for goodwill and
intangible assets are discussed in Note 1 –
Summary of Significant Accounting Principles ,
and Note 7 – Goodwill and Intangible Assets to
the Consolidated Financial Statements.
We completed our annual goodwill impairment test
as of June 30, 2020. In performing that test, we
compared the fair value of each reporting unit to
its estimated carrying value as measured by
allocated equity. We estimated the fair value of
each reporting unit based on the income approach
(which utilizes the present value of cash flows
to estimate fair value) and the market multiplier
approach (which utilizes observable market prices
and metrics of peer companies to estimate fair
value).
Our discounted cash flows were generally based on
the Corporation’s three-year internal forecasts
with a long-term growth rate of 3.68 percent. Our
estimated cash flows considered the current
challenging global industry and market conditions
related to the pandemic, including the low
interest rate environment. The cash flows were
discounted using rates that ranged from 9 percent
to 12 percent, which were derived from a capital
asset pricing model that incorporates the risk
and uncertainty in the cash flow forecasts, the
financial markets and industries similar to each
of the reporting units.
Under the market multiplier approach, we
estimated the fair value of the individual
reporting units utilizing various market
multiples, primarily various pricing multiples,
from comparable publicly-traded companies in
industries similar to the reporting unit and then
factored in a control premium based upon observed
comparable premiums paid for change-in-control
transactions for financial institutions.
Based on the results of the test, we determined
that each reporting unit’s estimated fair value
exceeded its respective carrying value and that
the goodwill assigned to each reporting unit was
not impaired. The fair values of the reporting
units as a percentage of their carrying values
ranged from 109 percent to 213 percent. It
currently remains difficult to estimate the
future economic impacts related to the pandemic.
If economic and market conditions (both in the
U.S. and internationally) deteriorate, our
reporting units could be negatively impacted,
which could change our key assumptions and
related estimates and may result in a future
impairment charge.

Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
The management of Bank of America Corporation is
responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial
reporting.
The Corporation’s internal control over financial
reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. The
Corporation’s internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures
that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records
that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the Corporation; (ii) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America, and that receipts and
expenditures of the Corporation are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the Corporation; and
(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the
Corporation’s assets that could have a material
effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or
that the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate.
Management assessed the effectiveness of the
Corporation’s internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2020 based on the
framework set forth by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission in Internal Control – Integrated
Framework (2013) . Based on that assessment,
management concluded that, as of December 31,
2020, the Corporation’s internal control over
financial reporting is effective.
The Corporation’s internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2020 has been
audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers , LLP , an
independent registered public accounting firm, as
stated in their accompanying report which
expresses an unqualified opinion on the
effectiveness of the Corporation’s internal
control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2020.

Report of Independent Registered Public
Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
Bank of America Corporation:
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal
Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Bank of America Corporation and
its subsidiaries (the “Corporation”) as of
December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the related
consolidated statements of income, comprehensive
income, changes in shareholders’ equity and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2020, including the related
notes (collectively referred to as the
“consolidated financial statements”). We also
have audited the Corporation's internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020,
based on criteria established in Internal Control
- Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of
the Corporation as of December 31, 2020 and 2019,
and the results of its operations and its cash
flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2020 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. Also in our opinion,
the Corporation maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2020,
based on criteria established in Internal Control
- Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.
Change in Accounting Principle
As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated
financial statements, the Corporation changed the
manner in which it accounts for credit losses on
certain financial instruments in 2020.
 Basis for Opinions 
The Corporation’s management is responsible for
these consolidated financial statements, for
maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting, and for its assessment of
the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting, included in the accompanying
Report of Management on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to
express opinions on the Corporation’s
consolidated financial statements and on the
Corporation's internal control over financial
reporting based on our audits. We are a public
accounting firm registered with the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States) (PCAOB) and are required to be
independent with respect to the Corporation in
accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws
and the applicable rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the
consolidated financial statements are free of
material misstatement, whether due to error or
fraud, and whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects. Our audits of the consolidated
financial statements included performing
procedures to assess the risks of material
misstatement of the consolidated financial
statements, whether due to error or fraud, and
performing procedures that respond to those
risks. Such procedures included examining, on a
test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and
disclosures in the consolidated financial
statements. Our audits also included evaluating
the
accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of the
consolidated financial statements. Our audit of
internal control over financial reporting
included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the
risk that a material weakness exists, and testing
and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control based on the
assessed risk. Our audits also included
performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control
over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial
reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. A company’s internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii)
provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation
of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and
that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations
of management and directors of the company; and
(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s
assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or
that the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate.
 Critical Audit Matters 
The critical audit matters communicated below are
matters arising from the current period audit of
the consolidated financial statements that were
communicated or required to be communicated to
the audit committee and that (i) relate to
accounts or disclosures that are material to the
consolidated financial statements and (ii)
involved our especially challenging, subjective,
or complex judgments. The communication of
critical audit matters does not alter in any way
our opinion on the consolidated financial
statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by
communicating the critical audit matters below,
providing separate opinions on the critical audit
matters or on the accounts or disclosures to
which they relate.
Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses - Commercial
and Consumer Card Loans
As described in Notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated
financial statements, the allowance for loan and
lease losses represents management’s estimate of
the expected credit losses in the Corporation’s
loan and lease portfolio, excluding loans and
unfunded lending commitments accounted for under
the fair value option. As of December 31, 2020,
the allowance for loan and lease losses was $18.8
billion on total loans and leases of $921.2
billion, which excludes loans accounted for under
the fair value option. For commercial and
consumer card loans, the expected credit loss is
estimated using quantitative methods
 95Bank of America 
that consider a variety of factors such as
historical loss experience, the current credit
quality of the portfolio as well as an economic
outlook over the life of the loan. In its loss
forecasting framework, the Corporation
incorporates forward looking information through
the use of macroeconomic scenarios applied over
the forecasted life of the assets. These
macroeconomic scenarios include variables that
have historically been key drivers of increases
and decreases in credit losses. These variables
include, but are not limited to, unemployment
rates, real estate prices, gross domestic product
levels and corporate bond spreads. The scenarios
that are chosen and the amount of weighting given
to each scenario depend on a variety of factors
including recent economic events, leading
economic indicators, views of internal as well as
third-party economists and industry trends. Also
included in the allowance for loan losses are
qualitative reserves to cover losses that are
expected but, in the Corporation's assessment,
may not be adequately reflected in the
quantitative methods or the economic assumptions.
Factors that the Corporation considers include
changes in lending policies and procedures,
business conditions, the nature and size of the
portfolio, portfolio concentrations, the volume
and severity of past due loans and nonaccrual
loans, the effect of external factors such as
competition, and legal and regulatory
requirements, among others. Further, the
Corporation considers the inherent uncertainty in
quantitative models that are built on historical
data.
The principal considerations for our
determination that performing procedures relating
to the allowance for loan and lease losses for
the commercial and consumer card portfolios is a
critical audit matter are (i) the significant
judgment and estimation by management in
developing lifetime economic forecast scenarios,
related weightings to each scenario and certain
qualitative reserves, which in turn led to a high
degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and
effort in performing procedures and in evaluating
audit evidence obtained, and (ii) the audit
effort involved professionals with specialized
skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating
certain audit evidence.
Addressing the matter involved performing
procedures and evaluating audit evidence in
connection with forming our overall opinion on
the consolidated financial statements. These
procedures included testing the effectiveness of
controls relating to the allowance for loan and
lease losses, including controls over the
evaluation and approval of models, forecast
scenarios and related weightings, and qualitative
reserves. These procedures also included, among
others, testing management’s process for
estimating the allowance for loan losses,
including (i) evaluating the appropriateness of
the loss forecast models and methodology, (ii)
evaluating the reasonableness of certain
macroeconomic variables, (iii) evaluating the
reasonableness of management’s development,
selection and weighting of economic forecast
scenarios used in the loss forecast models, (iv)
testing the completeness and accuracy of data
used in the estimate, and (v) evaluating certain
qualitative reserves made to the model output
results to determine the overall allowance for
loan losses. The procedures also included the
involvement of professionals with specialized
skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating the
appropriateness of certain loss forecast models,
the reasonableness of economic forecast scenarios
and related weightings and the reasonableness of
certain qualitative reserves.
Valuation of Certain Level 3 Financial
Instruments
As described in Notes 1 and 20 to the
consolidated financial statements, the
Corporation carries certain financial instruments
at fair value, which includes $10.0 billion of
assets and $7.4 billion of liabilities classified
as Level 3 fair value measurements on a recurring
basis and $1.7 billion of assets classified as
Level 3 fair value measurements on a nonrecurring
basis, for which the determination of fair value
requires significant management judgment or
estimation. The Corporation determines the fair
value of Level 3 financial instruments using
pricing models, discounted cash flow
methodologies, or similar techniques that require
inputs that are both unobservable and are
significant to the overall fair value
measurement. Unobservable inputs, such as
volatility or price, may be determined using
quantitative-based extrapolations or other
internal methodologies which incorporate
management estimates and available market
information.
The principal considerations for our
determination that performing procedures relating
to the valuation of certain Level 3 financial
instruments is a critical audit matter are the
significant judgment and estimation used by
management to determine the fair value of these
financial instruments, which in turn led to a
high degree of auditor judgment and effort in
performing procedures, including the involvement
of professionals with specialized skill and
knowledge to assist in evaluating certain audit
evidence.
Addressing the matter involved performing
procedures and evaluating audit evidence in
connection with forming our overall opinion on
the consolidated financial statements. These
procedures included testing the effectiveness of
controls relating to the valuation of financial
instruments, including controls related to
valuation models, significant unobservable
inputs, and data. These procedures also included,
among others, the involvement of professionals
with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in
developing an independent estimate of fair value
for a sample of these certain financial
instruments and comparison of management’s
estimate to the independently developed estimate
of fair value. Developing the independent
estimate involved testing the completeness and
accuracy of data provided by management and
evaluating the reasonableness of management’s
assumptions used to develop the significant
unobservable inputs.

 Bank of America Corporation and Subsidiaries 
 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
NOTE 1 Summary of Significant Accounting
Principles
Bank of America Corporation, a bank holding
company and a financial holding company, provides
a diverse range of financial services and
products throughout the U.S. and in certain
international markets. The term “the Corporation”
as used herein may refer to Bank of America
Corporation, individually, Bank of America
Corporation and its subsidiaries, or certain of
Bank of America Corporation’s subsidiaries or
affiliates. Principles of Consolidation and Basis
of Presentation The Consolidated Financial
Statements include the accounts of the
Corporation and its majority-owned subsidiaries
and those variable interest entities (VIEs) where
the Corporation is the primary beneficiary.
Intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated. Results of operations of acquired
companies are included from the dates of
acquisition, and for VIEs, from the dates that
the Corporation became the primary beneficiary.
Assets held in an agency or fiduciary capacity
are not included in the Consolidated Financial
Statements. The Corporation accounts for
investments in companies for which it owns a
voting interest and for which it has the ability
to exercise significant influence over operating
and financing decisions using the equity method
of accounting. These investments are included in
other assets. Equity method investments are
subject to impairment testing, and the
Corporation’s proportionate share of income or
loss is included in other income. The preparation
of the Consolidated Financial Statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect reported amounts and disclosures. Actual
results could materially differ from those
estimates and assumptions. Certain prior-period
amounts have been reclassified to conform to
current period presentation. New Accounting
Standards Accounting for Financial Instruments --
Credit Losses On January 1, 2020, the Corporation
adopted the new accounting standard that requires
the measurement of the allowance for credit
losses to be based on management’s best estimate
of lifetime expected credit losses (ECL) inherent
in the Corporation’s relevant financial assets.
Upon adoption of the standard on January 1, 2020,
the Corporation recorded a $ 3.3billion, or
32percent, increase to the allowance for credit
losses. After adjusting for deferred taxes and
other adoption effects, a $ 2.4billion decrease
was recorded in retained earnings through a
cumulative-effect adjustment. Prior to January 1,
2020, the allowance for credit losses was
determined based on management’s estimate of
probable incurred losses. Reference Rate Reform
The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
issued a new accounting standard in March 2020,
which was subsequently amended in January 2021,
related to contracts or hedging relationships
that reference London Interbank Offered Rate
(LIBOR) or other reference rates that are
expected to be discontinued due to reference rate
reform. The new standard provides for optional
expedients and other guidance regarding the
accounting related to modifications of contracts,
hedging
relationships and other transactions affected by
reference rate reform. The Corporation has
elected to retrospectively adopt the new standard
as of January 1, 2020. The adoption did not have
a material accounting impact on the Corporation’s
consolidated financial position or results of
operations; however, it did ease the
administrative burden in accounting for certain
effects of reference rate reform. Significant
Accounting Principles Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand,
cash items in the process of collection, cash
segregated under federal and other brokerage
regulations, and amounts due from correspondent
banks, the Federal Reserve Bank and certain
non-U.S. central banks. Certain cash balances are
restricted as to withdrawal or usage by legally
binding contractual agreements or regulatory
requirements. Securities Financing Agreements
Securities borrowed or purchased under agreements
to resell and securities loaned or sold under
agreements to repurchase (securities financing
agreements) are treated as collateralized
financing transactions except in instances where
the transaction is required to be accounted for
as individual sale and purchase transactions.
Generally, these agreements are recorded at
acquisition or sale price plus accrued interest,
except for securities financing agreements that
the Corporation accounts for under the fair value
option. Changes in the fair value of securities
financing agreements that are accounted for under
the fair value option are recorded in market
making and similar activities in the Consolidated
Statement of Income. The Corporation’s policy is
to monitor the market value of the principal
amount loaned under resale agreements and obtain
collateral from or return collateral pledged to
counterparties when appropriate. Securities
financing agreements do not create material
credit risk due to these collateral provisions;
therefore, an allowance for loan losses is not
necessary. In transactions where the Corporation
acts as the lender in a securities lending
agreement and receives securities that can be
pledged or sold as collateral, it recognizes an
asset on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair
value, representing the securities received, and
a liability, representing the obligation to
return those securities. Collateral The
Corporation accepts securities and loans as
collateral that it is permitted by contract or
practice to sell or repledge. At December 31,
2020 and 2019, the fair value of this collateral
was $ 812.4billion and $ 693.0billion, of which $
758.5billion and $ 593.8billion were sold or
repledged. The primary source of this collateral
is securities borrowed or purchased under
agreements to resell. The Corporation also
pledges company-owned securities and loans as
collateral in transactions that include
repurchase agreements, securities loaned, public
and trust deposits, U.S. Treasury tax and loan
notes, and short-term borrowings. This
collateral, which in some cases can be sold or
repledged by the counterparties to the
transactions, is parenthetically disclosed on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet. In certain cases, the
Corporation has transferred assets to
consolidated VIEs where those restricted assets
serve as collateral for the interests issued by
the VIEs. These assets are included on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet in Assets of
Consolidated VIEs.
 101Bank of America 
In addition, the Corporation obtains collateral in connection with its derivative contracts. Required
collateral levels vary depending on the credit risk rating and the type of counterparty. Generally,
the Corporation accepts collateral in the form of cash, U.S. Treasury securities and other marketable
securities. Based on provisions contained in master netting agreements, the Corporation nets cash
collateral received against derivative assets. The Corporation also pledges collateral on its own
derivative positions which can be applied against derivative liabilities. Trading Instruments
Financial instruments utilized in trading activities are carried at fair value. Fair value is
generally based on quoted market prices for the same or similar assets and liabilities. If these
market prices are not available, fair values are estimated based on dealer quotes, pricing models,
discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques where the determination of fair value may
require significant management judgment or estimation. Realized gains and losses are recorded on a
trade-date basis. Realized and unrealized gains and losses are recognized in market making and
similar activities. Derivatives and Hedging Activities Derivatives are entered into on behalf of
customers, for trading or to support risk management activities. Derivatives used in risk management
activities include derivatives that are both designated in qualifying accounting hedge relationships
and derivatives used to hedge market risks in relationships that are not designated in qualifying
accounting hedge relationships (referred to as other risk management activities). The Corporation
manages interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate sensitivity predominantly through the use of
derivatives. Derivatives utilized by the Corporation include swaps, futures and forward settlement
contracts, and option contracts. All derivatives are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at
fair value, taking into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements
that allow the Corporation to settle positive and negative positions and offset cash collateral held
with the same counterparty on a net basis. For exchange-traded contracts, fair value is based on
quoted market prices in active or inactive markets or is derived from observable market-based pricing
parameters, similar to those applied to over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives. For non-exchange traded
contracts, fair value is based on dealer quotes, pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies
or similar techniques for which the determination of fair value may require significant management
judgment or estimation. Valuations of derivative assets and liabilities reflect the value of the
instrument including counterparty credit risk. These values also take into account the Corporation’s
own credit standing. Trading Derivatives and Other Risk Management Activities Derivatives held for
trading purposes are included in derivative assets or derivative liabilities on the Consolidated
Balance Sheet with changes in fair value included in market making and similar activities.
Derivatives used for other risk management activities are included in derivative assets or derivative
liabilities. Derivatives used in other risk management activities have not been designated in
qualifying accounting hedge relationships because they did not qualify or the risk that is being
mitigated pertains to an item that is reported at fair value through earnings so that the effect of
measuring the derivative instrument and the asset or liability to which the risk exposure pertains
will offset in the Consolidated Statement of Income to the extent effective. The changes in the fair
value of derivatives that serve to mitigate certain risks associated with mortgage servicing rights
(MSRs), interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) and first-lien mortgage loans held-for-sale (LHFS)
that are originated by the Corporation are recorded in other income. Changes in the fair value of
derivatives that serve to mitigate interest rate risk and foreign currency risk are included in
market making and similar activities. Credit derivatives are also used by the Corporation to mitigate
the risk associated with various credit exposures. The changes in the fair value of these derivatives
are included in market making and similar activities and other income. Derivatives Used For Hedge
Accounting Purposes (Accounting Hedges) For accounting hedges, the Corporation formally documents at
inception all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as the risk
management objectives and strategies for undertaking various accounting hedges. Additionally, the
Corporation primarily uses regression analysis at the inception of a hedge and for each reporting
period thereafter to assess whether the derivative used in an accounting hedge transaction is
expected to be and has been highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of
a hedged item or forecasted transaction. The Corporation discontinues hedge accounting when it is
determined that a derivative is not expected to be or has ceased to be highly effective as a hedge,
and then reflects changes in fair value of the derivative in earnings after termination of the hedge
relationship. Fair value hedges are used to protect against changes in the fair value of the
Corporation’s assets and liabilities that are attributable to interest rate or foreign exchange
volatility. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recorded in
earnings, together and in the same income statement line item with changes in the fair value of the
related hedged item. If a derivative instrument in a fair value hedge is terminated or the hedge
designation removed, the previous adjustments to the carrying value of the hedged asset or liability
are subsequently accounted for in the same manner as other components of the carrying value of that
asset or liability. For interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, such adjustments
are amortized to earnings over the remaining life of the respective asset or liability. Cash flow
hedges are used primarily to minimize the variability in cash flows of assets and liabilities or
forecasted transactions caused by interest rate or foreign exchange rate fluctuations. The
Corporation also uses cash flow hedges to hedge the price risk associated with deferred compensation.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives used in cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive income (OCI) and are reclassified into the line item in the income statement in which
the hedged item is recorded in the same period the hedged item affects earnings. Components of a
derivative that are excluded in assessing hedge effectiveness are recorded in the same income
statement line item as the hedged item. Net investment hedges are used to manage the foreign exchange
rate sensitivity arising from a net investment in a foreign operation. Changes in the spot prices of
derivatives that are designated as net investment hedges of foreign operations are recorded as a
component of accumulated OCI. The remaining components of these derivatives are excluded in
 Bank of America102 
assessing hedge effectiveness and are recorded in market making and similar activities. Securities
Debt securities are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at their trade date. Their
classification is dependent on the purpose for which the securities were acquired. Debt securities
purchased for use in the Corporation’s trading activities are reported in trading account assets at
fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in market making and similar activities.
Substantially all other debt securities purchased are used in the Corporation’s asset and liability
management (ALM) activities and are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as either debt
securities carried at fair value or as held-to-maturity (HTM) debt securities. Debt securities
carried at fair value are either available-for-sale (AFS) securities with unrealized gains and losses
net-of-tax included in accumulated OCI or carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses
reported in market making and similar activities. HTM debt securities are debt securities that
management has the intent and ability to hold to maturity and are reported at amortized cost. The
Corporation evaluates each AFS security where the value has declined below amortized cost. If the
Corporation intends to sell or believes it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell
the debt security, it is written down to fair value through earnings. For AFS debt securities the
Corporation intends to hold, the Corporation evaluates the debt securities for ECL except for debt
securities that are guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury, U.S. government agencies or sovereign entities
of high credit quality where the Corporation applies a zero credit loss assumption. For the remaining
AFS debt securities, the Corporation considers qualitative parameters such as internal and external
credit ratings and the value of underlying collateral. If an AFS debt security fails any of the
qualitative parameters, a discounted cash flow analysis is used by the Corporation to determine if a
portion of the unrealized loss is a result of an expected credit loss. The Corporation will then
recognize either credit loss expense or a reversal of credit loss expense in other income for the
amount necessary to adjust the debt securities valuation allowance to its current estimate of
excepted credit losses. Cash flows expected to be collected are estimated using all relevant
information available such as remaining payment terms, prepayment speeds, the financial condition of
the issuer, expected defaults and the value of the underlying collateral. If any of the decline in
fair value is related to market factors, that amount is recognized in accumulated OCI. In certain
instances, the credit loss may exceed the total decline in fair value, in which case, the allowance
recorded is limited to the difference between the amortized cost and the fair value of the asset. The
Corporation separately evaluates its HTM debt securities for any credit losses, of which
substantially all qualify for the zero loss assumption. For the remaining securities, the Corporation
performs a discounted cash flow analysis to estimate any credit losses which are then recognized as
part of the allowance for credit losses. Interest on debt securities, including amortization of
premiums and accretion of discounts, is included in interest income. Premiums and discounts are
amortized or accreted to interest income at a constant effective yield over the contractual lives of
the securities. Realized gains and losses from the sales of debt securities are determined using the
specific identification method. Equity securities with readily determinable fair values that are not
held for trading purposes are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in
other income. Equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values are recorded at
cost less impairment, if any, plus or minus qualifying observable price changes. These securities are
reported in other assets. Loans and Leases Loans, with the exception of loans accounted for under the
fair value option, are measured at historical cost and reported at their outstanding principal
balances net of any unearned income, charge-offs, unamortized deferred fees and costs on originated
loans, and for purchased loans, net of any unamortized premiums or discounts. Loan origination fees
and certain direct origination costs are deferred and recognized as adjustments to interest income
over the lives of the related loans. Unearned income, discounts and premiums are amortized to
interest income using a level yield methodology. The Corporation elects to account for certain
consumer and commercial loans under the fair value option with interest reported in interest income
and changes in fair value reported in market making and similar activities or other income. Under
applicable accounting guidance, for reporting purposes, the loan and lease portfolio is categorized
by portfolio segment and, within each portfolio segment, by class of financing receivables. A
portfolio segment is defined as the level at which an entity develops and documents a systematic
methodology to determine the allowance for credit losses, and a class of financing receivables is
defined as the level of disaggregation of portfolio segments based on the initial measurement
attribute, risk characteristics and methods for assessing risk. The Corporation’s threeportfolio
segments are Consumer Real Estate, Credit Card and Other Consumer, and Commercial. The classes within
the Consumer Real Estate portfolio segment are residential mortgage and home equity . The classes
within the Credit Card and Other Consumer portfolio segment are credit card, direct/indirect consumer
and other consumer. The classes within the Commercial portfolio segment are U.S. commercial, non-U.S.
commercial, commercial real estate, commercial lease financing and U.S. small business commercial.
Leases The Corporation provides equipment financing to its customers through a variety of lessor
arrangements. Direct financing leases and sales-type leases are carried at the aggregate of lease
payments receivable plus the estimated residual value of the leased property less unearned income,
which is accreted to interest income over the lease terms using methods that approximate the interest
method. Operating lease income is recognized on a straight-line basis. The Corporation's lease
arrangements generally do not contain non-lease components. Allowance for Credit Losses The allowance
for credit losses includes both the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded
lending commitments and represents management’s estimate of the ECL in the Corporation’s loan and
lease portfolio, excluding loans and unfunded lending commitments accounted for under the fair value
option. The ECL on funded consumer and commercial loans and leases is referred to as the allowance
for loan and lease losses and is reported separately as a contra-asset to loans and leases on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet. The ECL for unfunded lending commitments, including home
 103Bank of America 
equity lines of credit (HELOCs), standby letters of credit (SBLCs) and binding unfunded loan
commitments is reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in accrued expenses and other liabilities.
The provision for credit losses related to the loan and lease portfolio and unfunded lending
commitments is reported in the Consolidated Statement of Income. For loans and leases, the ECL is
typically estimated using quantitative methods that consider a variety of factors such as historical
loss experience, the current credit quality of the portfolio as well as an economic outlook over the
life of the loan. The life of the loan for closed-ended products is based on the contractual maturity
of the loan adjusted for any expected prepayments. The contractual maturity includes any extension
options that are at the sole discretion of the borrower. For open-ended products (e.g., lines of
credit), the ECL is determined based on the maximum repayment term associated with future draws from
credit lines unless those lines of credit are unconditionally cancellable (e.g., credit cards) in
which case the Corporation does not record any allowance. In its loss forecasting framework, the
Corporation incorporates forward-looking information through the use of macroeconomic scenarios
applied over the forecasted life of the assets. These macroeconomic scenarios include variables that
have historically been key drivers of increases and decreases in credit losses. These variables
include, but are not limited to, unemployment rates, real estate prices, gross domestic product
levels and corporate bond spreads. As any one economic outlook is inherently uncertain, the
Corporation leverages multiple scenarios. The scenarios that are chosen each quarter and the
weighting given to each scenario depend on a variety of factors including recent economic events,
leading economic indicators, views of internal and third-party economists and industry trends. The
estimate of credit losses includes expected recoveries of amounts previously charged off (i.e.,
negative allowance). If a loan has been charged off, the expected cash flows on the loan are not
limited by the current amortized cost balance. Instead, expected cash flows can be assumed up to the
unpaid principal balance immediately prior to the charge-off. The allowance for loan and lease losses
for troubled debt restructurings (TDR) is measured based on the present value of projected future
lifetime principal and interest cash flows discounted at the loan’s original effective interest rate,
or in cases where foreclosure is probable or the loan is collateral dependent, at the loan’s
collateral value or its observable market price, if available. The measurement of ECL for the
renegotiated consumer credit card TDR portfolio is based on the present value of projected cash flows
discounted using the average TDR portfolio contractual interest rate, excluding promotionally priced
loans, in effect prior to restructuring. Projected cash flows for TDRs use the same economic outlook
as discussed above. For purposes of computing this specific loss component of the allowance, larger
impaired loans are evaluated individually and smaller impaired loans are evaluated as a pool. Also
included in the allowance for loan and lease losses are qualitative reserves to cover losses that are
expected but, in the Corporation's assessment, may not be adequately reflected in the quantitative
methods or the economic assumptions described above. For example, factors that the Corporation
considers include changes in lending policies and procedures, business conditions, the nature and
size of the portfolio, portfolio concentrations, the volume and severity of past due loans and
nonaccrual loans, the effect of external factors such as competition, and legal and regulatory
requirements, among others. Further, the Corporation considers the inherent uncertainty in
quantitative models that are built on historical data. With the exception of the Corporation's credit
card portfolio, the Corporation does not include reserves for interest receivable in the measurement
of the allowance for credit losses as the Corporation generally classifies consumer loans as
nonperforming at 90 days past due and reverses interest income for these loans at that time. For
credit card loans, the Corporation reserves for interest and fees as part of the allowance for loan
and lease losses. Upon charge-off of a credit card loan, the Corporation reverses the interest and
fee income against the income statement line item where it was originally recorded. The Corporation
has identified the following threeportfolio segments and measures the allowance for credit losses
using the following methods. Consumer Real Estate To estimate ECL for consumer loans secured by
residential real estate, the Corporation estimates the number of loans that will default over the
life of the existing portfolio, after factoring in estimated prepayments, using quantitative modeling
methodologies. The attributes that are most significant in estimating the Corporation’s ECL include
refreshed loan-to-value (LTV) or, in the case of a subordinated lien, refreshed combined LTV (CLTV),
borrower credit score, months since origination and geography, all of which are further broken down
by present collection status (whether the loan is current, delinquent, in default, or in bankruptcy).
The estimates are based on the Corporation’s historical experience with the loan portfolio, adjusted
to reflect the economic outlook. The outlook on the unemployment rate and consumer real estate prices
are key factors that impact the frequency and severity of loss estimates. The Corporation does not
reserve for credit losses on the unpaid principal balance of loans insured by the Federal Housing
Administration (FHA) and long-term standby loans, as these loans are fully insured. The Corporation
records a reserve for unfunded lending commitments for the ECL associated with the undrawn portion of
the Corporation’s HELOCs, which can only be canceled by the Corporation if certain criteria are met.
The ECL associated with these unfunded lending commitments is calculated using the same models and
methodologies noted above and incorporate utilization assumptions at time of default. For loans that
are more than 180 days past due and collateral-dependent TDRs, the Corporation bases the allowance on
the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral as of the reporting date less costs to sell.
The fair value of the collateral securing these loans is generally determined using an automated
valuation model (AVM) that estimates the value of a property by reference to market data including
sales of comparable properties and price trends specific to the Metropolitan Statistical Area in
which the property being valued is located. In the event that an AVM value is not available, the
Corporation utilizes publicized indices or if these methods provide less reliable valuations, the
Corporation uses appraisals or broker price opinions to estimate the fair value of the collateral.
While there is inherent imprecision in these valuations, the Corporation believes that they are
representative of this portfolio in the aggregate. For loans that are more than 180 days past due and
collateral-dependent TDRs, with the exception of the Corporation’s fully insured portfolio, the
outstanding balance of loans that is in excess of the estimated property value after
 Bank of America104 
adjusting for costs to sell is charged off. If the estimated property value decreases in periods
subsequent to the initial charge-off, the Corporation will record an additional charge-off; however,
if the value increases in periods subsequent to the charge-off, the Corporation will adjust the
allowance to account for the increase but not to a level above the cumulative charge-off amount.
Credit Cards and Other Consumer Credit cards are revolving lines of credit without a defined maturity
date. The estimated life of a credit card receivable is determined by estimating the amount and
timing of expected future payments (e.g., borrowers making full payments, minimum payments or
somewhere in between) that it will take for a receivable balance to pay off. The ECL on the future
payments incorporates the spending behavior of a borrower through time using key borrower-specific
factors and the economic outlook described above. The Corporation applies all expected payments in
accordance with the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (i.e.,
paying down the highest interest rate bucket first). Then forecasted future payments are prioritized
to pay off the oldest balance until it is brought to zero or an expected charge-off amount.
Unemployment rate outlook, borrower credit score, delinquency status and historical payment behavior
are all key inputs into the credit card receivable loss forecasting model. Future draws on the credit
card lines are excluded from the ECL as they are unconditionally cancellable. The ECL for the
consumer vehicle lending portfolio is also determined using quantitative methods supplemented with
qualitative analysis. The quantitative model estimates ECL giving consideration to key borrower and
loan characteristics such as delinquency status, borrower credit score, LTV ratio, underlying
collateral type and collateral value. Commercial The ECL on commercial loans is forecasted using
models that estimate credit losses over the loan’s contractual life at an individual loan level. The
models use the contractual terms to forecast future principal cash flows while also considering
expected prepayments. For open-ended commitments such as revolving lines of credit, changes in funded
balance are captured by forecasting a borrower’s draw and payment behavior over the remaining life of
the commitment. For loans collateralized with commercial real estate and for which the underlying
asset is the primary source of repayment, the loss forecasting models consider key loan and customer
attributes such as LTV ratio, net operating income and debt service coverage, and captures variations
in behavior according to property type and region. The outlook on the unemployment rate, gross
domestic product, and forecasted real estate prices are utilized to determine indicators such as rent
levels and vacancy rates, which impact the ECL estimate. For all other commercial loans and leases,
the loss forecasting model determines the probabilities of transition to different credit risk
ratings or default at each point over the life of the asset based on the borrower’s current credit
risk rating, industry sector, size of the exposure and the geographic market. The severity of loss is
determined based on the type of collateral securing the exposure, the size of the exposure, the
borrower’s industry sector, any guarantors and the geographic market. Assumptions of expected loss
are conditioned to the economic outlook, and the model considers key economic variables such as
unemployment rate, gross domestic product, corporate bond spreads, real estate and other asset prices
and equity market returns. In addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses, the Corporation
also estimates ECL related to unfunded lending commitments such as letters of credit, financial
guarantees, unfunded bankers acceptances and binding loan commitments, excluding commitments
accounted for under the fair value option. Reserves are estimated for the unfunded exposure using the
same models and methodologies as the funded exposure and are reported as reserves for unfunded
lending commitments. Nonperforming Loans and Leases, Charge-offs and Delinquencies Nonperforming
loans and leases generally include loans and leases that have been placed on nonaccrual status. Loans
accounted for under the fair value option and LHFS are not reported as nonperforming. In accordance
with the Corporation’s policies, consumer real estate-secured loans, including residential mortgages
and home equity loans, are generally placed on nonaccrual status and classified as nonperforming at
90days past due unless repayment of the loan is insured by the FHA or through individually insured
long-term standby agreements with Fannie Mae (FNMA) or Freddie Mac (FHLMC) (the fully-insured
portfolio). Residential mortgage loans in the fully-insured portfolio are not placed on nonaccrual
status and, therefore, are not reported as nonperforming. Junior-lien home equity loans are placed on
nonaccrual status and classified as nonperforming when the underlying first-lien mortgage loan
becomes 90days past due even if the junior-lien loan is current. The outstanding balance of real
estate-secured loans that is in excess of the estimated property value less costs to sell is charged
off no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180days past due unless the loan is
fully insured, or for loans in bankruptcy, within 60days of receipt of notification of filing, with
the remaining balance classified as nonperforming. Consumer loans secured by personal property,
credit card loans and other unsecured consumer loans are not placed on nonaccrual status prior to
charge-off and, therefore, are not reported as nonperforming loans, except for certain secured
consumer loans, including those that have been modified in a TDR. Personal property-secured loans
(including auto loans) are charged off to collateral value no later than the end of the month in
which the account becomes 120days past due, or upon repossession of an auto or, for loans in
bankruptcy, within 60days of receipt of notification of filing. Credit card and other unsecured
customer loans are charged off no later than the end of the month in which the account becomes
180days past due, within 60days after receipt of notification of death or bankruptcy, or upon
confirmation of fraud. Commercial loans and leases, excluding business card loans, that are past due
90days or more as to principal or interest, or where reasonable doubt exists as to timely collection,
including loans that are individually identified as being impaired, are generally placed on
nonaccrual status and classified as nonperforming unless well-secured and in the process of
collection. Business card loans are charged off in the same manner as consumer credit card loans.
Other commercial loans and leases are generally charged off when all or a portion of the principal
amount is determined to be uncollectible. The entire balance of a consumer loan or commercial loan or
lease is contractually delinquent if the minimum payment is not received by the specified due date on
the customer’s billing statement. Interest and fees continue to accrue on past due loans and leases
until the date the loan is placed on nonaccrual
 105Bank of America 
status, if applicable. Accrued interest receivable is reversed when loans and leases are placed on
nonaccrual status. Interest collections on nonaccruing loans and leases for which the ultimate
collectability of principal is uncertain are applied as principal reductions; otherwise, such
collections are credited to income when received. Loans and leases may be restored to accrual status
when all principal and interest is current and full repayment of the remaining contractual principal
and interest is expected. Troubled Debt Restructurings Consumer and commercial loans and leases whose
contractual terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower
experiencing financial difficulties are classified as TDRs. Concessions could include a reduction in
the interest rate to a rate that is below market on the loan, payment extensions, forgiveness of
principal, forbearance or other actions designed to maximize collections. Loans that are carried at
fair value and LHFS are not classified as TDRs. Loans and leases whose contractual terms have been
modified in a TDR and are current at the time of restructuring may remain on accrual status if there
is demonstrated performance prior to the restructuring and payment in full under the restructured
terms is expected. Otherwise, the loans are placed on nonaccrual status and reported as
nonperforming, except for fully-insured consumer real estate loans, until there is sustained
repayment performance for a reasonable period, generally six months. If accruing TDRs cease to
perform in accordance with their modified contractual terms, they are placed on nonaccrual status and
reported as nonperforming TDRs. Secured consumer loans that have been discharged in Chapter 7
bankruptcy and have not been reaffirmed by the borrower are classified as TDRs at the time of
discharge. Such loans are placed on nonaccrual status and written down to the estimated collateral
value less costs to sell no later than at the time of discharge. If these loans are contractually
current, interest collections are generally recorded in interest income on a cash basis. Consumer
real estate-secured loans for which a binding offer to restructure has been extended are also
classified as TDRs. Credit card and other unsecured consumer loans that have been renegotiated in a
TDR generally remain on accrual status until the loan is either paid in full or charged off, which
occurs no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180days past due or, for loans
that have been placed on a fixed payment plan, 120days past due. A loan that had previously been
modified in a TDR and is subsequently refinanced under current underwriting standards at a market
rate with no concessionary terms is accounted for as a new loan and is no longer reported as a TDR.
COVID-19 Programs The Corporation has implemented various consumer and commercial loan modification
programs to provide its borrowers relief from the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic (the
pandemic). In accordance with the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act), the
Corporation has elected to not apply TDR classification to eligible COVID-19 related loan
modifications that were performed after March 1, 2020 to loans that were current as of December 31,
2019. Accordingly, these restructurings are not classified as TDRs. The availability of this election
expires upon the earlier of January 1, 2022 or 60 days after the national emergency related to
COVID-19 terminates. In addition, for loans modified in response to the pandemic that do not meet the
above criteria (e.g., current payment status at December 31, 2019), the Corporation is applying the
guidance included in an interagency statement issued by the bank regulatory agencies. This guidance
states that loan modifications performed in light of the pandemic, including loan payment deferrals
that are up to six months in duration, that were granted to borrowers who were current as of the
implementation date of a loan modification program or modifications granted under government mandated
modification programs, are not TDRs. For loan modifications that include a payment deferral and are
not TDRs, the borrowers' past due and nonaccrual status have not been impacted during the deferral
period. The Corporation has continued to accrue interest during the deferral period using a constant
effective yield method. For most mortgage, HELOC and commercial loan modifications, the contractual
interest that accrued during the deferral period is payable at the maturity of the loan. The
Corporation includes these amounts with the unpaid principal balance when computing its allowance for
credit losses. Amounts that are subsequently deemed uncollectible are written off against the
allowance for credit losses. Loans Held-for-sale Loans that the Corporation intends to sell in the
foreseeable future, including residential mortgages, loan syndications, and to a lesser degree,
commercial real estate, consumer finance and other loans, are reported as LHFS and are carried at the
lower of aggregate cost or fair value. The Corporation accounts for certain LHFS, including
residential mortgage LHFS, under the fair value option. Loan origination costs for LHFS carried at
the lower of cost or fair value are capitalized as part of the carrying value of the loans and, upon
the sale of a loan, are recognized as part of the gain or loss in noninterest income. LHFS that are
on nonaccrual status and are reported as nonperforming, as defined in the policy herein, are reported
separately from nonperforming loans and leases. Premises and Equipment Premises and equipment are
carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are
recognized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Estimated
lives range up to 40years for buildings, up to 12years for furniture and equipment, and the shorter
of lease term or estimated useful life for leasehold improvements. Other Assets For the Corporation’s
financial assets that are measured at amortized cost and are not included in debt securities or loans
and leases on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Corporation evaluates these assets for ECL using
various techniques. For assets that are subject to collateral maintenance provisions, including
federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell, where the
collateral consists of daily margining of liquid and marketable assets where the margining is
expected to be maintained into the foreseeable future, the expected losses are assumed to be zero.
For all other assets, the Corporation performs qualitative analyses, including consideration of
historical losses and current economic conditions, to estimate any ECL which are then included in a
valuation account that is recorded as a contra-asset against the amortized cost basis of the
financial asset.
 Bank of America106 
Lessee Arrangements Substantially all of the Corporation’s lessee arrangements are operating leases.
Under these arrangements, the Corporation records right-of-use assets and lease liabilities at lease
commencement. Right-of-use assets are reported in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and
the related lease liabilities are reported in accrued expenses and other liabilities. All leases are
recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet except leases with an initial term less than 12 months for
which the Corporation made the short-term lease election. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-
line basis over the lease term and is recorded in occupancy and equipment expense in the Consolidated
Statement of Income. The Corporation made an accounting policy election not to separate lease and
non-lease components of a contract that is or contains a lease for its real estate and equipment
leases. As such, lease payments represent payments on both lease and non-lease components. At lease
commencement, lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the remaining lease
payments and discounted using the Corporation’s incremental borrowing rate. Right-of-use assets
initially equal the lease liability, adjusted for any lease payments made prior to lease commencement
and for any lease incentives. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill is the purchase premium after
adjusting for the fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed for
potential impairment on an annual basis, or when events or circumstances indicate a potential
impairment, at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is a business segment or one level below a
business segment. The Corporation assesses the fair value of each reporting unit against its carrying
value, including goodwill, as measured by allocated equity. For purposes of goodwill impairment
testing, the Corporation utilizes allocated equity as a proxy for the carrying value of its reporting
units. Allocated equity in the reporting units is comprised of allocated capital plus capital for the
portion of goodwill and intangibles specifically assigned to the reporting unit. In performing its
goodwill impairment testing, the Corporation first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether
it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value.
Qualitative factors include, among other things, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market
considerations, financial performance of the respective reporting unit and other relevant entity- and
reporting-unit specific considerations. If the Corporation concludes it is more likely than not that
the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative assessment is
performed. The Corporation has an unconditional option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any
reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative goodwill impairment
test. The Corporation may resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period. When
performing the quantitative assessment, if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying
value, goodwill of the reporting unit would not be considered impaired. If the carrying value of the
reporting unit exceeds its fair value, a goodwill impairment loss would be recognized for the amount
by which the reporting unit’s allocated equity exceeds its fair value. An impairment loss recognized
cannot exceed the amount of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit. An impairment loss establishes a
new basis in the goodwill, and subsequent reversals of goodwill impairment losses are not permitted
under applicable accounting guidance. For intangible assets subject to amortization, an impairment
loss is recognized if the carrying value of the intangible asset is not recoverable and exceeds fair
value. The carrying value of the intangible asset is considered not recoverable if it exceeds the sum
of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset. Intangible assets deemed
to have indefinite useful lives are not subject to amortization. An impairment loss is recognized if
the carrying value of the intangible asset with an indefinite life exceeds its fair value. Variable
Interest Entities A VIE is an entity that lacks equity investors or whose equity investors do not
have a controlling financial interest in the entity through their equity investments. The Corporation
consolidates a VIE if it has both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most
significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and an obligation to absorb losses or the right
to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. On a quarterly basis, the
Corporation reassesses its involvement with the VIE and evaluates the impact of changes in governing
documents and its financial interests in the VIE. The consolidation status of the VIEs with which the
Corporation is involved may change as a result of such reassessments. The Corporation primarily uses
VIEs for its securitization activities, in which the Corporation transfers whole loans or debt
securities into a trust or other vehicle. When the Corporation is the servicer of whole loans held in
a securitization trust, including non-agency residential mortgages, home equity loans, credit cards,
and other loans, the Corporation has the power to direct the most significant activities of the
trust. The Corporation generally does not have the power to direct the most significant activities of
a residential mortgage agency trust except in certain circumstances in which the Corporation holds
substantially all of the issued securities and has the unilateral right to liquidate the trust. The
power to direct the most significant activities of a commercial mortgage securitization trust is
typically held by the special servicer or by the party holding specific subordinate securities which
embody certain controlling rights. The Corporation consolidates a whole-loan securitization trust if
it has the power to direct the most significant activities and also holds securities issued by the
trust or has other contractual arrangements, other than standard representations and warranties, that
could potentially be significant to the trust. The Corporation may also transfer trading account
securities and AFS securities into municipal bond or resecuritization trusts. The Corporation
consolidates a municipal bond or resecuritization trust if it has control over the ongoing activities
of the trust such as the remarketing of the trust’s liabilities or, if there are no ongoing
activities, sole discretion over the design of the trust, including the identification of securities
to be transferred in and the structure of securities to be issued, and also retains securities or has
liquidity or other commitments that could potentially be significant to the trust. The Corporation
does not consolidate a municipal bond or resecuritization trust if one or a limited number of third-
party investors share responsibility for the design of the trust or have control over the significant
activities of the trust through liquidation or other substantive rights. Other VIEs used by the
Corporation include collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), investment vehicles created on behalf of
customers and other investment vehicles. The Corporation does not routinely serve as collateral
manager for CDOs and, therefore, does not typically have the power to direct the
 107Bank of America 
activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of a CDO. However, following an
event of default, if the Corporation is a majority holder of senior securities issued by a CDO and
acquires the power to manage its assets, the Corporation consolidates the CDO. The Corporation
consolidates a customer or other investment vehicle if it has control over the initial design of the
vehicle or manages the assets in the vehicle and also absorbs potentially significant gains or losses
through an investment in the vehicle, derivative contracts or other arrangements. The Corporation
does not consolidate an investment vehicle if a single investor controlled the initial design of the
vehicle or manages the assets in the vehicles or if the Corporation does not have a variable interest
that could potentially be significant to the vehicle. Retained interests in securitized assets are
initially recorded at fair value. In addition, the Corporation may invest in debt securities issued
by unconsolidated VIEs. Fair values of these debt securities, which are classified as trading account
assets, debt securities carried at fair value or HTM securities, are based primarily on quoted market
prices in active or inactive markets. Generally, quoted market prices for retained residual interests
are not available; therefore, the Corporation estimates fair values based on the present value of the
associated expected future cash flows. Fair Value The Corporation measures the fair values of its
assets and liabilities, where applicable, in accordance with accounting guidance that requires an
entity to base fair value on exit price. Under this guidance, an entity is required to maximize the
use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs in measuring fair value. Under
applicable accounting standards, fair value measurements are categorized into one of three levels
based on the inputs to the valuation technique with the highest priority given to unadjusted quoted
prices in active markets and the lowest priority given to unobservable inputs. The Corporation
categorizes its fair value measurements of financial instruments based on this three-level hierarchy.
Level 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 1
assets and liabilities include debt and equity securities and derivative contracts that are traded in
an active exchange market, as well as certain U.S. Treasury securities that are highly liquid and are
actively traded in OTC markets. Level 2 Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted
prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other
inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the
full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 2 assets and liabilities include debt securities with
quoted prices that are traded less frequently than exchange-traded instruments and derivative
contracts where fair value is determined using a pricing model with inputs that are observable in the
market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. This category
generally includes U.S. government and agency mortgage-backed (MBS) and asset-backed securities
(ABS), corporate debt securities, derivative contracts, certain loans and LHFS. Level 3 Unobservable
inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the overall
fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments
for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. The
fair value for such assets and liabilities is generally determined using pricing models, discounted
cash flow methodologies or similar techniques that incorporate the assumptions a market participant
would use in pricing the asset or liability. This category generally includes retained residual
interests in securitizations, consumer MSRs, certain ABS, highly structured, complex or long-dated
derivative contracts, certain loans and LHFS, IRLCs and certain CDOs where independent pricing
information cannot be obtained for a significant portion of the underlying assets. Income Taxes There
are two components of income tax expense: current and deferred. Current income tax expense reflects
taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period. Deferred income tax expense results from changes
in deferred tax assets and liabilities between periods. These gross deferred tax assets and
liabilities represent decreases or increases in taxes expected to be paid in the future because of
future reversals of temporary differences in the bases of assets and liabilities as measured by tax
laws and their bases as reported in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets are also recognized
for tax attributes such as net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. Valuation
allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts management concludes are more
likely than not to be realized. Income tax benefits are recognized and measured based upon a two-step
model: first, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained based solely on its
technical merits in order to be recognized, and second, the benefit is measured as the largest dollar
amount of that position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon settlement. The difference
between the benefit recognized and the tax benefit claimed on a tax return is referred to as an
unrecognized tax benefit. The Corporation records income tax-related interest and penalties, if
applicable, within income tax expense. Revenue Recognition The following summarizes the Corporation’s
revenue recognition accounting policies for certain noninterest income activities. Card Income Card
income includes annual, late and over-limit fees as well as interchange, cash advances and other
miscellaneous items from credit and debit card transactions and from processing card transactions for
merchants. Card income is presented net of direct costs. Interchange fees are recognized upon
settlement of the credit and debit card payment transactions and are generally determined on a
percentage basis for credit cards and fixed rates for debit cards based on the corresponding payment
network’s rates. Substantially all card fees are recognized at the transaction date, except for
certain time-based fees such as annual fees, which are recognized over 12 months. Fees charged to
cardholders and merchants that are estimated to be uncollectible are reserved in the allowance for
loan and lease losses. Included in direct cost are rewards and credit card partner payments. Rewards
paid to cardholders are related to points earned by the cardholder that can be redeemed for a broad
range of rewards including cash, travel and gift cards. The points to be redeemed are estimated based
on past redemption behavior, card product type, account
 Bank of America108 
transaction activity and other historical card performance. The liability is reduced as the points
are redeemed. The Corporation also makes payments to credit card partners. The payments are based on
revenue-sharing agreements that are generally driven by cardholder transactions and partner sales
volumes. As part of the revenue-sharing agreements, the credit card partner provides the Corporation
exclusive rights to market to the credit card partner’s members or customers on behalf of the
Corporation. Service Charges Service charges include deposit and lending-related fees. Deposit-
related fees consist of fees earned on consumer and commercial deposit activities and are generally
recognized when the transactions occur or as the service is performed. Consumer fees are earned on
consumer deposit accounts for account maintenance and various transaction-based services, such as ATM
transactions, wire transfer activities, check and money order processing and insufficient
funds/overdraft transactions. Commercial deposit-related fees are from the Corporation’s Global
Transaction Services business and consist of commercial deposit and treasury management services,
including account maintenance and other services, such as payroll, sweep account and other cash
management services. Lending-related fees generally represent transactional fees earned from certain
loan commitments, financial guarantees and SBLCs. Investment and Brokerage Services Investment and
brokerage services consist of asset management and brokerage fees. Asset management fees are earned
from the management of client assets under advisory agreements or the full discretion of the
Corporation’s financial advisors (collectively referred to as assets under management (AUM)). Asset
management fees are earned as a percentage of the client’s AUM and generally range from 50basis
points (bps) to 150bps of the AUM. In cases where a third party is used to obtain a client’s
investment allocation, the fee remitted to the third party is recorded net and is not reflected in
the transaction price, as the Corporation is an agent for those services. Brokerage fees include
income earned from transaction-based services that are performed as part of investment management
services and are based on a fixed price per unit or as a percentage of the total transaction amount.
Brokerage fees also include distribution fees and sales commissions that are primarily in the Global
Wealth & Investment Management ( GWIM ) segment and are earned over time. In addition, primarily in
the Global Markets segment, brokerage fees are earned when the Corporation fills customer orders to
buy or sell various financial products or when it acknowledges, affirms, settles and clears
transactions and/or submits trade information to the appropriate clearing broker. Certain customers
pay brokerage, clearing and/or exchange fees imposed by relevant regulatory bodies or exchanges in
order to execute or clear trades. These fees are recorded net and are not reflected in the
transaction price, as the Corporation is an agent for those services. Investment Banking Income
Investment banking income includes underwriting income and financial advisory services income.
Underwriting consists of fees earned for the placement of a customer’s debt or equity securities. The
revenue is generally earned based on a percentage of the fixed number of shares or principal placed.
Once the number of shares or notes is determined and the service is completed, the underwriting fees
are recognized. The Corporation incurs certain out-of-pocket expenses, such as legal costs, in
performing these services. These expenses are recovered through the revenue the Corporation earns
from the customer and are included in operating expenses. Syndication fees represent fees earned as
the agent or lead lender responsible for structuring, arranging and administering a loan syndication.
Financial advisory services consist of fees earned for assisting clients with transactions related to
mergers and acquisitions and financial restructurings. Revenue varies depending on the size of the
transaction and scope of services performed and is generally contingent on successful completion of
the transaction. Revenue is typically recognized once the transaction is completed and all services
have been rendered. Additionally, the Corporation may earn a fixed fee in merger and acquisition
transactions to provide a fairness opinion, with the fees recognized when the opinion is delivered to
the client. Other Revenue Measurement and Recognition Policies The Corporation did not disclose the
value of any open performance obligations at December 31, 2020, as its contracts with customers
generally have a fixed term that is less than one year, an open term with a cancellation period that
is less than one year, or provisions that allow the Corporation to recognize revenue at the amount it
has the right to invoice. Earnings Per Common Share Earnings per common share (EPS) is computed by
dividing net income allocated to common shareholders by the weighted-average common shares
outstanding, excluding unvested common shares subject to repurchase or cancellation. Net income
allocated to common shareholders is net income adjusted for preferred stock dividends including
dividends declared, accretion of discounts on preferred stock including accelerated accretion when
preferred stock is repaid early, and cumulative dividends related to the current dividend period that
have not been declared as of period end, less income allocated to participating securities. Diluted
EPS is computed by dividing income allocated to common shareholders plus dividends on dilutive
convertible preferred stock and preferred stock that can be tendered to exercise warrants, by the
weighted-average common shares outstanding plus amounts representing the dilutive effect of stock
options outstanding, restricted stock, restricted stock units (RSUs), outstanding warrants and the
dilution resulting from the conversion of convertible preferred stock, if applicable. Foreign
Currency Translation Assets, liabilities and operations of foreign branches and subsidiaries are
recorded based on the functional currency of each entity. When the functional currency of a foreign
operation is the local currency, the assets, liabilities and operations are translated, for
consolidation purposes, from the local currency to the U.S. dollar reporting currency at period-end
rates for assets and liabilities and generally at average rates for results of operations. The
resulting unrealized gains and losses are reported as a component of accumulated OCI, net-of-tax.
When the foreign entity’s functional currency is the U.S. dollar, the resulting remeasurement gains
or losses on foreign currency-denominated assets or liabilities are included in earnings. Paycheck
Protection Program The Corporation is participating in the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), which
is a loan program that originated from the CARES Act and was subsequently expanded by the Paycheck
Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act. The PPP is designed to provide U.S. small
businesses with cash-flow assistance through loans fully guaranteed by the Small
 109Bank of America 
Business Administration (SBA). If the borrower
meets certain criteria and uses the proceeds
towards certain eligible expenses, the borrower’s
obligation to repay the loan can be forgiven up
to the full principal amount of the loan and any
accrued interest. Upon borrower forgiveness, the
SBA pays the Corporation for the principal and
accrued interest owed on the loan. If the full
principal of the loan is not forgiven, the loan
will operate according to the original loan terms
with the 100 percent SBA guaranty remaining. As
of December 31, 2020, the
Corporation had approximately 332,000PPP loans
with a carrying value of $ 22.7billion. As
compensation for originating the loans, the
Corporation received lender processing fees from
the SBA, which are capitalized, along with the
loan origination costs, and will be amortized
over the loans’ contractual lives and recognized
as interest income. Upon forgiveness of a loan
and repayment by the SBA, any unrecognized net
capitalized fees and costs related to the loan
will be recognized as interest income in that
period.

NOTE 3 Derivatives
Derivative Balances Derivatives are entered into
on behalf of customers, for trading or to support
risk management activities. Derivatives used in
risk management activities include derivatives
that may or may not be designated in qualifying
hedge accounting relationships. Derivatives that
are not designated in qualifying hedge accounting
relationships are referred to as other risk
management derivatives. For more information on
the
Corporation’s derivatives and hedging activities,
see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting
Principles. The following tables present
derivative instruments included on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet in derivative assets
and liabilities at December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Balances are presented on a gross basis, prior to
the application of counterparty and cash
collateral netting. Total derivative assets and
liabilities are adjusted on an aggregate basis to
take into consideration the effects of legally
enforceable master netting agreements and have
been reduced by cash collateral received or paid.

Offsetting of Derivatives The Corporation enters into International Swaps and Derivatives
Association, Inc. (ISDA) master netting agreements or similar agreements with substantially all of
the Corporation’s derivative counterparties. Where legally enforceable, these master netting
agreements give the Corporation, in the event of default by the counterparty, the right to liquidate
securities held as collateral and to offset receivables and payables with the same counterparty. For
purposes of the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Corporation offsets derivative assets and liabilities
and cash collateral held with the same counterparty where it has such a legally enforceable master
netting agreement. The following table presents derivative instruments included in derivative assets
and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2020 and 2019 by primary risk
(e.g., interest rate risk) and the platform, where applicable, on which these derivatives are
transacted. Balances are presented on a gross basis, prior to the application of counterparty and
cash collateral netting. Total gross derivative assets and liabilities are adjusted on an aggregate
basis to take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements which
include reducing the balance for counterparty netting and cash collateral received or paid. For more
information on offsetting of securities financing agreements, see Note 10 – Federal Funds Sold or
Purchased, Securities Financing Agreements, Short-term Borrowings and Restricted Cash .

(1) OTC derivatives include bilateral transactions between the Corporation and a particular
counterparty. OTC-cleared derivatives include bilateral transactions between the Corporation and a
counterparty where the transaction is cleared through a clearinghouse. Exchange-traded derivatives
include listed options transacted on an exchange.
(2) Consists of derivatives entered into under master netting agreements where the enforceability of
these agreements is uncertain under bankruptcy laws in some countries or industries.
(3) Amounts are limited to the derivative asset/liability balance and, accordingly, do not include
excess collateral received/pledged. Financial instruments collateral includes securities collateral
received or pledged and cash securities held and posted at third-party custodians that are not offset
on the Consolidated Balance Sheet but shown as a reduction to derive net derivative assets and
liabilities.
ALM and Risk Management Derivatives The Corporation’s ALM and risk management activities include the
use of derivatives to mitigate risk to the Corporation including derivatives designated in qualifying
hedge accounting relationships and derivatives used in other risk management activities. Interest
rate, foreign exchange, equity, commodity and credit contracts are utilized in the Corporation's ALM
and risk management activities. The Corporation maintains an overall interest rate risk management
strategy that incorporates the use of interest rate contracts, which are generally non-leveraged
generic interest rate and basis swaps, options, futures and forwards, to minimize significant
fluctuations in earnings caused by interest rate volatility. The Corporation’s goal is to manage
interest rate sensitivity and volatility so that movements in interest rates do not significantly
adversely affect earnings or capital. As a result of interest rate fluctuations, hedged fixed-rate
assets and liabilities appreciate or depreciate in fair value. Gains or losses on the derivative
instruments that are linked to the hedged fixed-rate assets and liabilities are expected to
substantially offset this unrealized appreciation or depreciation. Market risk, including interest
rate risk, can be substantial in the mortgage business. Market risk in the mortgage business is the
risk that values of mortgage assets or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market
conditions such as interest rate movements. To mitigate the interest rate risk in mortgage banking
production income, the Corporation utilizes forward loan sale commitments and other derivative
instruments, including purchased options, and certain debt securities. The Corporation also utilizes
derivatives such as interest rate options, interest rate swaps, forward settlement contracts and
eurodollar futures to hedge certain market risks of MSRs. The Corporation uses foreign exchange
contracts to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with certain foreign currency-denominated
assets and liabilities, as well as the Corporation’s investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries. Exposure
to loss on these contracts will increase or decrease over their respective lives as currency exchange
and interest rates fluctuate. The Corporation purchases credit derivatives to manage credit risk
related to certain funded and unfunded credit exposures. Credit derivatives include credit default
swaps (CDS), total return swaps and swaptions. These derivatives are recorded on the Consolidated
Balance Sheet at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in other income. Derivatives
Designated as Accounting Hedges The Corporation uses various types of interest rate and foreign
exchange derivative contracts to protect against changes in the fair value of its assets and
liabilities due to fluctuations in interest rates and exchange rates (fair value hedges). The
Corporation also uses these types of contracts to protect against changes in the cash flows of its
assets and liabilities,
 113Bank of America 
and other forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges). The Corporation hedges its net investment in
consolidated non-U.S. operations determined to have functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar
using forward exchange contracts and cross-currency basis swaps, and by issuing foreign currency-
denominated debt (net investment hedges).

(2) At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the cumulative fair value adjustments remaining on long-term debt
and AFS debt securities from discontinued hedging relationships resulted in an (increase) decrease in
the related liability of $( 3.7) billion and $ 1.3billion and an increase (decrease) in the related
asset of $( 69) million and $ 8million, which are being amortized over the remaining contractual life
of the de-designated hedged items.
(3) These amounts include the amortized cost basis of the prepayable financial assets used to
designate hedging relationships in which the hedged item is the last layer expected to be remaining
at the end of the hedging relationship (i.e. last-of-layer hedging relationship). At December 31,
2020, the amortized cost of the closed portfolios used in these hedging relationships was $
34.6billion, of which $ 7.0billion was designated in the last-of-layer hedging relationship. The
cumulative basis adjustments associated with these hedging relationships were not significant.
(4) Carrying value represents amortized cost.
(5) Represents hedging activities related to precious metals inventory.
Cash Flow and Net Investment Hedges The following table summarizes certain information related to
cash flow hedges and net investment hedges for 2020, 2019 and 2018. Of the $ 426million after-tax net
gain ($ 566million pretax) on derivatives in accumulated OCI at December 31, 2020, gains of $
190million after-tax ($ 254million pretax) related to both open and terminated hedges are expected to
be reclassified into earnings in the next 12 months. These net gains reclassified into earnings are
expected to primarily increase net interest income related to the respective hedged items. For
terminated cash flow hedges, the time period over which the majority of the forecasted transactions
are hedged is approximately 3years, with a maximum length of time for certain forecasted transactions
of 16years.

Transfers of Financial Assets with Risk Retained
through Derivatives The Corporation enters into
certain transactions involving the transfer of
financial assets that are accounted for as sales
where substantially all of the economic exposure
to the transferred financial assets is retained
through derivatives (e.g., interest rate and/or
credit), but the Corporation does not retain
control over the assets transferred. At both
December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Corporation had
transferred $ 5.2billion of non-U.S. government-
guaranteed mortgage-backed securities to a third-
party trust and retained economic exposure to the
transferred assets through derivative contracts.
In connection with these transfers, the
Corporation received gross cash proceeds of $
5.2billion as of both transfer dates. At December
31, 2020 and 2019, the fair value of the
transferred securities was $ 5.5billion and $
5.3billion. Sales and Trading Revenue The
Corporation enters into trading derivatives to
facilitate client transactions and to manage risk
exposures arising from trading account assets and
liabilities. It is the Corporation’s policy to
include these derivative instruments in its
trading activities, which include derivatives and
non-derivative cash instruments. The resulting
risk from these derivatives is managed on a
portfolio basis as part of the Corporation’s
Global Markets business segment. The related
sales and trading revenue generated within Global
Markets is recorded in various income statement
line items, including market making and similar
activities and net interest income as well as
other revenue categories. Sales and trading
revenue includes changes in the fair value and
realized gains and losses on the sales of trading
and other assets, net interest income, and fees
primarily from commissions on equity securities.
Revenue is generated by the difference in the
client price for an instrument and the price at
which the trading desk can execute the trade in
the dealer market. For equity securities,
commissions related to purchases and sales are
recorded in the “Other” column in the Sales and
Trading Revenue table. Changes in the fair value
of these securities are included in market making
and similar activities. For debt securities,
revenue, with the exception of interest
associated with the debt securities, is typically
included in
market making and similar activities. Unlike
commissions for equity securities, the initial
revenue related to broker-dealer services for
debt securities is typically included in the
pricing of the instrument rather than being
charged through separate fee arrangements.
Therefore, this revenue is recorded in market
making and similar activities as part of the
initial mark to fair value. For derivatives, the
majority of revenue is included in market making
and similar activities. In transactions where the
Corporation acts as agent, which include
exchange-traded futures and options, fees are
recorded in other income. The following table,
which includes both derivatives and non-
derivative cash instruments, identifies the
amounts in the respective income statement line
items attributable to the Corporation’s sales and
trading revenue in Global Markets , categorized
by primary risk, for 2020, 2019 and 2018. This
table includes debit valuation adjustment (DVA)
and funding valuation adjustment (FVA) gains
(losses). Global Markets results in Note 23 –

Credit Derivatives The Corporation enters into
credit derivatives primarily to facilitate client
transactions and to manage credit risk exposures.
Credit derivatives derive value based on an
underlying third-party referenced obligation or a
portfolio of referenced obligations and generally
require the Corporation, as the seller of credit
protection, to make payments to a buyer upon the
occurrence of a predefined credit event. Such
credit events generally include bankruptcy of the
referenced credit entity and failure to pay under
the obligation, as well as acceleration of
indebtedness and payment repudiation or
 115Bank of America 
moratorium. For credit derivatives based on a portfolio of referenced credits or credit indices, the
Corporation may not be required to make payment until a specified amount of loss has occurred and/or
may only be required to make payment up to a specified amount. Credit derivatives are classified as
investment and non-investment grade based on the credit quality of the underlying referenced
obligation. The Corporation considers ratings of BBB- or higher as investment grade. Non-investment
grade includes non-rated credit derivative instruments. The Corporation discloses internal
categorizations of investment grade and non-investment grade consistent with how risk is managed for
these instruments. Credit derivative instruments where the Corporation is the seller of credit
protection and their expiration at December 31, 2020 and 2019 are summarized in the following table.

 derivatives 
The notional amount represents the maximum amount payable by the Corporation for most credit
derivatives. However, the Corporation does not monitor its exposure to credit derivatives based
solely on the notional amount because this measure does not take into consideration the probability
of occurrence. As such, the notional amount is not a reliable indicator of the Corporation’s exposure
to these contracts. Instead, a risk framework is used to define risk tolerances and establish limits
so that certain credit risk-related losses occur within acceptable, predefined limits. Credit-related
notes in the table above include investments in securities issued by CDO, collateralized loan
obligation (CLO) and credit-linked note vehicles. These instruments are primarily classified as
trading securities. The carrying value of these instruments equals the Corporation’s maximum exposure
to loss. The Corporation is not obligated to make any payments to the entities under the terms of the
securities owned.
 Bank of America116 
Credit-related Contingent Features and Collateral
The Corporation executes the majority of its
derivative contracts in the OTC market with
large, international financial institutions,
including broker-dealers and, to a lesser degree,
with a variety of non-financial companies. A
significant majority of the derivative
transactions are executed on a daily margin
basis. Therefore, events such as a credit rating
downgrade (depending on the ultimate rating
level) or a breach of credit covenants would
typically require an increase in the amount of
collateral required of the counterparty, where
applicable, and/or allow the Corporation to take
additional protective measures such as early
termination of all trades. Further, as previously
discussed on page 112, the Corporation enters
into legally enforceable master netting
agreements that reduce risk by permitting
closeout and netting of transactions with the
same counterparty upon the occurrence of certain
events. Certain of the Corporation’s derivative
contracts contain credit risk-related contingent
features, primarily in the form of ISDA master
netting agreements and credit support
documentation that enhance the creditworthiness
of these instruments compared to other
obligations of the respective counterparty with
whom the Corporation has transacted. These
contingent features may be for the benefit of the
Corporation as well as its counterparties with
respect to changes in the Corporation’s
creditworthiness and the mark-to-market exposure
under the derivative transactions. At December
31, 2020 and 2019, the Corporation held cash and
securities collateral of $ 96.5billion and $
84.3billion and posted cash and securities
collateral of $ 88.6billion and $ 69.1billion in
the normal course of business under derivative
agreements, excluding cross-product margining
agreements where clients are permitted to margin
on a net basis for both derivative and secured
financing arrangements. In connection with
certain OTC derivative contracts and other
trading agreements, the Corporation can be
required to provide additional collateral or to
terminate transactions with certain
counterparties in the event of a downgrade of the
senior debt ratings of the Corporation or certain
subsidiaries. The amount of additional collateral
required depends on the contract and is usually a
fixed incremental amount and/or the market value
of the exposure. At December 31, 2020, the amount
of collateral, calculated based on the terms of
the contracts, that the Corporation and certain
subsidiaries could be required to post to
counterparties but had not yet posted to
counterparties was $ 2.6billion, including $
1.2billion for Bank of America, National
Association (BANA). Some counterparties are
currently able to unilaterally terminate certain
contracts, or the Corporation or certain
subsidiaries may be required to take other action
such as find a suitable replacement or obtain a
guarantee. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the
liability recorded for these derivative contracts
was not significant. The following table presents
the amount of additional collateral that would
have been contractually required by derivative
contracts and other trading agreements at
December 31, 2020 if the rating agencies had
downgraded their long-term senior debt ratings
for the Corporation or certain subsidiaries by
one incremental notch and by an additional second
incremental notch.

Valuation Adjustments on Derivatives The
Corporation records credit risk valuation
adjustments on derivatives in order to properly
reflect the credit quality of the counterparties
and its own credit quality. The Corporation
calculates valuation adjustments on derivatives
based on a modeled expected exposure that
incorporates current market risk factors. The
exposure also takes into consideration credit
mitigants such as enforceable master netting
agreements and collateral. CDS spread data is
used to estimate the default probabilities and
severities that are applied to the exposures.
Where no observable credit default data is
available for counterparties, the Corporation
uses proxies and other market data to estimate
default probabilities and severity.
The table below presents credit valuation adjustment (CVA), DVA and FVA gains (losses) on derivatives
(excluding the effect of any related hedge activities), which are recorded in market making and
similar activities, for 2020, 2019 and 2018. CVA gains reduce the cumulative CVA thereby increasing
the derivative assets balance. DVA gains increase the cumulative DVA thereby decreasing the
derivative liabilities balance. CVA and DVA losses have the opposite impact. FVA gains related to
derivative assets reduce the cumulative FVA thereby increasing the derivative assets balance. FVA
gains related to derivative liabilities increase the cumulative FVA thereby decreasing the derivative
liabilities balance. FVA losses have the opposite impact.

177million, $ 153million and $ 151million, and cumulative DVA reduced the derivative liabilities
balance by $ 309million, $ 285million and $ 432million, respectively.

At December 31, 2020, the accumulated net unrealized gain on AFS debt securities, excluding the
amount related to debt securities previously transferred to held to maturity, included in accumulated
OCI was $ 4.7billion, net of the related income tax expense of $ 1.6billion. The Corporation had
nonperforming AFS debt securities of $ 20million and $ 9million at December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Effective January 1, 2020, the Corporation adopted the new accounting standard for credit losses that
requires evaluation of AFS and HTM debt securities for any expected losses with recognition of an
allowance for credit losses, when applicable. For more information, see Note 1 – Summary of
Significant Accounting Principles . At December 31, 2020, the Corporation had $ 200.0billion in AFS
debt securities, which were primarily U.S. agency and U.S. Treasury securities that have a zero
credit loss assumption. For the remaining $ 34.5billion in AFS debt securities, the amount of ECL was
insignificant. Substantially all of the Corporation's HTM debt securities are U.S. agency and U.S.
Treasury securities and have a zero credit loss assumption. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the
Corporation held equity securities at an aggregate fair value of $ 769million and $ 891million and
other equity securities, as valued under the measurement alternative, at a carrying value of $
240million and $ 183million, both of which are included in other assets. At December 31, 2020 and
2019, the Corporation also held money market investments at a fair value of $ 1.6billion and $
1.0billion, which are included in time deposits placed and other short-term investments.

contractual life of each security. The average yield considers the contractual coupon and the
amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, excluding the effect of related hedging
derivatives.

(1) Consumer real estate loans 30-59 days past due includes fully-insured loans of $ 517million and
nonperforming loans of $ 139million. Consumer real estate loans 60-89 days past due includes fully-
insured loans of $ 206million and nonperforming loans of $ 114million. Consumer real estate loans 90
days or more past due includes fully-insured loans of $ 1.1billion. Consumer real estate loans
current or less than 30 days past due includes $ 856million and direct/indirect consumer includes $
45million of nonperforming loans.
(2) Total outstandings primarily includes auto and specialty lending loans and leases of $
50.4billion, U.S. securities-based lending loans of $ 36.7billion and non-U.S. consumer loans of $
2.8billion.
(3) Consumer loans accounted for under the fair value option includes residential mortgage loans of $
257million and home equity loans of $ 337million. Commercial loans accounted for under the fair value
option includes U.S. commercial loans of $ 4.7billion and non-U.S. commercial loans of $ 3.1billion.
For more information, see Note 20 – Fair Value Measurements and Note 21 – Fair Value Option .
(4) Total outstandings includes U.S. commercial real estate loans of $ 59.0billion and non-U.S.
commercial real estate loans of $ 3.7billion.
(5) Total outstandings includes loans and leases pledged as collateral of $ 25.9billion. The
Corporation also pledged $ 168.2billion of loans with no related outstanding borrowings to secure
potential borrowing capacity with the Federal Reserve Bank and Federal Home Loan Bank.
The Corporation categorizes consumer real estate loans as core and non-core based on loan and
customer characteristics such as origination date, product type, LTV, Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO)
score and delinquency status consistent with its current consumer and mortgage servicing strategy.
Generally, loans that were originated after January 1, 2010, qualified under government-sponsored
enterprise (GSE) underwriting guidelines, or otherwise met the Corporation’s underwriting guidelines
in place in 2015 are characterized as core loans. All other loans are generally characterized as non-
core loans and represent runoff portfolios. The Corporation has entered into long-term credit
protection agreements with FNMA and FHLMC on loans totaling $ 9.0billion and $ 7.5billion at December
31, 2020 and 2019, providing full credit protection on residential mortgage loans that become
severely delinquent. All of these loans are individually insured, and therefore the Corporation does
not record an allowance for credit losses related to these loans. Nonperforming Loans and Leases
Commercial nonperforming loans increased to $ 2.2billion at December 31, 2020 from $ 1.5billion at
December 31, 2019 with broad-based increases across multiple industries. Consumer nonperforming loans
increased to $ 2.7billion at December 31, 2020 from $ 2.1billion at December 31, 2019 driven by
deferral activity, as well as the inclusion of $ 144million of certain loans that were previously
classified as purchased credit-impaired loans and accounted for under a pool basis. The table below
presents the Corporation’s nonperforming loans and leases including nonperforming TDRs, and loans
accruing past due 90days or more at December 31, 2020 and 2019. Nonperforming LHFS are excluded from
nonperforming loans and leases as they are recorded at either fair value or the lower of cost or fair
value. For information on the Corporation's interest accrual policies, delinquency status for loan
modifications related to the pandemic and the criteria for classification as nonperforming, see Note
1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles.

(2) Residential mortgage loans accruing past due
90 days or more are fully-insured loans. At
December 31, 2020 and 2019 residential mortgage
includes $ 537million and $ 740million of loans
on which interest had been curtailed by the FHA,
and therefore were no longer accruing interest,
although principal was still insured, and $
225million and $ 348million of loans on which
interest was still accruing.
(3) Primarily relates to loans for which the
estimated fair value of the underlying collateral
less any costs to sell is greater than the
amortized cost of the loans as of the reporting
date.
n/a = not applicable
Included in the December 31, 2020 nonperforming
loans are $ 127million and $ 17million of
residential mortgage and home equity loans that
prior to the January 1, 2020 adoption of the new
credit loss standard were not included in
nonperforming loans, as they were previously
classified as purchased credit-impaired loans and
accounted for under a pool basis.
Credit Quality Indicators The Corporation
monitors credit quality within its Consumer Real
Estate, Credit Card and Other Consumer, and
Commercial portfolio segments based on primary
credit quality indicators. For more information
on the portfolio segments, see Note 1 – Summary
of Significant Accounting Principles . Within the
Consumer Real Estate portfolio segment, the
primary credit quality indicators are refreshed
LTV and refreshed FICO score. Refreshed LTV
measures the carrying value of the loan as a
percentage of the value of the property securing
the loan, refreshed quarterly. Home equity loans
are evaluated using CLTV, which measures the
carrying value of the Corporation’s loan and
available line of credit combined with any
outstanding senior liens against the property as
a percentage of the value of the property
securing the loan, refreshed quarterly. FICO
score measures the creditworthiness of the
borrower based on the financial obligations of
the borrower and the borrower’s credit history.
FICO scores are typically refreshed quarterly or
more
frequently. Certain borrowers (e.g., borrowers
that have had debts discharged in a bankruptcy
proceeding) may not have their FICO scores
updated. FICO scores are also a primary credit
quality indicator for the Credit Card and Other
Consumer portfolio segment and the business card
portfolio within U.S. small business commercial.
Within the Commercial portfolio segment, loans
are evaluated using the internal classifications
of pass rated or reservable criticized as the
primary credit quality indicators. The term
reservable criticized refers to those commercial
loans that are internally classified or listed by
the Corporation as Special Mention, Substandard
or Doubtful, which are asset quality categories
defined by regulatory authorities. These assets
have an elevated level of risk and may have a
high probability of default or total loss. Pass
rated refers to all loans not considered
reservable criticized. In addition to these
primary credit quality indicators, the
Corporation uses other credit quality indicators
for certain types of loans. The following tables
present certain credit quality indicators for the
Corporation's Consumer Real Estate, Credit Card
and Other Consumer, and Commercial portfolio
segments by class of financing receivables and
year of origination for term loan balances at
December 31, 2020, including revolving loans that
converted to term loans without an additional
credit decision after origination or through a
TDR.

Troubled Debt Restructurings The Corporation has
been entering into loan modifications with
borrowers in response to the pandemic, most of
which are not classified as TDRs, and therefore
are not included in the discussion below. For
more information on the criteria for classifying
loans as TDRs, see Note 1 – Summary of
Significant Accounting Principles . Consumer Real
Estate Modifications of consumer real estate
loans are classified as TDRs when the borrower is
experiencing financial difficulties and a
concession has been granted. Concessions may
include reductions in interest rates,
capitalization of past due amounts, principal
and/or interest forbearance, payment extensions,
principal and/or interest forgiveness, or
combinations thereof. Prior to permanently
modifying a loan, the Corporation may enter into
trial modifications with certain borrowers under
both government and proprietary programs. Trial
modifications generally represent a three- to
four-month period during which the borrower makes
monthly payments under the anticipated
modified payment terms. Upon successful
completion of the trial period, the Corporation
and the borrower enter into a permanent
modification. Binding trial modifications are
classified as TDRs when the trial offer is made
and continue to be classified as TDRs regardless
of whether the borrower enters into a permanent
modification. Consumer real estate loans of $
372million that have been discharged in Chapter 7
bankruptcy with no change in repayment terms and
not reaffirmed by the borrower were included in
TDRs at December 31, 2020, of which $ 102million
were classified as nonperforming and $ 68million
were loans fully insured. Consumer real estate
TDRs are measured primarily based on the net
present value of the estimated cash flows
discounted at the loan’s original effective
interest rate. If the carrying value of a TDR
exceeds this amount, a specific allowance is
recorded as a component of the allowance for loan
and lease losses. Alternatively, consumer real
estate TDRs that are considered to be dependent
solely on the collateral for repayment (e.g., due
to the lack of income verification) are measured
based on the estimated fair value of the
collateral, and a charge-off is recorded if the
carrying value exceeds the fair value of the
collateral. Consumer real estate loans that reach
180 days past due prior to modification are
charged off to their net realizable value, less
costs to sell, before they are modified as TDRs
in accordance with established policy. Subsequent
declines in the fair value of the collateral
after a loan has reached 180 days past due are
recorded as charge-offs. Fully-insured loans are
 125Bank of America 
protected against principal loss, and therefore, the Corporation does not record an allowance for
loan and lease losses on the outstanding principal balance, even after they have been modified in a
TDR. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, remaining commitments to lend additional funds to debtors whose
terms have been modified in a consumer real estate TDR were not significant. Consumer real estate
foreclosed properties totaled $ 123million and $ 229million at December 31, 2020 and 2019. The
carrying value of consumer real estate loans, including fully-insured loans, for which formal
foreclosure proceedings were in process at December 31, 2020 was $ 1.2billion. Although the
Corporation has paused formal loan foreclosure proceedings and foreclosure sales for occupied
properties, during 2020, the Corporation reclassified $ 182million of consumer real estate loans
completed or which were in process prior to the pause in foreclosures, to foreclosed properties or,
for properties acquired upon foreclosure of certain government-guaranteed loans (principally FHA-
insured loans), to other assets. The reclassifications represent non-cash investing activities and,
accordingly, are not reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The table below presents
the December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 unpaid principal balance, carrying value, and average pre- and
post-modification interest rates of consumer real estate loans that were modified in TDRs during
2020, 2019 and 2018. The following Consumer Real Estate portfolio segment tables include loans that

Credit Card and Other Consumer The Corporation seeks to assist customers that are experiencing
financial difficulty by modifying loans while ensuring compliance with federal and local laws and
guidelines. Credit card and other consumer loan modifications generally involve reducing the interest
rate on the account, placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months and
canceling the customer’s available line of credit, all of which are considered TDRs. The Corporation
makes loan modifications directly with borrowers for debt held only by the Corporation (internal
programs). Additionally, the Corporation makes loan modifications for borrowers working with third-
party renegotiation agencies that provide solutions to customers’ entire unsecured debt structures
(external programs). The Corporation classifies other secured consumer loans that have been
discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy as TDRs, which are written down to collateral value and placed on
nonaccrual status no later than the time of discharge. The table below provides information on the
Corporation’s Credit Card and Other Consumer TDR portfolio including the December 31, 2020, 2019 and

Credit card and other consumer loans are deemed
to be in payment default during the quarter in
which a borrower misses the second of
twoconsecutive payments. Payment defaults are one
of the factors considered when projecting future
cash flows in the calculation of the allowance
for loan and lease losses for credit card and
other consumer. Based on historical experience,
the Corporation estimates that 13percent of new
credit card TDRs and 19percent of new
direct/indirect consumer TDRs may be in payment
default within 12months after modification.
Commercial Loans Modifications of loans to
commercial borrowers that are experiencing
financial difficulty are designed to reduce the
Corporation’s loss exposure while providing the
borrower with an opportunity to work through
financial difficulties, often to avoid
foreclosure or bankruptcy. Each modification is
unique and reflects the individual circumstances
of the borrower. Modifications that result in a
TDR may include extensions of
maturity at a concessionary (below market) rate
of interest, payment forbearances or other
actions designed to benefit the borrower while
mitigating the Corporation’s risk exposure.
Reductions in interest rates are rare. Instead,
the interest rates are typically increased,
although the increased rate may not represent a
market rate of interest. Infrequently,
concessions may also include principal
forgiveness in connection with foreclosure, short
sale or other settlement agreements leading to
termination or sale of the loan. At the time of
restructuring, the loans are remeasured to
reflect the impact, if any, on projected cash
flows resulting from the modified terms. If a
portion of the loan is deemed to be
uncollectible, a charge-off may be recorded at
the time of restructuring. Alternatively, a
charge-off may have already been recorded in a
previous period such that no charge-off is
required at the time of modification. For more
information on modifications for the U.S. small
business commercial portfolio, see Credit Card
and Other Consumer in this Note.
 127Bank of America 
At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Corporation
had $ 1.7billion and $ 2.2billion of commercial
TDRs with remaining commitments to lend
additional funds to debtors of $ 402million and $
445million. The balance of commercial TDRs in
payment default was $ 218million and $ 207million
at December 31, 2020 and 2019. Loans Held-for-
sale The Corporation had LHFS of $ 9.2billion at
both December 31, 2020 and 2019. Cash and non-
cash proceeds from sales and paydowns of loans
originally classified as LHFS were $ 20.1billion,
$ 30.6billion and $ 29.2billion for 2020, 2019
and 2018, respectively. Cash used for
originations and purchases of LHFS totaled
approximately $ 19.7billion, $ 28.9billion and $
28.1billion for 2020, 2019 and 2018,
respectively. Accrued Interest Receivable Accrued
interest receivable for loans and leases and
loans held-for-sale at December 31, 2020 and 2019
was $ 2.4billion and $ 2.6billion and is reported
in customer and other receivables on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet. Outstanding credit
card loan balances include unpaid principal,
interest and fees. Credit card loans are not
classified as nonperforming but are charged off
no later than the end of the month in which the
account becomes 180 days past due, within 60 days
after receipt of notification of death or
bankruptcy, or upon confirmation of fraud .
During 2020, the Corporation reversed $
512million of interest and fee income against the
income statement line item in which it was
originally recorded upon charge-off of the
principal balance of the loan . For the
outstanding residential mortgage, home equity,
direct/indirect consumer and commercial loan
balances classified as nonperforming during 2020,
the Corporation reversed $ 44million of interest
and fee income at the time the loans were
classified as nonperforming against the income
statement line item in which it was originally
recorded. For more information on the
Corporation's nonperforming loan policies, see
Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting
Principles .
Allowance for Credit Losses On January 1, 2020,
the Corporation adopted the new accounting
standard that requires the measurement of the
allowance for credit losses to be based on
management’s best estimate of lifetime ECL
inherent in the Corporation’s relevant financial
assets. Upon adoption of the new accounting
standard, the Corporation recorded a $
3.3billion, or 32percent, increase in the
allowance for credit losses on January 1, 2020,
which was comprised of a net increase of $
2.9billion in the allowance for loan and lease
losses and a $ 310million increase in the reserve
for unfunded lending commitments. The net
increase in the allowance for loan and lease
losses was primarily driven by a $ 3.1billion
increase in credit card as the Corporation now
reserves for the life of these receivables. The
increase in the reserve for unfunded lending
commitments included $ 119million in the consumer
portfolio for the undrawn portion of HELOCs and $
191million in the commercial portfolio. For more
information on the Corporation's credit loss
accounting policies including the allowance for
credit losses see Note 1 – Summary of Significant
Accounting Principles . The allowance for credit
losses is estimated using quantitative and
qualitative methods that consider a variety of
factors, such as historical loss experience, the
current credit
quality of the portfolio and an economic outlook
over the life of the loan. Qualitative reserves
cover losses that are expected but, in the
Corporation's assessment, may not be adequately
reflected in the quantitative methods or the
economic assumptions. The Corporation
incorporates forward-looking information through
the use of several macroeconomic scenarios in
determining the weighted economic outlook over
the forecasted life of the assets. These
scenarios include key macroeconomic variables
such as gross domestic product, unemployment
rate, real estate prices and corporate bond
spreads. The scenarios that are chosen each
quarter and the weighting given to each scenario
depend on a variety of factors including recent
economic events, leading economic indicators,
internal and third-party economist views, and
industry trends. As of January 1, 2020, to
determine the allowance for credit losses, the
Corporation used a series of economic outlooks
that resulted in an economic outlook that was
weighted towards the potential of a recession
with some expectation of tail risk similar to the
severely adverse scenario used in stress testing.
Various economic outlooks were also used in the
December 31, 2020 estimate for allowance for
credit losses that included consensus estimates,
multiple downside scenarios which assumed a
significantly longer period until economic
recovery, a tail risk scenario similar to the
severely adverse scenario used in stress testing
and an upside scenario to reflect the potential
for continued improvement in the consensus
outlooks. The weighted economic outlook assumes
that the U.S. unemployment rate at the end of
2021 would be relatively consistent with the
level as of December 2020, slightly above
6.5percent. Additionally, in this economic
outlook, U.S. gross domestic product returns to
pre-pandemic levels in the early part of 2022.
The allowance for credit losses considers the
impact of enacted government stimulus, including
the COVID-19 Emergency Relief Act of 2020, and
continues to factor in the unprecedented nature
of the current health crisis. The Corporation
also factored into its allowance for credit
losses an estimated impact from higher-risk
segments that included leveraged loans and
industries such as travel and entertainment,
which have been adversely impacted by the effects
of COVID-19, as well as the energy sector. The
Corporation also holds additional reserves for
borrowers who requested deferrals that take into
account their credit characteristics and payment
behavior subsequent to deferral. The allowance
for credit losses at December 31, 2020 was $
20.7billion, an increase of $ 7.2billion compared
to January 1, 2020. The increase in the allowance
for credit losses was driven by the deterioration
in the economic outlook resulting from the impact
of COVID-19. The increase in the allowance for
credit losses was comprised of a net increase of
$ 6.4billion in the allowance for loan and lease
losses and a $ 755million increase in the reserve
for unfunded lending commitments. The increase in
the allowance for loan and lease losses was
attributed to $ 418million in the consumer real
estate portfolio, $ 1.8billion in the credit card
and other consumer portfolio, and $ 4.2billion in
the commercial portfolio. Outstanding loans and
leases excluding loans accounted for under the
fair value option decreased $ 53.9billion in
2020, driven by consumer loans, which decreased $
37.1billion primarily due to a decline in credit
card loans from reduced retail spending and
higher payments.

NOTE 6 Securitizations and Other Variable
Interest Entities
The Corporation utilizes VIEs in the ordinary
course of business to support its own and its
customers’ financing and investing needs. The
Corporation routinely securitizes loans and debt
securities using VIEs as a source of funding for
the Corporation and as a means of transferring
the economic risk of the loans or debt securities
to third parties. The assets are transferred into
a trust or other securitization vehicle such that
the assets are legally isolated from the
creditors of the Corporation and are not
available to satisfy its obligations. These
assets can only be used to settle obligations of
the trust or other securitization vehicle. The
Corporation also administers, structures or
invests in other VIEs including CDOs, investment
vehicles and other entities. For more information
on the Corporation’s use of VIEs, see Note 1 –
Summary of Significant Accounting Principles. The
tables in this Note present the assets and
liabilities of consolidated and unconsolidated
VIEs at December 31, 2020 and 2019 in situations
where the Corporation has continuing involvement
with transferred assets or if the Corporation
otherwise has a variable interest in the VIE. The
tables also
present the Corporation’s maximum loss exposure
at December 31, 2020 and 2019 resulting from its
involvement with consolidated VIEs and
unconsolidated VIEs in which the Corporation
holds a variable interest. The Corporation’s
maximum loss exposure is based on the unlikely
event that all of the assets in the VIEs become
worthless and incorporates not only potential
losses associated with assets recorded on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet but also potential
losses associated with off-balance sheet
commitments, such as unfunded liquidity
commitments and other contractual arrangements.
The Corporation’s maximum loss exposure does not
include losses previously recognized through
write-downs of assets. The Corporation invests in
ABS issued by third-party VIEs with which it has
no other form of involvement and enters into
certain commercial lending arrangements that may
also incorporate the use of VIEs, for example to
hold collateral. These securities and loans are
included in Note 4 – Securities or Note 5 –
Outstanding Loans and Leases and Allowance for
Credit Losses. In addition, the Corporation has
used VIEs in connection with its funding
activities.
 129Bank of America 
The Corporation did not provide financial support to consolidated or unconsolidated VIEs during 2020,
2019 and 2018 that it was not previously contractually required to provide, nor does it intend to do
so. The Corporation had liquidity commitments, including written put options and collateral value
guarantees, with certain unconsolidated VIEs of $ 929million and $ 1.1billion at December 31, 2020
and 2019. First-lien Mortgage Securitizations As part of its mortgage banking activities, the
Corporation securitizes a portion of the first-lien residential mortgage loans it originates or
purchases from third parties, generally in the form of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS)
guaranteed by government-sponsored enterprises, FNMA and FHLMC (collectively the GSEs), or the
Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) primarily in the case of FHA- insured and U.S.
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)-guaranteed mortgage loans. Securitization usually occurs in
conjunction with or shortly after origination or purchase, and the Corporation may also securitize
loans held in its residential mortgage portfolio. In addition, the Corporation may, from time to
time, securitize commercial mortgages it originates or purchases from other entities. The Corporation
typically services the loans it securitizes. Further, the Corporation may retain beneficial interests
in the securitization trusts including senior and subordinate securities and equity tranches issued
by the trusts. Except as described in Note 12 – Commitments and Contingencies , the Corporation does
not provide guarantees or recourse to the securitization trusts other than standard representations
and warranties. The table below summarizes select information related to first-lien mortgage
securitizations for 2020, 2019 and 2018.

(1) The Corporation transfers residential mortgage loans to securitizations sponsored primarily by
the GSEs or GNMA in the normal course of business and primarily receives RMBS in exchange.
Substantially all of these securities are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy and
are typically sold shortly after receipt.
(2) A majority of the first-lien residential mortgage loans securitized are initially classified as
LHFS and accounted for under the fair value option. Gains recognized on these LHFS prior to
securitization, which totaled $ 160million, $ 64million and $ 71million net of hedges, during 2020,
2019 and 2018, respectively, are not included in the table above.
(3) The Corporation may have the option to repurchase delinquent loans out of securitization trusts,
which reduces the amount of servicing advances it is required to make. The Corporation may also
repurchase loans from securitization trusts to perform modifications. Repurchased loans include FHA-
insured mortgages collateralizing GNMA securities.
The Corporation recognizes consumer MSRs from the sale or securitization of consumer real estate
loans. The unpaid principal balance of loans serviced for investors, including residential mortgage
and home equity loans, totaled $ 160.4billion and $ 192.1billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Servicing fee and ancillary fee income on serviced loans was $ 474million, $ 585million and $
710million during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Servicing advances on serviced loans, including
loans serviced for others and loans held for investment, were $ 2.2billion and $ 2.4billion at
December 31, 2020 and 2019. For more information on MSRs, see Note 20 – Fair Value Measurements .
During 2020, the Corporation completed the sale of $ 9.3billion of consumer real estate loans through
GNMA loan securitizations. As part of the securitizations, the Corporation retained $ 8.4billion of
MBS, which are classified as debt securities carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Total gains on loan sales of $ 704million were recorded in other income in the Consolidated Statement
of Income. The following table summarizes select information related to first-lien mortgage
securitization trusts in which the Corporation held a variable interest at December 31, 2020 and
2019.

(1) Maximum loss exposure includes obligations under loss-sharing reinsurance and other arrangements
for non-agency residential mortgage and commercial mortgage securitizations, but excludes the reserve
for representations and warranties obligations and corporate guarantees and also excludes servicing
advances and other servicing rights and obligations. For more information, see Note 12 – Commitments
and Contingencies and Note 20 – Fair Value Measurements .
(2) Principal balance outstanding includes loans where the Corporation was the transferor to
securitization VIEs with which it has continuing involvement, which may include servicing the loans.

(1) For unconsolidated home equity loan VIEs, the maximum loss exposure includes outstanding trust
certificates issued by trusts in rapid amortization, net of recorded reserves. For both consolidated
and unconsolidated home equity loan VIEs, the maximum loss exposure excludes the reserve for
representations and warranties obligations and corporate guarantees. For more information, see Note
12 – Commitments and Contingencies .
(2) At December 31, 2020 and 2019, loans and leases in the consolidated credit card trust included $
7.6billion and $ 10.5billion of seller’s interest.
(3) The retained senior securities were valued using quoted market prices or observable market inputs
(Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy).
Home Equity Loans The Corporation retains interests, primarily senior securities, in home equity
securitization trusts to which it transferred home equity loans. In addition, the Corporation may be
obligated to provide subordinate funding to the trusts during a rapid amortization event. This
obligation is included in the maximum loss exposure in the table above. The charges that will
ultimately be recorded as a result of the rapid amortization
 131Bank of America 
events depend on the undrawn portion of the HELOCs, performance of the loans, the amount of
subsequent draws and the timing of related cash flows. Credit Card Securitizations The Corporation
securitizes originated and purchased credit card loans. The Corporation’s continuing involvement with
the securitization trust includes servicing the receivables, retaining an undivided interest
(seller’s interest) in the receivables, and holding certain retained interests including subordinate
interests in accrued interest and fees on the securitized receivables and cash reserve accounts.
During 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Corporation issued new senior debt securities to third-party
investors from the credit card securitization trust of $ 1.0billion, $ 1.3billion and $ 4.0billion,
respectively. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Corporation held subordinate securities issued by
the credit card securitization trust with a notional principal amount of $ 6.8billion and $
7.4billion. These securities serve as a form of credit enhancement to the senior debt securities and
have a stated interest rate of zeropercent. During 2020, 2019 and 2018, the credit card
securitization trust issued $ 161million, $ 202million and $ 650million, respectively, of these
subordinate securities. Resecuritization Trusts The Corporation transfers securities, typically MBS,
into resecuritization VIEs generally at the request of customers seeking securities with specific
characteristics. Generally, there are no significant ongoing activities performed in a
resecuritization trust, and no single investor has the unilateral ability to liquidate the trust. The
Corporation resecuritized $ 39.0billion, $ 24.4billion and $ 22.8billion of securities during 2020,
2019 and 2018, respectively. Securities transferred into resecuritization VIEs were measured at fair
value with changes in fair value recorded in market making and similar activities prior to the
resecuritization and, accordingly, no gain or loss on sale was recorded. Securities received from the
resecuritization VIEs were recognized at their fair value of $ 6.1billion, $ 5.2billion and $
4.1billion during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. In 2019 and 2018, substantially all of the
securities were classified as trading account assets. All of the securities received as
resecuritization proceeds during 2020 were classified as trading account assets. Of the securities
received as resecuritizations proceeds during 2020, $ 2.4billion, $ 2.1billion and $ 1.7billion were
classified as trading account assets, debt securities carried at fair value and HTM securities,
respectively. Substantially all of the trading account securities and debt securities carried at fair
value were categorized as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. Municipal Bond Trusts The
Corporation administers municipal bond trusts that hold highly-rated, long-term, fixed-rate municipal
bonds. The trusts obtain financing by issuing floating-rate trust certificates that reprice on a
weekly or other short-term basis to third-party investors. The Corporation’s liquidity commitments to
unconsolidated municipal bond trusts, including those for which the Corporation was transferor,
totaled $ 3.5billion and $ 3.7billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019. The weighted-average remaining
life of bonds held in the trusts at December 31, 2020 was 6.8years. There were no significant write-
downs or downgrades of assets or issuers during 2020, 2019 and 2018. Other Variable Interest Entities

 VIEs(1) 
(1) Prior-period amounts have been revised to remove certain entities that are no longer considered
VIEs.
Customer VIEs Customer VIEs include credit-linked, equity-linked and commodity-linked note VIEs,
repackaging VIEs and asset acquisition VIEs, which are typically created on behalf of customers who
wish to obtain market or credit exposure to a specific company, index, commodity or financial
instrument. The Corporation’s maximum loss exposure to consolidated and unconsolidated customer VIEs
totaled $ 2.3billion and $ 2.2billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, including the notional amount of
derivatives to which the Corporation is a counterparty, net of losses previously recorded, and the
Corporation’s investment, if any, in securities issued by the VIEs. Collateralized Debt Obligation
VIEs The Corporation receives fees for structuring CDO VIEs, which hold diversified pools of fixed-
income securities, typically corporate debt or ABS, which the CDO VIEs fund by issuing multiple
tranches of debt and equity securities. CDOs are generally managed by third-party portfolio managers.
The Corporation typically transfers assets to these CDOs, holds securities issued by the CDOs and may
be a derivative
 Bank of America132 
counterparty to the CDOs. The Corporation’s
maximum loss exposure to consolidated and
unconsolidated CDOs totaled $ 298million and $
304million at December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Investment VIEs The Corporation sponsors, invests
in or provides financing, which may be in
connection with the sale of assets, to a variety
of investment VIEs that hold loans, real estate,
debt securities or other financial instruments
and are designed to provide the desired
investment profile to investors or the
Corporation. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the
Corporation’s consolidated investment VIEs had
total assets of $ 494million and $ 104million.
The Corporation also held investments in
unconsolidated VIEs with total assets of $
5.4billion and $ 5.1billion at December 31, 2020
and 2019. The Corporation’s maximum loss exposure
associated with both consolidated and
unconsolidated investment VIEs totaled $
1.5billion and $ 1.6billion at December 31, 2020
and 2019 comprised primarily of on-balance sheet
assets less non-recourse liabilities. Leveraged
Lease Trusts The Corporation’s net investment in
consolidated leveraged lease trusts totaled $
1.7billion at both December 31, 2020 and 2019.
The trusts hold long-lived equipment such as rail
cars, power generation and distribution
equipment, and commercial aircraft. The
Corporation structures the trusts and holds a
significant residual interest. The net investment
represents the Corporation’s maximum loss
exposure to the trusts in the unlikely event that
the leveraged lease investments become worthless.
Debt issued by the leveraged lease trusts is non-
recourse to the Corporation. Tax Credit VIEs The
Corporation holds investments in unconsolidated
limited partnerships and similar entities that
construct, own and operate affordable housing,
wind and solar projects. An unrelated third party
is typically the general partner or managing
member and has control over the significant
activities of the VIE. The Corporation earns a
return primarily through the receipt of tax
credits allocated to the projects. The maximum
loss exposure included in the Other VIEs table
was $ 22.0billion and $ 18.9billion at December
31, 2020 and 2019. The Corporation’s risk of loss
is generally mitigated by policies requiring that
the project qualify for the expected tax credits
prior to making its investment. The Corporation’s
investments in affordable housing partnerships,
which are reported in other assets on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet, totaled $ 11.2billion
and $ 10.0billion, including unfunded commitments
to provide capital contributions of $ 5.0billion
and $ 4.3billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019.
The unfunded commitments are expected to be paid
over the next five years. During 2020, 2019 and
2018, the Corporation recognized tax credits and
other tax
benefits from investments in affordable housing
partnerships of $ 1.2billion, $ 1.0billion and $
981million and reported pretax losses in other
income of $ 1.0billion, $ 882million and $
798million, respectively. Tax credits are
recognized as part of the Corporation’s annual
effective tax rate used to determine tax expense
in a given quarter. Accordingly, the portion of a
year’s expected tax benefits recognized in any
given quarter may differ from 25percent. The
Corporation may from time to time be asked to
invest additional amounts to support a troubled
affordable housing project. Such additional
investments have not been and are not expected to
be significant. NOTE 7 Goodwill and Intangible
Assets

applicable reporting units. Based on the results
of the annual goodwill impairment test, the
Corporation determined there was noimpairment.
For more information on the use of quantitative
assessments, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant
Accounting Principles.
Intangible Assets
At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the net carrying
value of intangible assets was $ 2.2billion and $
1.7billion. During 2020, the Corporation
recognized a $ 585million intangible asset, which
is being amortized over a 10-year life, related
to the merchant contracts that were distributed
to the Corporation from its merchant servicing
joint venture. For more information, see Note 12
– Commitments and Contingencies .
At both December 31, 2020 and 2019, intangible
assets included $ 1.6billion of intangible assets
associated with trade names, substantially all of
which had an indefinite life and, accordingly,
are not being amortized. Amortization of
intangibles expense was $ 95million, $ 112million
and $ 538million for 2020, 2019 and 2018.

Lessee Arrangements
The Corporation's lessee arrangements
predominantly consist of operating leases for
premises and equipment; the Corporation's
financing leases are not significant.
Lease terms may contain renewal and extension
options and early termination features.
Generally, these options do not impact the lease
term because the Corporation is not reasonably
certain that it will exercise the options.
The following table provides information on the
right-of-use assets, lease liabilities and
weighted-average discount rates and lease terms
at December 31, 2020 and 2019.

Bank of America, N.A. maintains a global program to offer up to a maximum of $ 75.0billion
outstanding at any one time, of bank notes with fixed or floating rates and maturities of at least
seven daysfrom the date of issue. Short-term bank notes outstanding under this program totaled $
3.9billion and $ 11.7billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019. These short-term bank notes, along with
Federal Home Loan Bank advances, U.S. Treasury tax and loan notes, and term federal funds purchased,
are included in short-term borrowings on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Offsetting of Securities
Financing Agreements The Corporation enters into securities financing agreements to accommodate
customers (also referred to as “matched-book transactions”), obtain securities to cover short
positions and finance inventory positions. Substantially all of the Corporation’s securities
financing activities are transacted under legally enforceable master repurchase agreements or legally
enforceable master securities lending agreements that give the Corporation, in the event of default
by the counterparty, the right to liquidate securities held and to offset receivables and payables
with the same counterparty. The Corporation offsets securities financing transactions with the same
counterparty on the Consolidated Balance Sheet where it has such a legally enforceable master netting
agreement and the transactions have the same maturity date. The Securities Financing Agreements table
presents securities financing agreements included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in federal funds
sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell, and in federal funds purchased
and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase at December 31, 2020 and 2019. Balances
are presented on a gross basis, prior to the application of counterparty netting. Gross assets and
liabilities are adjusted on an aggregate basis to take into consideration the effects of legally
enforceable master netting agreements. For more information on the offsetting of derivatives, see
Note 3 – Derivatives .

Under repurchase agreements, the Corporation is
required to post collateral with a market value
equal to or in excess of the principal amount
borrowed. For securities loaned transactions, the
Corporation receives collateral in the form of
cash, letters of credit or other securities. To
determine whether the market value of the
underlying collateral remains sufficient,
collateral is generally valued daily, and the
Corporation may be required to deposit additional
collateral or may receive or return collateral
pledged when appropriate. Repurchase agreements
and securities loaned transactions are generally
either overnight, continuous (i.e., no stated
term) or short-term. The Corporation manages
liquidity risks related to these agreements by
sourcing
funding from a diverse group of counterparties,
providing a range of securities collateral and
pursuing longer durations, when appropriate.
Restricted Cash At December 31, 2020 and 2019,
the Corporation held restricted cash included
within cash and cash equivalents on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet of $ 7.0billion and $
24.4billion, predominantly related to cash held
on deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank and
non-U.S. central banks to meet reserve
requirements and cash segregated in compliance
with securities regulations.

During 2020, the Corporation issued $ 56.9billion of long-term debt consisting of $ 43.8billion of
notes issued by Bank of America Corporation, $ 4.8billion of notes issued by Bank of America, N.A.
and $ 8.3billion of other debt. During 2019, the Corporation issued $ 52.5billion of long-term debt
consisting of $ 29.3billion of notes issued by Bank of America Corporation, $ 10.9billion of notes
issued by Bank of America, N.A. and $ 12.3billion of other debt. During 2020, the Corporation had
total long-term debt maturities and redemptions in the aggregate of $ 47.1billion consisting of $
22.6billion for Bank of America Corporation, $ 11.5billion for Bank of America, N.A. and $
13.0billion of other debt. During 2019, the Corporation had total long-term debt maturities and
redemptions in the aggregate of $ 50.6billion consisting of $ 21.1billion for Bank of America
Corporation, $ 19.9billion for Bank of America, N.A. and $ 9.6billion of other debt. Bank of America
Corporation and Bank of America, N.A. maintain various U.S. and non-U.S. debt programs to offer both
senior and subordinated notes. The notes may be denominated in U.S. dollars or foreign currencies. At
December 31, 2020 and 2019, the amount of foreign currency-denominated debt translated into U.S.
dollars included in total long-term debt was $ 54.6billion and $ 49.6billion. Foreign currency
contracts may be used to convert certain foreign currency-denominated debt into U.S. dollars. At
December 31, 2020, long-term debt of consolidated VIEs in the table above included debt from credit
card, residential mortgage, home equity and other VIEs of $ 6.3billion, $ 491million, $ 178million
and $ 111million, respectively. Long-term debt of VIEs is collateralized by the assets of the VIEs.
For more information, see Note 6 – Securitizations and Other Variable Interest Entities.
 137Bank of America 
The weighted-average effective interest rates for total long-term debt (excluding senior structured
notes), total fixed-rate debt and total floating-rate debt were 3.02percent, 3.29percent and
0.71percent, respectively, at December 31, 2020, and 3.26percent, 3.55percent and 1.92percent,
respectively, at December 31, 2019. The Corporation’s ALM activities maintain an overall interest
rate risk management strategy that incorporates the use of interest rate contracts to manage
fluctuations in earnings caused by interest rate volatility. The Corporation’s goal is to manage
interest rate sensitivity so that movements in interest rates do not have a significantly adverse
effect on earnings and capital. The weighted-average rates are the contractual interest rates on the
debt and do not reflect the impacts of derivative transactions. Debt outstanding of $ 4.8billion at
December 31, 2020 was issued by BofA Finance LLC, a consolidated finance subsidiary of Bank of
America Corporation, the parent company, and is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the parent
company. The table below shows the carrying value for aggregate annual contractual maturities of
long-term debt as of December 31, 2020. Included in the table are certain structured notes issued by
the Corporation that contain provisions whereby the borrowings are redeemable at the option of the
holder (put options) at specified dates prior to maturity. Other structured notes have coupon or
repayment terms linked to the performance of debt or equity securities, indices, currencies or
commodities, and the maturity may be accelerated based on the value of a referenced index or
security. In both cases, the Corporation or a subsidiary may be required to settle the obligation for
cash or other securities prior to the contractual maturity date. These borrowings are reflected in
the table as maturing at their contractual maturity date.

NOTE 12 Commitments and Contingencies
In the normal course of business, the Corporation
enters into a number of off-balance sheet
commitments. These commitments expose the
Corporation to varying degrees of credit and
market risk and are subject to the same credit
and market risk limitation reviews as those
instruments recorded on the Consolidated Balance
Sheet. Credit Extension Commitments The
Corporation enters into commitments to extend
credit such as loan commitments, SBLCs and
commercial letters of credit to meet the
financing needs of its customers. The following
table includes the notional amount of unfunded
legally binding lending commitments net of
amounts distributed (i.e., syndicated or
participated) to other financial institutions.
The distributed amounts were $ 10.5billion and $
10.6billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019. The
carrying value of these commitments at December
31, 2020 and 2019, excluding commitments
accounted for under the fair value option, was
$ 1.9billion and $ 829million, which primarily
related to the reserve for unfunded lending
commitments. The carrying value of these
commitments is classified in accrued expenses and
other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance
Sheet. Legally binding commitments to extend
credit generally have specified rates and
maturities. Certain of these commitments have
adverse change clauses that help to protect the
Corporation against deterioration in the
borrower’s ability to pay. The table below
includes the notional amount of commitments of $
4.0billion and $ 4.4billion at December 31, 2020
and 2019 that are accounted for under the fair
value option. However, the table excludes
cumulative net fair value of $ 99million and $
90million at December 31, 2020 and 2019 on these
commitments, which is classified in accrued
expenses and other liabilities. For more
information regarding the Corporation’s loan
commitments accounted for under the fair value
option, see Note 21 – Fair Value Option.

(1) At December 31, 2020 and 2019, $ 4.8billion and $ 5.1billion of these loan commitments were held
in the form of a security.
(2) The notional amounts of SBLCs and financial guarantees classified as investment grade and non-
investment grade based on the credit quality of the underlying reference name within the instrument
were $ 25.0billion and $ 10.2billion at December 31, 2020, and $ 27.9billion and $ 8.6billion at
December 31, 2019. Amounts in the table include consumer SBLCs of $ 500million and $ 413million at
December 31, 2020 and 2019.
(3) At December 31, 2020 and 2019, included are letters of credit of $ 1.8billion and $ 1.4billion
related to certain liquidity commitments of VIEs. For more information, see Note 6 – Securitizations
and Other Variable Interest Entities .
(4) Includes business card unused lines of credit.
Other Commitments At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Corporation had commitments to purchase loans
(e.g., residential mortgage and commercial real estate) of $ 93million and $ 86million, which upon
settlement will be included in trading account assets, loans or LHFS, and commitments to purchase
commercial loans of $ 645million and $ 1.1billion, which upon settlement will be included in trading
account assets. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Corporation had commitments to purchase
commodities, primarily liquefied natural gas, of $ 582million and $ 830million, which upon settlement
will be included in trading account assets. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Corporation had
commitments to enter into resale and forward-dated resale and securities borrowing agreements of $
66.5billion and $ 97.2billion, and commitments to enter into forward-dated repurchase and securities
lending agreements of $ 32.1billion and $ 24.9billion. These commitments generally expire within the
next 12 months. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Corporation had a commitment to originate or
purchase up to $ 3.9billion and $ 3.3billion on a rolling 12-month basis, of auto loans and leases
from a strategic partner. This commitment extends through November 2022 and can be terminated with
12months prior notice. Other Guarantees Bank-owned Life Insurance Book Value Protection The
Corporation sells products that offer book value protection to insurance carriers who offer group
life insurance policies to corporations, primarily banks. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the notional
amount of these guarantees totaled $ 7.1billion and $ 7.3billion. At both December 31, 2020 and 2019,
the Corporation’s maximum exposure related to these guarantees totaled $ 1.1billion, with estimated
maturity dates between 2033 and 2039. Indemnifications In the ordinary course of business, the
Corporation enters into various agreements that contain indemnifications, such as tax
indemnifications, whereupon payment may become due if certain external events occur, such as a change
in tax law. The indemnification clauses are often standard contractual terms and were entered into in
the normal course of business based on an assessment that the risk of loss would be remote. These
agreements typically contain an early termination clause that permits the Corporation to exit the
agreement upon these events. The maximum potential future payment under indemnification agreements is
difficult to assess for several reasons, including the occurrence of an external event, the inability
to predict future changes in tax and other laws, the difficulty in determining how such laws would
apply to parties in contracts, the absence of exposure limits contained in standard contract language
and the timing of any early termination clauses. Historically, any payments made under these
guarantees have been de minimis. The Corporation has assessed the probability of making such payments
in the future as remote. Merchant Services Prior to July 1, 2020, a significant portion of the
Corporation's merchant processing activity was performed by a joint venture in which the Corporation
held a 49percent ownership interest. On July 29, 2019, the Corporation gave notice to the joint
venture partner of the termination of the joint venture upon the conclusion of its current term on
June 30, 2020. Effective July 1, 2020, the Corporation received its share of the joint venture's
merchant contracts and began performing merchant processing services for these merchants. While
merchants bear responsibility for any credit or debit card charges properly reversed by the
cardholder, the Corporation, in its role as merchant acquirer, may be held liable for any reversed
charges that cannot be collected from the merchants due to, among other things, merchant fraud or
insolvency.
 139Bank of America 
The Corporation, as a card network member bank, also sponsors other merchant acquirers, principally
its former joint venture partner with respect to merchant contracts distributed to that partner upon
the termination of the joint venture. If charges are properly reversed after a purchase and cannot be
collected from either the merchants or merchant acquirers, the Corporation may be held liable for
these reversed charges. The ability to reverse a charge is primarily governed by the applicable
regulatory and card network rules, which include, but are not limited to, the type of charge, type of
payment used and time limits. For the six-months ended December 31, 2020, the Corporation processed
an aggregate purchase volume of $ 339.2billion. The Corporation’s risk in this area primarily relates
to circumstances where a cardholder has purchased goods or services for future delivery. The
Corporation mitigates this risk by requiring cash deposits, guarantees, letters of credit or other
types of collateral from certain merchants. The Corporation’s reserves for contingent losses and the
losses incurred related to the merchant processing activity were not significant. The Corporation
continues to monitor its exposure in this area due to the potential economic impacts of COVID-19.
Exchange and Clearing House Member Guarantees The Corporation is a member of various securities and
derivative exchanges and clearinghouses, both in the U.S. and other countries. As a member, the
Corporation may be required to pay a pro-rata share of the losses incurred by some of these
organizations as a result of another member default and under other loss scenarios. The Corporation’s
potential obligations may be limited to its membership interests in such exchanges and
clearinghouses, to the amount (or multiple) of the Corporation’s contribution to the guarantee fund
or, in limited instances, to the full pro-rata share of the residual losses after applying the
guarantee fund. The Corporation’s maximum potential exposure under these membership agreements is
difficult to estimate; however, the Corporation has assessed the probability of making any such
payments as remote. Prime Brokerage and Securities Clearing Services In connection with its prime
brokerage and clearing businesses, the Corporation performs securities clearance and settlement
services with other brokerage firms and clearinghouses on behalf of its clients. Under these
arrangements, the Corporation stands ready to meet the obligations of its clients with respect to
securities transactions. The Corporation’s obligations in this respect are secured by the assets in
the clients’ accounts and the accounts of their customers as well as by any proceeds received from
the transactions cleared and settled by the Corporation on behalf of clients or their customers. The
Corporation’s maximum potential exposure under these arrangements is difficult to estimate; however,
the potential for the Corporation to incur material losses pursuant to these arrangements is remote.
Fixed Income Clearing Corporation Sponsored Member Repo Program The Corporation acts as a sponsoring
member in a repo program whereby the Corporation clears certain eligible resale and repurchase
agreements through the Government Securities Division of the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation on
behalf of clients that are sponsored members in accordance with the Fixed Income Clearing
Corporation’s rules. As part of this program, the Corporation guarantees the payment and performance
of its sponsored members to the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation. The Corporation’s guarantee
obligation is secured by a security interest in cash or high-quality securities collateral placed by
clients with the clearinghouse and therefore, the potential for the Corporation to incur significant
losses under this arrangement is remote. The Corporation’s maximum potential exposure, without taking
into consideration the related collateral, was $ 22.5billion and $ 9.3billion at December 31, 2020
and 2019. Other Guarantees The Corporation has entered into additional guarantee agreements and
commitments, including sold risk participation swaps, liquidity facilities, lease-end obligation
agreements, partial credit guarantees on certain leases, real estate joint venture guarantees,
divested business commitments and sold put options that require gross settlement. The maximum
potential future payments under these agreements are approximately $ 8.8billion and $ 8.7billion at
December 31, 2020 and 2019. The estimated maturity dates of these obligations extend up to 2049. The
Corporation has made no material payments under these guarantees. For more information on maximum
potential future payments under VIE-related liquidity commitments, see Note 6 – Securitizations and
Other Variable Interest Entities . In the normal course of business, the Corporation periodically
guarantees the obligations of its affiliates in a variety of transactions including ISDA-related
transactions and non-ISDA related transactions such as commodities trading, repurchase agreements,
prime brokerage agreements and other transactions. Guarantees of Certain Long-term Debt The
Corporation, as the parent company, fully and unconditionally guarantees the securities issued by
BofA Finance LLC, a consolidated finance subsidiary of the Corporation, and effectively provides for
the full and unconditional guarantee of trust securities issued by certain statutory trust companies
that are 100percent owned finance subsidiaries of the Corporation. Representations and Warranties
Obligations and Corporate Guarantees The Corporation securitizes first-lien residential mortgage
loans generally in the form of RMBS guaranteed by the GSEs or by GNMA in the case of FHA-insured, VA-
guaranteed and Rural Housing Service-guaranteed mortgage loans, and sells pools of first-lien
residential mortgage loans in the form of whole loans. In addition, in prior years, legacy companies
and certain subsidiaries sold pools of first-lien residential mortgage loans and home equity loans as
private-label securitizations or in the form of whole loans. In connection with these transactions,
the Corporation or certain of its subsidiaries or legacy companies make and have made various
representations and warranties. Breaches of these representations and warranties have resulted in and
may continue to result in the requirement to repurchase mortgage loans or to otherwise make whole or
provide indemnification or other remedies to sponsors, investors, securitization trusts, guarantors,
insurers or other parties (collectively, repurchases). Unresolved Repurchase Claims Unresolved
representations and warranties repurchase claims represent the notional amount of repurchase claims
made by counterparties, typically the outstanding principal balance or the unpaid principal balance
at the time of default. In the case of first-lien mortgages, the claim amount is often significantly
 Bank of America140 
greater than the expected loss amount due to the
benefit of collateral and, in some cases,
mortgage insurance or mortgage guarantee
payments. The notional amount of unresolved
repurchase claims at December 31, 2020 and 2019
was $ 8.5billion and $ 10.7billion. These
balances included $ 2.9billion and $ 3.7billion
at December 31, 2020 and 2019 of claims related
to loans in specific private-label securitization
groups or tranches where the Corporation owns
substantially all of the outstanding securities
or will otherwise realize the benefit of any
repurchase claims paid. During 2020, the
Corporation received $ 89million in new
repurchase claims that were not time-barred.
During 2020, $ 2.4billion in claims were
resolved, including $ 168million of claims that
were deemed time-barred. Reserve and Related
Provision The reserve for representations and
warranties obligations and corporate guarantees
was $ 1.3billion and $ 1.8billion at December 31,
2020 and 2019 and is included in accrued expenses
and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance
Sheet and the related provision is included in
other income in the Consolidated Statement of
Income. The representations and warranties
reserve represents the Corporation’s best
estimate of probable incurred losses, is based on
its experience in previous negotiations, and is
subject to judgment, a variety of assumptions,
and known or unknown uncertainties. Future
representations and warranties losses may occur
in excess of the amounts recorded for these
exposures; however, the Corporation does not
expect such amounts to be material to the
Corporation's financial condition and liquidity.
See Litigation and Regulatory Matters below for
the Corporation's combined range of possible loss
in excess of the reserve for representations and
warranties and the accrued liability for
litigation.
Litigation and Regulatory Matters In the ordinary
course of business, the Corporation and its
subsidiaries are routinely defendants in or
parties to many pending and threatened legal,
regulatory and governmental actions and
proceedings. In view of the inherent difficulty
of predicting the outcome of such matters,
particularly where the claimants seek very large
or indeterminate damages or where the matters
present novel legal theories or involve a large
number of parties, the Corporation generally
cannot predict the eventual outcome of the
pending matters, timing of the ultimate
resolution of these matters, or eventual loss,
fines or penalties related to each pending
matter. As a matter develops, the Corporation, in
conjunction with any outside counsel handling the
matter, evaluates whether such matter presents a
loss contingency that is probable and estimable,
and, for the matters disclosed in this Note,
whether a loss in excess of any accrued liability
is reasonably possible in future periods. Once
the loss contingency is deemed to be both
probable and estimable, the Corporation will
establish an accrued liability and record a
corresponding amount of litigation-related
expense. The Corporation continues to monitor the
matter for further developments that could affect
the amount of the accrued liability that has been
previously established. Excluding expenses of
internal and external legal service providers,
litigation-related expense of $ 823million and $
681million was recognized in 2020 and 2019. For
the matters disclosed in this Note for which a
loss in future periods is reasonably possible and
estimable (whether in excess of an accrued
liability or where there is no accrued liability)
and for representations and warranties exposures,
the Corporation’s estimated range of possible
loss is $ 0to $ 1.3
billion in excess of the accrued liability, if
any, as of December 31, 2020. The accrued
liability and estimated range of possible loss
are based upon currently available information
and subject to significant judgment, a variety of
assumptions and known and unknown uncertainties.
The matters underlying the accrued liability and
estimated range of possible loss are
unpredictable and may change from time to time,
and actual losses may vary significantly from the
current estimate and accrual. The estimated range
of possible loss does not represent the
Corporation’s maximum loss exposure. Information
is provided below regarding the nature of the
litigation and associated claimed damages. Based
on current knowledge, and taking into account
accrued liabilities, management does not believe
that loss contingencies arising from pending
matters, including the matters described herein,
will have a material adverse effect on the
consolidated financial condition or liquidity of
the Corporation. However, in light of the
significant judgment, variety of assumptions and
uncertainties involved in these matters, some of
which are beyond the Corporation’s control, and
the very large or indeterminate damages sought in
some of these matters, an adverse outcome in one
or more of these matters could be material to the
Corporation’s business or results of operations
for any particular reporting period, or cause
significant reputational harm. Ambac Bond
Insurance Litigation Ambac Assurance Corporation
and the Segregated Account of Ambac Assurance
Corporation (together, Ambac) have filed four
separate lawsuits against the Corporation and its
subsidiaries relating to bond insurance policies
Ambac provided on certain securitized pools of
HELOCs, first-lien subprime home equity loans,
fixed-rate second-lien mortgage loans and
negative amortization pay option adjustable-rate
mortgage loans. Ambac alleges that they have paid
or will pay claims as a result of defaults in the
underlying loans and asserts that the defendants
misrepresented the characteristics of the
underlying loans and/or breached certain
contractual representations and warranties
regarding the underwriting and servicing of the
loans. In those actions where the Corporation is
named as a defendant, Ambac contends the
Corporation is liable on various successor and
vicarious liability theories. These actions are
at various procedural stages with material
developments provided below. Ambac v. Countrywide
I The Corporation, and several Countrywide
entities are named as defendants in an action
filed on September 28, 2010 in New York Supreme
Court. Ambac asserts claims for fraudulent
inducement as well as breach of contract and
seeks damages in excess of $ 2.2billion, plus
punitive damages. On May 16, 2017, the First
Department issued its decisions on the parties'
cross-appeals of the trial court's October 22,
2015 summary judgment rulings. Ambac appealed the
First Department's rulings requiring Ambac to
prove all of the elements of its fraudulent
inducement claim, including justifiable reliance
and loss causation; restricting Ambac's sole
remedy for its breach of contract claims to the
repurchase protocol of cure, repurchase or
substitution of any materially defective loan;
and dismissing Ambac's claim for reimbursements
of attorneys' fees. On June 27, 2018, the New
York Court of Appeals affirmed the First
Department rulings that Ambac appealed.
 141Bank of America 
On December 4, 2020, the New York Supreme Court dismissed Ambac’s fraudulent inducement claim. Ambac
appealed the dismissal. Ambac v. Countrywide II On December 30, 2014, Ambac filed a complaint in New
York Supreme Court against the same defendants, claiming fraudulent inducement against Countrywide,
and successor and vicarious liability against the Corporation. Ambac seeks damages in excess of $
600million, plus punitive damages. Ambac v. Countrywide IV On July 21, 2015, Ambac filed an action in
New York Supreme Court against Countrywide asserting the same claims for fraudulent inducement that
Ambac asserted in the now-dismissed Ambac v. Countrywide III. The complaint seeks damages in excess
of $ 350million, plus punitive damages. On December 8, 2020, the New York Supreme Court dismissed
Ambac’s complaint. Ambac appealed the dismissal. Ambac v. First Franklin On April 16, 2012, Ambac
filed an action against BANA, First Franklin and various Merrill Lynch entities, including Merrill
Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, in New York Supreme Court relating to guaranty insurance
Ambac provided on a First Franklin securitization sponsored by Merrill Lynch. The complaint alleges
fraudulent inducement and breach of contract, including breach of contract claims against BANA based
upon its servicing of the loans in the securitization. Ambac seeks as damages hundreds of millions of
dollars that Ambac alleges it has paid or will pay in claims. Deposit Insurance Assessment On January
9, 2017, the FDIC filed suit against BANA in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia
alleging failure to pay a December 15, 2016 invoice for additional deposit insurance assessments and
interest in the amount of $ 542million for the quarters ending June 30, 2013 through December 31,
2014. On April 7, 2017, the FDIC amended its complaint to add a claim for additional deposit
insurance and interest in the amount of $ 583million for the quarters ending March 31, 2012 through
March 31, 2013. The FDIC asserts these claims based on BANA’s alleged underreporting of counterparty
exposures that resulted in underpayment of assessments for those quarters and its Enforcement Section
is also conducting a parallel investigation related to the same alleged reporting error. BANA
disagrees with the FDIC’s interpretation of the regulations as they existed during the relevant time
period and is defending itself against the FDIC’s claims. Pending final resolution, BANA has pledged
security satisfactory to the FDIC related to the disputed additional assessment amounts. On March 27,
2018, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia denied BANA’s partial motion to dismiss
certain of the FDIC’s claims. LIBOR, Other Reference Rates, Foreign Exchange (FX) and Bond Trading
Matters Government authorities in the U.S. and various international jurisdictions continue to
conduct investigations of, to make inquiries of, and to pursue proceedings against, the Corporation
and its subsidiaries regarding FX and other reference rates as well as government, sovereign,
supranational and agency bonds in connection with conduct and systems and controls. The Corporation
is cooperating with these inquiries and investigations, and responding to the proceedings. LIBOR The
Corporation, BANA and certain Merrill Lynch entities have been named as defendants along with most of
the other LIBOR panel banks in a number of individual and putative class actions by persons alleging
they sustained losses on U.S. dollar LIBOR-based financial instruments as a result of collusion or
manipulation by defendants regarding the setting of U.S. dollar LIBOR. Plaintiffs assert a variety of
claims, including antitrust, Commodity Exchange Act, Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations
(RICO), Securities Exchange Act of 1934, common law fraud and breach of contract claims, and seek
compensatory, treble and punitive damages, and injunctive relief. All but one of the cases naming the
Corporation and its affiliates relating to U.S. dollar LIBOR are pending in the U.S. District Court
for the Southern District of New York. The District Court has dismissed all RICO claims, and
dismissed all manipulation claims against Bank of America entities based on alleged trader conduct.
The District Court has also substantially limited the scope of antitrust, Commodity Exchange Act and
various other claims, including by dismissing in their entirety certain individual and putative class
plaintiffs’ antitrust claims for lack of standing and/or personal jurisdiction. Plaintiffs whose
antitrust claims were dismissed by the District Court are pursuing appeals in the Second Circuit.
Certain individual and putative class actions remain pending against the Corporation, BANA and
certain Merrill Lynch entities. On February 28, 2018, the District Court granted certification of a
class of persons that purchased OTC swaps and notes that referenced U.S. dollar LIBOR from one of the
U.S. dollar LIBOR panel banks, limited to claims under Section 1 of the Sherman Act. The U.S. Court
of Appeals for the Second Circuit subsequently denied a petition filed by the defendants for
interlocutory appeal of that ruling. U.S. Bank - Harborview and SURF/OWNIT Repurchase Litigation
Beginning in 2011, U.S. Bank, National Association (U.S. Bank), as trustee for the HarborView
Mortgage Loan Trust 2005-10 and various SURF/OWNIT RMBS trusts filed complaints against the
Corporation, Countrywide entities, Merrill Lynch entities and other affiliates in New York Supreme
Court alleging breaches of representations and warranties. The defendants and certain certificate-
holders in the trusts agreed to settle the respective matters in amounts not material to the
Corporation, subject to acceptance by U.S. Bank. The litigations have been stayed pending
finalization of the settlements.

During 2020, the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve)
announced that due to economic uncertainty
resulting from COVID-19, all large banks would be
required to suspend share repurchase programs in
the third and fourth quarters of 2020, except for
repurchases to offset shares awarded under
equity-based compensation plans, and to limit
dividends to existing rates that do not exceed
the average of the last four quarters’ net
income.
The Federal Reserve’s directives regarding share
repurchases aligned with the Corporation's
decision to voluntarily suspend repurchases
during the first half of 2020. The suspension of
the Corporation's repurchases did not include
repurchases to offset shares awarded under its
equity-based compensation plans.
During 2020, the Corporation repurchased and
retired 227million shares of common stock, which
reduced shareholders’ equity by $ 7.0billion.
During 2020, in connection with employee stock
plans, the Corporation issued 66million shares of
its common stock and, to satisfy tax withholding
obligations, repurchased 26million shares of its
common stock. At December 31, 2020, the
Corporation had reserved 513million unissued
shares of common stock for future issuances under
employee stock plans, convertible notes and
preferred stock.
Preferred Stock
The cash dividends declared on preferred stock
were $ 1.4billion, $ 1.4billion and $ 1.5billion
for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
On January 24, 2020, the Corporation issued
44,000shares of Fixed-to-Floating Rate Non-
Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series MM for $
1.1billion. Dividends are paid semi-annually
during the
fixed-rate period, then quarterly during the floating-rate period. The Series MM preferred stock has
a liquidation preference of $ 25,000per share and is subject to certain restrictions in the event the
Corporation fails to declare and pay full dividends. On October 29, 2020, the Corporation issued
44,000shares of 4.375% Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series NN for $ 1.1billion, with quarterly
dividend payments commencing in February 2021. The Series NN preferred stock has a liquidation
preference of $ 25,000per share and is subject to certain restrictions in the event the Corporation
fails to declare and pay full dividends. On January 28, 2021, the Corporation issued 36,000shares of
4.125% Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series PP for $ 915million, with quarterly dividends
commencing in May 2021. The Series PP preferred stock has a liquidation preference of $ 25,000per
share and is subject to certain restrictions in the event the Corporation fails to declare and pay
full dividends. In 2020, the Corporation fully redeemed Series Y preferred stock for $ 1.1billion.
Additionally, on January 29, 2021, the Corporation fully redeemed Series CC preferred stock for $
1.1billion. All series of preferred stock in the Preferred Stock Summary table have a par value of $
0.01per share, are not subject to the operation of a sinking fund, have no participation rights, and
with the exception of the Series L Preferred Stock, are not convertible. The holders of the Series B
Preferred Stock and Series 1 through 5 Preferred Stock have general voting rights and vote together
with the common stock. The holders of the other series included in the table have no general voting
rights. All outstanding series of preferred stock of the Corporation have preference over the
Corporation’s common stock with respect to the payment of dividends and distribution of the
Corporation’s assets in the event of a liquidation or dissolution. With the exception of the Series
B, F, G and T Preferred Stock, if any dividend payable on these series is in arrears for threeor more
semi-annual or sixor more quarterly dividend periods, as applicable (whether consecutive or not), the
holders of these series and any other class or series of preferred stock ranking equally as to
payment of dividends and upon which equivalent voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable
(voting as a single class) will be entitled to vote for the election of twoadditional directors.
These voting rights terminate when the Corporation has paid in full dividends on these series for at
least twosemi-annual or fourquarterly dividend periods, as applicable, following the dividend
arrearage. The 7.25% Non-Cumulative Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock, Series L (Series L
Preferred Stock) does not have early redemption/call rights. Each share of the Series L Preferred
Stock may be converted at any time, at the option of the holder, into 20shares of the Corporation’s
common stock plus cash in lieu of fractional shares. The Corporation may cause some or all of the
Series L Preferred Stock, at its option, at any time or from time to time, to be converted into
shares of common stock at the then-applicable conversion rate if, for 20trading days during any
period of 30consecutive trading days, the closing price of common stock exceeds 130percent of the
then-applicable conversion price of the Series L Preferred Stock. If a conversion of Series L
Preferred Stock occurs at the option of the holder, subsequent to a dividend record date but prior to
the dividend payment date, the Corporation will still pay any accrued dividends payable.

For 2020, 2019 and 2018, 62million average
dilutive potential common shares associated with
the Series L preferred stock were not included in
the diluted share count because the result would
have been antidilutive under the “if-converted”
method. For 2018, average options to purchase
four millionshares of common stock were
outstanding but not included in the computation
of EPS because the result would have been
antidilutive under the treasury stock method. For
2019 and 2018, average warrants to purchase three
millionand 136million shares of common stock,
respectively, were included in the diluted EPS
calculation under the treasury stock method.
Substantially all of these warrants were
exercised on or before their expiration date of
January 16, 2019.
NOTE 16 Regulatory Requirements and Restrictions
The Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller of
the Currency (OCC) and FDIC (collectively, U.S.
banking regulators) jointly establish regulatory
capital adequacy rules, including Basel 3, for
U.S. banking organizations. As a financial
holding company, the Corporation is subject to
capital adequacy rules issued by
the Federal Reserve. The Corporation’s banking
entity affiliates are subject to capital adequacy
rules issued by the OCC. The Corporation and its
primary banking entity affiliate, BANA, are
Advanced approaches institutions under Basel 3.
As Advanced approaches institutions, the
Corporation and its banking entity affiliates are
required to report regulatory risk-based capital
ratios and risk-weighted assets under both the
Standardized and Advanced approaches. The
approach that yields the lower ratio is used to
assess capital adequacy, including under the
Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework. The
Corporation is required to maintain a minimum
supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) of 3.0 percent
plus a leverage buffer of 2.0 percent in order to
avoid certain restrictions on capital
distributions and discretionary bonus payments.
The Corporation’s insured depository institution
subsidiaries are required to maintain a minimum
6.0 percent SLR to be considered well capitalized
under the PCA framework. The following table
presents capital ratios and related information
in accordance with Basel 3 Standardized and
Advanced approaches as measured at December 31,
2020 and 2019 for the Corporation and BANA.

 ratio 
(1) As of December 31, 2020, capital ratios are calculated using the regulatory capital rule that
allows a five-year transition period related to the adoption of CECL.
(2) Derivative exposure amounts are calculated using the standardized approach for measuring
counterparty credit risk at December 31, 2020 and the current exposure method at December 31, 2019.
(3) The capital conservation buffer and global systemically important bank surcharge were 2.5percent
at both December 31, 2020 and 2019. At December 31, 2020, the Corporation's stress capital buffer of
2.5 percent was applied in place of the capital conservation buffer under the Standardized approach.
The countercyclical capital buffer for both periods was zero. The SLR minimum includes a leverage
buffer of 2.0 percent.
(4) Risk-based capital regulatory minimums at December 31, 2020 and 2019 are the minimum ratios under
Basel 3, including a capital conservation buffer of 2.5 percent. The regulatory minimums for the
leverage ratios as of both period ends are the percent required to be considered well capitalized
under the PCA framework.
(5) Total capital under the Advanced approaches differs from the Standardized approach due to
differences in the amount permitted in Tier 2 capital related to the qualifying allowance for credit
losses.
(6) Reflects total average assets adjusted for certain Tier 1 capital deductions.
(7) Supplementary leverage exposure for the Corporation at December 31, 2020 reflects the temporary
exclusion of U.S. Treasury securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks.
 Bank of America146 
The capital adequacy rules issued by the U.S.
banking regulators require institutions to meet
the established minimums outlined in the table
above. Failure to meet the minimum requirements
can lead to certain mandatory and discretionary
actions by regulators that could have a material
adverse impact on the Corporation’s financial
position. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the
Corporation and its banking entity affiliates
were well capitalized. In response to the
uncertainty arising from the pandemic, the
Federal Reserve required all large banks to
suspend share repurchase programs during the
second half of 2020, except for repurchases to
offset shares awarded under equity-based
compensation plans, and to limit common stock
dividends to existing rates that did not exceed
the average of the last four quarters’ net
income. In December 2020, the Federal Reserve
announced that beginning in the first quarter of
2021, large banks would be permitted to pay
common stock dividends at existing rates and to
repurchase shares in an amount that, when
combined with dividends paid, does not exceed the
average of net income over the last four
quarters. For more information, see Note 13 –
Shareholders’ Equity . Other Regulatory Matters
The Federal Reserve requires the Corporation’s
bank subsidiaries to maintain reserve
requirements based on a percentage of certain
deposit liabilities. The average daily reserve
balance requirements, in excess of vault cash,
maintained by the Corporation with the Federal
Reserve Bank were $ 3.8billion for 2020,
reflecting the Federal Reserve's reduction of the
reserve requirement to zero in the first quarter
due to COVID-19, and $ 14.6billion for 2019. At
December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Corporation had
cash and cash equivalents in the amount of $
4.9billion and $ 6.3billion, and securities with
a fair value of $ 16.8billion and $ 14.7billion
that were segregated in compliance with
securities regulations. Cash held on deposit with
the Federal Reserve Bank to meet reserve
requirements and cash and cash equivalents
segregated in compliance with securities
regulations are components of restricted cash.
For more information, see Note 10 – Federal Funds
Sold or Purchased, Securities Financing
Agreements, Short-term Borrowings and Restricted
Cash . In addition, at December 31, 2020 and
2019, the Corporation had cash deposited with
clearing organizations of $ 10.9billion and $
7.6billion primarily recorded in other assets on
the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Bank Subsidiary
Distributions The primary sources of funds for
cash distributions by the Corporation to its
shareholders are capital distributions received
from its bank subsidiaries, BANA and Bank of
America California, N.A. In 2020, the Corporation
received dividends of $ 10.3billion from BANA and
$ 62million from Bank of America California, N.A.
The amount of dividends that a subsidiary bank
may declare in a calendar year without OCC
approval is the subsidiary bank’s net profits for
that year combined with its retained net profits
for the preceding two years. Retained net
profits, as defined by the OCC, consist of net
income less dividends declared during the period.
In 2021, BANA can declare and pay dividends of
approximately $ 10.3billion to the Corporation
plus an additional amount equal to its retained
net profits for 2021 up to the date
of any such dividend declaration. Bank of America
California, N.A. can pay dividends of $
198million in 2021 plus an additional amount
equal to its retained net profits for 2021 up to
the date of any such dividend declaration.
NOTE 17 Employee Benefit Plans
Pension and Postretirement Plans The Corporation
sponsors a qualified noncontributory trusteed
pension plan (Qualified Pension Plan), a number
of noncontributory nonqualified pension plans,
and postretirement health and life plans that
cover eligible employees. Non-U.S. pension plans
sponsored by the Corporation vary based on the
country and local practices. The Qualified
Pension Plan has a balance guarantee feature for
account balances with participant-selected
investments, applied at the time a benefit
payment is made from the plan that effectively
provides principal protection for participant
balances transferred and certain compensation
credits. The Corporation is responsible for
funding any shortfall on the guarantee feature.
Benefits earned under the Qualified Pension Plan
have been frozen. Thereafter, the cash balance
accounts continue to earn investment credits or
interest credits in accordance with the terms of
the plan document. The Corporation has an annuity
contract that guarantees the payment of benefits
vested under a terminated U.S. pension plan
(Other Pension Plan). The Corporation, under a
supplemental agreement, may be responsible for or
benefit from actual experience and investment
performance of the annuity assets. The
Corporation made nocontribution under this
agreement in 2020 or 2019. Contributions may be
required in the future under this agreement. The
Corporation’s noncontributory, nonqualified
pension plans are unfunded and provide
supplemental defined pension benefits to certain
eligible employees. In addition to retirement
pension benefits, certain benefits-eligible
employees may become eligible to continue
participation as retirees in health care and/or
life insurance plans sponsored by the
Corporation. These plans are referred to as the
Postretirement Health and Life Plans. The Pension
and Postretirement Plans table summarizes the
changes in the fair value of plan assets, changes
in the projected benefit obligation (PBO), the
funded status of both the accumulated benefit
obligation (ABO) and the PBO, and the weighted-
average assumptions used to determine benefit
obligations for the pension plans and
postretirement plans at December 31, 2020 and
2019. The estimate of the Corporation’s PBO
associated with these plans considers various
actuarial assumptions, including assumptions for
mortality rates and discount rates. The discount
rate assumptions are derived from a cash flow
matching technique that utilizes rates that are
based on Aa-rated corporate bonds with cash flows
that match estimated benefit payments of each of
the plans. The decreases in the weighted-average
discount rates in 2020 and 2019 resulted in
increases to the PBO of approximately $
1.9billion and $ 2.2billion at December 31, 2020
and 2019. Significant gains and losses related to
changes in the PBO for 2020 and 2019 primarily
resulted from changes in the discount rate.

The Corporation’s estimate of its contributions to be made to the Non-U.S. Pension Plans,
Nonqualified and Other Pension Plans, and Postretirement Health and Life Plans in 2021 is $
29million, $ 93million and $ 14million, respectively. The Corporation does not expect to make a
contribution to the Qualified Pension Plan in 2021. It is the policy of the Corporation to fund no
less than the minimum funding amount required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
(ERISA). Pension Plans with ABO and PBO in excess of plan assets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 are
presented in the table below. For these plans, funding strategies vary due to legal requirements and
local practices.

The asset valuation method used to calculate the expected return on plan assets component of net
periodic benefit cost for the Qualified Pension Plan recognizes 60percent of the prior year’s market
gains or losses at the next measurement date with the remaining 40percent spread equally over the
subsequent four years. Gains and losses for all benefit plans except postretirement health care are
recognized in accordance with the standard amortization provisions of the applicable accounting
guidance. Net periodic postretirement health and life expense was determined using the “projected
unit credit” actuarial method. For the Postretirement Health and Life Plans, 50percent of the
unrecognized gain or loss at the beginning of the year (or at subsequent remeasurement) is recognized
on a level basis during the year. Assumed health care cost trend rates affect the postretirement
benefit obligation and benefit cost reported for the Postretirement Health and Life Plans. The
assumed health care cost trend rate used to measure the expected cost of benefits covered by the
Postretirement Health and Life Plans is 6.25percent for 2021, reducing in steps to 5.00percent in
2026 and later years. The Corporation’s net periodic benefit cost (income) recognized for the plans
is sensitive to the discount rate and expected return on plan assets. For the Qualified Pension Plan,
Non-U.S. Pension Plans, Nonqualified and Other Pension Plans, and Postretirement Health and Life
Plans, a 25 bp decline in discount rates and expected return on assets would not have had a
significant impact on the net periodic benefit cost for 2020.

Plan Assets The Qualified Pension Plan has been established as a retirement vehicle for participants,
and trusts have been established to secure benefits promised under the Qualified Pension Plan. The
Corporation’s policy is to invest the trust assets in a prudent manner for the exclusive purpose of
providing benefits to participants and defraying reasonable expenses of administration. The
Corporation’s investment strategy is designed to provide a total return that, over the long term,
increases the ratio of assets to liabilities. The strategy attempts to maximize the investment return
on assets at a level of risk deemed appropriate by the Corporation while complying with ERISA and any
applicable regulations and laws. The investment strategy utilizes asset allocation as a principal
determinant for establishing the risk/return profile of the assets. Asset allocation ranges are
established, periodically reviewed and adjusted as funding levels and liability characteristics
change. Active and passive investment managers are employed to help enhance the risk/return profile
of the assets. An additional aspect of the investment strategy used to minimize risk (part of the
asset allocation plan) includes matching the exposure of participant-selected investment measures.
The assets of the Non-U.S. Pension Plans are primarily attributable to a U.K. pension plan. This U.K.
pension plan’s assets are invested prudently so that the benefits promised to members are provided
with consideration given to the nature and the duration of the plans' liabilities. The selected asset
allocation strategy is designed to achieve a higher return than the lowest risk strategy. The
expected rate of return on plan assets assumption was developed through analysis of historical market
returns, historical asset class volatility and correlations, current market conditions, anticipated
future asset allocations, the funds’ past experience and expectations on potential future market
returns. The expected return on plan assets assumption is determined using the calculated market-
related value for the Qualified Pension Plan and the Other Pension Plan and the fair value for the
Non-U.S. Pension Plans and Postretirement Health and Life Plans. The expected return on plan assets
assumption represents a long-term average view of the performance of the assets in the Qualified
Pension Plan, the Non-U.S. Pension Plans, the Other Pension Plan, and Postretirement Health and Life
Plans, a return that may or may not be achieved during any one calendar year. The Other Pension Plan
is invested solely in an annuity contract, which is primarily invested in fixed-income securities
structured such that asset maturities match the duration of the plan’s obligations. The target
allocations for 2021 by asset category for the Qualified Pension Plan, Non-U.S. Pension Plans, and
Nonqualified and Other Pension Plans are presented in the following table. Equity securities for the
Qualified Pension Plan include common stock of the Corporation in the amounts of $ 274million (
1.26percent of total plan assets) and $ 315million ( 1.55percent of total plan assets) at December
31, 2020 and 2019.

Defined Contribution Plans The Corporation maintains qualified and non-qualified defined contribution
retirement plans. The Corporation recorded expense of $ 1.2billion, $ 1.0billion and $ 1.0billion in
2020, 2019 and 2018 related to the qualified defined contribution plans. At both December 31, 2020
and 2019, 189million shares of the Corporation’s common stock were held by these plans. Payments to
the plans for dividends on common stock were $ 138million, $ 133million and $ 115million in 2020,
2019 and 2018, respectively. Certain non-U.S. employees are covered under defined contribution
pension plans that are separately administered in accordance with local laws. NOTE 18 Stock-based
Compensation Plans The Corporation administers a number of equity compensation plans, with awards
being granted predominantly from the Bank of America Key Employee Equity Plan (KEEP). Under this
plan, 600million shares of the Corporation’s common stock are authorized to be used for grants of
awards. During 2020 and 2019, the Corporation granted 86million and 94million RSU awards to certain
employees under the KEEP. These RSUs were authorized to settle predominantly in shares of common
stock of the Corporation. Certain RSUs will be settled in cash or contain settlement provisions that
subject these awards to variable accounting whereby compensation expense is adjusted to fair value
based on changes in the share price of the Corporation’s common stock up to the settlement date. Of
the RSUs granted in 2020 and 2019, 61million and 71million will vest predominantly over three
yearswith most vesting occurring in one-third increments on each of the first three anniversaries of
the grant date provided that the employee remains continuously employed with the Corporation during
that time, and will be expensed ratably over the vesting period, net of estimated forfeitures, for
non-retirement eligible employees based on the grant-date fair value of the shares. For RSUs granted
to employees who are retirement eligible, the awards are deemed authorized as of the beginning of the
year preceding the grant date when the incentive award plans are generally approved. As a result, the
estimated value is expensed ratably over the year preceding the grant date. Additionally, 25million
and 23million of the RSUs granted in 2020 and 2019 will vest predominantly over four yearswith most
vesting occurring in one-fourth increments on each of the first four anniversaries of the grant date
provided that the employee remains continuously employed with the Corporation during that time, and
will be expensed ratably over the vesting period, net of estimated forfeitures, based on the grant-
date fair value of the shares. The compensation cost for the stock-based plans was $ 2.1billion, $
2.1billion and $ 1.8billion, and the related income tax benefit was $ 505million, $ 511million and $
433million for
2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. At December
31, 2020, there was an estimated $ 2.0billion of
total unrecognized compensation cost related to
certain share-based compensation awards that is
expected to be recognized over a period of up to
four years, with a weighted-average period of
2.2years.
Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units
The total fair value of restricted stock and
restricted stock units vested in 2020, 2019 and
2018 was $ 2.3billion, $ 2.6billion and $
2.3billion, respectively. The table below
presents the status at December 31, 2020 of the
share-settled restricted stock and restricted
stock units and changes during 2020.

information, see Note 14 – Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) . Other tax effects included
in OCI each period resulted in an expense of $ 1.5billion and $ 1.9billion in 2020 and 2019 and a
benefit of $ 1.2billion in 2018. Income tax expense for 2020, 2019 and 2018 varied from the amount
computed by applying the statutory income tax rate to income before income taxes. The Corporation’s
federal statutory tax rate was 21 percent for 2020, 2019 and 2018. A reconciliation of the expected
U.S. federal income tax expense, calculated by applying the federal statutory tax rate, to the

(1) The sum of the positions taken during prior
years differs from the $( 41) million, $( 613)
million and $ 144million in the Reconciliation of
Income Tax Expense table due to temporary items,
state items and jurisdictional offsets, as well
as the inclusion of interest in the
Reconciliation of Income Tax Expense table.
At December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the balance
of the Corporation’s UTBs which would, if
recognized, affect the Corporation’s effective
tax rate was $ 976million, $ 814million and $
1.6billion, respectively. Included in the UTB
balance are some items the recognition of which
would not affect the effective tax rate, such as
the tax effect of certain temporary differences,
the portion of gross state UTBs that would be
offset by the tax benefit of the associated
federal deduction and the portion of gross
non-U.S. UTBs that would be offset by tax
reductions in other jurisdictions.
It is reasonably possible that the UTB balance
may decrease by as much as $ 166million during
the next 12 months, since resolved items will be
removed from the balance whether their resolution
results in payment or recognition. The
Corporation recognized interest expense of $
9million in 2020, an interest benefit of $
19million in 2019 and interest expense of $
43million in 2018. At December 31, 2020 and 2019,
the Corporation’s accrual for interest and
penalties that related to income taxes, net of
taxes and remittances, was $ 130million and $
147million. The Corporation files income tax
returns in more than 100state and non-U.S.
jurisdictions each year. The IRS and other tax
authorities in countries and states in which the
Corporation has significant business operations
examine tax returns periodically (continuously in
some jurisdictions). The following table

CECL accounting standard. The transition
adjustment included a tax benefit of $ 760million
in retained earnings, which increased deferred
tax assets by a corresponding amount.
The table below summarizes the deferred tax

(2) The net operating losses and related
valuation allowances for U.S. states before
considering the benefit of federal deductions
were $ 1.6billion and $ 733million.
Management concluded that novaluation allowance
was necessary to reduce the deferred tax assets
related to the U.K. NOL carryforwards and U.S.
federal and certain state NOL carryforwards since
estimated future taxable income will be
sufficient to utilize these assets prior to their
expiration. The majority of the Corporation’s
U.K. net deferred tax assets, which consist
primarily of NOLs, are expected to be realized by
certain subsidiaries over an extended number of
years. Management’s conclusion is supported by
financial results, profit forecasts for the
relevant entities and the indefinite period to
carry forward NOLs. However, a material change in
those estimates could lead management to reassess
such valuation allowance conclusions.
At December 31, 2020, U.S. federal income taxes
had not been provided on approximately $
5.0billion of temporary
differences associated with investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries that are essentially permanent in
duration. If the Corporation were to record the associated deferred tax liability, the amount would
be approximately $ 1.0billion. NOTE 20 Fair Value Measurements Under applicable accounting standards,
fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a
liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in
an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The Corporation
determines the fair values of its financial instruments under applicable accounting standards that
require an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable
inputs. The Corporation categorizes its financial instruments into three levels based on the
established fair value hierarchy and conducts a review of fair value hierarchy classifications on a
quarterly basis. Transfers into or out of fair value hierarchy classifications are made if the
significant inputs used in the financial models measuring the fair values of the assets and
liabilities become unobservable or observable in the current marketplace. For more information
regarding the fair value hierarchy and how the Corporation measures fair value, see Note 1 – Summary
of Significant Accounting Principles . The Corporation accounts for certain financial instruments
under the fair value option. For more information, see Note 21 – Fair Value Option . Valuation
Techniques The following sections outline the valuation methodologies for the Corporation’s assets
and liabilities. While the Corporation believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent
with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the
fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the
reporting date. During 2020, there were no significant changes to valuation approaches or techniques
that had, or are expected to have, a material impact on the Corporation’s consolidated financial
position or results of operations. Trading Account Assets and Liabilities and Debt Securities The
fair values of trading account assets and liabilities are primarily based on actively traded markets
where prices are based on either direct market quotes or observed transactions. The fair values of
debt securities are generally based on quoted market prices or market prices for similar assets.
Liquidity is a significant factor in the determination of the fair values of trading account assets
and liabilities and debt securities. Market price quotes may not be readily available for some
positions such as positions within a market sector where trading activity has slowed significantly or
ceased. Some of these instruments are valued using a discounted cash flow model, which estimates the
fair value of the securities using internal credit risk, and interest rate and prepayment risk models
that incorporate management’s best estimate of current key assumptions such as default rates, loss
severity and prepayment rates. Principal and interest cash flows are discounted using an observable
discount rate for similar instruments with adjustments that management believes a market participant
would consider in determining fair value for the specific security. Other instruments are valued
using a net asset value approach which considers the value of the underlying securities. Underlying
assets are valued using external pricing services, where available, or matrix pricing
 Bank of America154 
based on the vintages and ratings. Situations of illiquidity generally are triggered by the market’s
perception of credit uncertainty regarding a single company or a specific market sector. In these
instances, fair value is determined based on limited available market information and other factors,
principally from reviewing the issuer’s financial statements and changes in credit ratings made by
one or more rating agencies. Derivative Assets and Liabilities The fair values of derivative assets
and liabilities traded in the OTC market are determined using quantitative models that utilize
multiple market inputs including interest rates, prices and indices to generate continuous yield or
pricing curves and volatility factors to value the position. The majority of market inputs are
actively quoted and can be validated through external sources, including brokers, market transactions
and third-party pricing services. When third-party pricing services are used, the methods and
assumptions are reviewed by the Corporation. Estimation risk is greater for derivative asset and
liability positions that are either option-based or have longer maturity dates where observable
market inputs are less readily available, or are unobservable, in which case, quantitative-based
extrapolations of rate, price or index scenarios are used in determining fair values. The fair values
of derivative assets and liabilities include adjustments for market liquidity, counterparty credit
quality and other instrument-specific factors, where appropriate. In addition, the Corporation
incorporates within its fair value measurements of OTC derivatives a valuation adjustment to reflect
the credit risk associated with the net position. Positions are netted by counterparty, and fair
value for net long exposures is adjusted for counterparty credit risk while the fair value for net
short exposures is adjusted for the Corporation’s own credit risk. The Corporation also incorporates
FVA within its fair value measurements to include funding costs on uncollateralized derivatives and
derivatives where the Corporation is not permitted to use the collateral it receives. An estimate of
severity of loss is also used in the determination of fair value, primarily based on market data.
Loans and Loan Commitments The fair values of loans and loan commitments are based on market prices,
where available, or discounted cash flow analyses using market-based credit spreads of comparable
debt instruments or credit derivatives of the specific borrower or comparable borrowers. Results of
discounted cash flow analyses may be adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect other market conditions or
the perceived credit risk of the borrower. Mortgage Servicing Rights The fair values of MSRs are
primarily determined using an option-adjusted spread valuation approach, which factors in prepayment
risk to determine the fair value of MSRs. This approach consists of projecting servicing cash flows
under multiple interest rate scenarios and discounting these cash flows using risk-adjusted discount
rates. Loans Held-for-sale The fair values of LHFS are based on quoted market prices, where
available, or are determined by discounting estimated cash flows using interest rates approximating
the Corporation’s current origination rates for similar loans adjusted to reflect the inherent credit
risk. The borrower-specific credit risk is embedded within the quoted market prices or is implied by
considering loan performance when selecting comparables. Short-term Borrowings and Long-term Debt The
Corporation issues structured liabilities that have coupons or repayment terms linked to the
performance of debt or equity securities, interest rates, indices, currencies or commodities. The
fair values of these structured liabilities are estimated using quantitative models for the combined
derivative and debt portions of the notes. These models incorporate observable and, in some
instances, unobservable inputs including security prices, interest rate yield curves, option
volatility, currency, commodity or equity rates and correlations among these inputs. The Corporation
also considers the impact of its own credit spread in determining the discount rate used to value
these liabilities. The credit spread is determined by reference to observable spreads in the
secondary bond market. Securities Financing Agreements The fair values of certain reverse repurchase
agreements, repurchase agreements and securities borrowed transactions are determined using
quantitative models, including discounted cash flow models that require the use of multiple market
inputs including interest rates and spreads to generate continuous yield or pricing curves, and
volatility factors. The majority of market inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through
external sources, including brokers, market transactions and third-party pricing services. Deposits
The fair values of deposits are determined using quantitative models, including discounted cash flow
models that require the use of multiple market inputs including interest rates and spreads to
generate continuous yield or pricing curves, and volatility factors. The majority of market inputs
are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources, including brokers, market
transactions and third-party pricing services. The Corporation considers the impact of its own credit
spread in the valuation of these liabilities. The credit risk is determined by reference to
observable credit spreads in the secondary cash market. Asset-backed Secured Financings The fair
values of asset-backed secured financings are based on external broker bids, where available, or are
determined by discounting estimated cash flows using interest rates approximating the Corporation’s
current origination rates for similar loans adjusted to reflect the inherent credit risk.

(1) Amounts represent the impact of legally enforceable master netting agreements and also cash
collateral held or placed with the same counterparties.
(2) Includes $ 26.7billion of GSE obligations.
(3) Includes securities with a fair value of $ 14.7billion that were segregated in compliance with
securities regulations or deposited with clearing organizations. This amount is included in the
parenthetical disclosure on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
(4) Includes MSRs of $ 1.5billion which are classified as Level 3 assets.
(5) Total recurring Level 3 assets were 0.42percent of total consolidated assets, and total recurring
Level 3 liabilities were 0.27percent of total consolidated liabilities.
 157Bank of America 
The following tables present a reconciliation of all assets and liabilities measured at fair value on
a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) during 2020, 2019 and 2018,
including net realized and unrealized gains (losses) included in earnings and accumulated OCI.
Transfers into Level 3 occur primarily due to decreased price observability, and transfers out of
Level 3 occur primarily due to increased price observability. Transfers occur on a regular basis for
long-term debt instruments due to changes in the impact of unobservable inputs on the value of the
embedded derivative in relation to the instrument as a whole.

In the previous tables, instruments backed by residential and commercial real estate assets include
RMBS, commercial MBS, whole loans and mortgage CDOs. Commercial loans, debt securities and other
include corporate CLOs and CDOs, commercial loans and bonds, and securities backed by non-real estate
assets. Structured liabilities primarily include equity-linked notes that are accounted for under the
fair value option. The Corporation uses multiple market approaches in valuing certain of its Level 3
financial instruments. For example, market comparables and discounted cash flows are used together.
For a given product, such as corporate debt securities, market comparables may be used to estimate
some of the unobservable inputs and then these inputs are incorporated into a discounted cash flow
model. Therefore, the balances disclosed encompass both of these techniques. The level of aggregation
and diversity within the products disclosed in the tables result in certain ranges of inputs being
wide and unevenly distributed across asset and liability categories. Uncertainty of Fair Value
Measurements from Unobservable Inputs Loans and Securities A significant increase in market yields,
default rates, loss severities or duration would have resulted in a significantly lower fair value
for long positions. Short positions would have been impacted in a directionally opposite way. The
impact of changes in prepayment speeds would have resulted in differing impacts depending on the
seniority of the instrument and, in the case of CLOs, whether prepayments can be reinvested. A
significant increase in price would have resulted in a significantly higher fair value for long
positions, and short positions would have been impacted in a directionally opposite way. Structured
Liabilities and Derivatives For credit derivatives, a significant increase in market yield, upfront
points (i.e., a single upfront payment made by a protection buyer at inception), credit spreads,
default rates or loss severities would have resulted in a significantly lower fair value for
protection sellers and higher fair value for protection buyers. The impact of changes in prepayment
speeds would have resulted in differing impacts depending on the seniority of the instrument.
Structured credit derivatives are impacted by credit correlation. Default correlation is a parameter
that describes the degree of dependence among credit default rates within a credit portfolio that
underlies a credit derivative instrument. The sensitivity of this input on the fair value varies
depending on the level of subordination of the tranche. For senior tranches that are net purchases of
protection, a significant increase in default correlation would have resulted in a significantly
higher fair value. Net short protection positions would have been impacted in a directionally
opposite way. For equity derivatives, commodity derivatives, interest rate derivatives and structured
liabilities, a significant change in long-dated rates and volatilities and correlation inputs (i.e.,
the degree of correlation between an equity security and an index, between two different commodities,
between two different interest rates, or between interest rates and foreign exchange rates) would
have resulted in a significant impact to the fair value; however, the magnitude and direction of the
impact depend on whether the Corporation is long or short the exposure. For structured liabilities, a
significant increase in yield or decrease in price would have resulted in a significantly lower fair
value. Nonrecurring Fair Value The Corporation holds certain assets that are measured at fair value
only in certain situations (e.g., the impairment of an asset), and these measurements are referred to
herein as nonrecurring. The amounts below represent assets still held as of the reporting date for
which a nonrecurring fair value adjustment was recorded during 2020, 2019 and 2018.

the cost-to-service rate.
NOTE 21 Fair Value Option
Loans and Loan Commitments The Corporation elects
to account for certain loans and loan commitments
that exceed the Corporation’s single-name credit
risk concentration guidelines under the fair
value option. Lending commitments are actively
managed and, as appropriate, credit risk for
these lending relationships may be mitigated
through the use of credit derivatives, with the
Corporation’s public side credit view and market
perspectives determining the size and timing of
the hedging activity. These credit derivatives do
not meet the requirements for designation as
accounting hedges and therefore are carried at
fair value. The fair value option allows the
Corporation to carry these loans and loan
commitments at fair value, which is more
consistent with management’s view of the
underlying economics and the manner in which they
are managed. In addition, the fair value option
allows the Corporation to reduce the accounting
volatility that would otherwise result from the
asymmetry created by accounting for the financial
instruments at historical cost and the credit
derivatives at fair value. Loans Held-for-sale
The Corporation elects to account for residential
mortgage LHFS, commercial mortgage LHFS and
certain other LHFS under the fair value option.
These loans are actively managed and monitored
and, as appropriate, certain market risks of the
loans may be mitigated through the use of
derivatives. The Corporation has elected not to
designate the derivatives as qualifying
accounting hedges, and therefore, they are
carried at fair value. The changes in fair value
of the loans are largely
offset by changes in the fair value of the
derivatives. The fair value option allows the
Corporation to reduce the accounting volatility
that would otherwise result from the asymmetry
created by accounting for the financial
instruments at the lower of cost or fair value
and the derivatives at fair value. The
Corporation has not elected to account for
certain other LHFS under the fair value option
primarily because these loans are floating-rate
loans that are not hedged using derivative
instruments. Loans Reported as Trading Account
Assets The Corporation elects to account for
certain loans that are held for the purpose of
trading and are risk-managed on a fair value
basis under the fair value option. Other Assets
The Corporation elects to account for certain
long-term fixed-rate margin loans that are hedged
with derivatives under the fair value option.
Election of the fair value option allows the
Corporation to reduce the accounting volatility
that would otherwise result from the asymmetry
created by accounting for the financial
instruments at historical cost and the
derivatives at fair value. Securities Financing
Agreements The Corporation elects to account for
certain securities financing agreements,
including resale and repurchase agreements, under
the fair value option. These elections include
certain agreements collateralized by the U.S.
government and its agencies, which are generally
short-dated and have minimal interest rate risk.
 163Bank of America 
Long-term Deposits The Corporation elects to account for certain long-term fixed-rate and rate-linked
deposits that are hedged with derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting. Election of the
fair value option allows the Corporation to reduce the accounting volatility that would otherwise
result from the asymmetry created by accounting for the financial instruments at historical cost and
the derivatives at fair value. The Corporation has not elected to carry other long-term deposits at
fair value because they are not hedged using derivatives. Short-term Borrowings The Corporation
elects to account for certain short-term borrowings, primarily short-term structured liabilities,
under the fair value option because this debt is risk-managed on a fair value basis. The Corporation
elects to account for certain asset-backed secured financings, which are also classified in short-
term borrowings, under the fair value option. Election of the fair value option allows the
Corporation to reduce the accounting volatility that would otherwise result from the asymmetry
created by accounting for the asset-backed secured financings at historical cost and the
corresponding mortgage LHFS securing these financings at fair value. Long-term Debt The Corporation
elects to account for certain long-term debt, primarily structured liabilities, under the fair value
option. This long-term debt is either risk-managed on a fair value basis or the related hedges do not
qualify for hedge accounting. Fair Value Option Elections The following tables provide information
about the fair value carrying amount and the contractual principal outstanding of assets and
liabilities accounted for under the fair value option at December 31, 2020 and 2019, and information
about where changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities accounted for under the fair value
option are included in the Consolidated Statement of Income for 2020, 2019 and 2018.

NOTE 22 Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Financial instruments are classified within the
fair value hierarchy using the methodologies
described in Note 20 – Fair Value Measurements .
Certain loans, deposits, long-term debt, unfunded
lending commitments and other financial
instruments are accounted for under the fair
value option. For more information, see Note 21 –
Fair Value Option. The following disclosures
include financial instruments that are not
carried at fair value or only a portion of the
ending balance is carried at fair value on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet. Short-term Financial
Instruments The carrying value of short-term
financial instruments, including cash and cash
equivalents, certain time deposits placed and
other short-term investments, federal funds sold
and purchased,
certain resale and repurchase agreements and
short-term borrowings, approximates the fair
value of these instruments. These financial
instruments generally expose the Corporation to
limited credit risk and have no stated maturities
or have short-term maturities and carry interest
rates that approximate market. The Corporation
accounts for certain resale and repurchase
agreements under the fair value option. Under the
fair value hierarchy, cash and cash equivalents
are classified as Level 1. Time deposits placed
and other short-term investments, such as U.S.
government securities and short-term commercial
paper, are classified as Level 1 or Level 2.
Federal funds sold and purchased are classified
as Level 2. Resale and repurchase agreements are
classified as Level 2 because they are generally
short-dated and/or variable-rate instruments
collateralized by U.S. government or agency
securities. Short-term borrowings are classified
as Level 2.

(2) The carrying value of commercial unfunded
lending commitments is included in accrued
expenses and other liabilities on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Corporation does
not estimate the fair value of consumer unfunded
lending commitments because, in many instances,
the Corporation can reduce or cancel these
commitments by providing notice to the borrower.
For more information on commitments, see Note 12
– Commitments and Contingencies .
NOTE 23 Business Segment Information The Corporation reports its results of operations through the
following fourbusiness segments: Consumer Banking , GWIM , Global Banking and Global Markets , with
the remaining operations recorded in All Other . Consumer Banking Consumer Banking offers a
diversified range of credit, banking and investment products and services to consumers and small
businesses. Consumer Banking product offerings include traditional savings accounts, money market
savings accounts, CDs and IRAs, checking accounts, and investment accounts and products, as well as
credit and debit cards, residential mortgages and home equity loans, and direct and indirect loans to
consumers and small businesses in the U.S. Consumer Banking includes the impact of servicing
residential mortgages and home equity loans in the core portfolio. Global Wealth & Investment
Management GWIM provides a high-touch client experience through a network of financial advisors
focused on clients with over $250,000 in total investable assets, including tailored solutions to
meet clients’ needs through a full set of investment management, brokerage, banking and retirement
products. GWIM also provides comprehensive wealth management solutions targeted to high net worth and
ultra high net worth clients, as well as customized solutions to meet clients’ wealth structuring,
investment management, trust and banking needs, including specialty asset management services.
Global Banking Global Banking provides a wide range of lending-related products and services,
integrated working capital management and treasury solutions, and underwriting and advisory services
through the Corporation’s network of offices and client relationship teams. Global Banking also
provides investment banking products to clients. The economics of certain investment banking and
underwriting activities are shared primarily between Global Banking and Global Markets under an
internal revenue-sharing arrangement. Global Banking clients generally include middle-market
companies, commercial real estate firms, not-for-profit companies, large global corporations,
financial institutions, leasing clients, and mid-sized U.S.-based businesses requiring customized and
integrated financial advice and solutions. Global Markets Global Markets offers sales and trading
services and research services to institutional clients across fixed-income, credit, currency,
commodity and equity businesses. Global Markets provides market-making, financing, securities
clearing, settlement and custody services globally to institutional investor clients in support of
their investing and trading activities. Global Markets product coverage includes securities and
derivative products in both the primary and secondary markets. Global Markets also works with
commercial and corporate clients to provide risk management products. As a result of market-making
activities, Global Markets may be required to manage risk in a broad range of financial products. In
addition, the economics of certain investment banking and underwriting activities are shared
primarily between Global Markets and Global Banking under an internal revenue-sharing arrangement.
All Other All Other consists of ALM activities, equity investments, non-core mortgage loans and
servicing activities, liquidating businesses and certain expenses not otherwise allocated to business
segments. ALM activities encompass certain residential mortgages, debt securities, interest rate and
foreign currency risk management activities. Substantially all of the results of ALM activities are
allocated to the business segments. Basis of Presentation The management accounting and reporting
process derives segment and business results by utilizing allocation methodologies for revenue and
expense. The net income derived for the businesses is dependent upon revenue and cost allocations
using an activity-based costing model, funds transfer pricing, and other methodologies and
assumptions management believes are appropriate to reflect the results of the business. Total
revenue, net of interest expense, includes net interest income on an FTE basis and noninterest
income. The adjustment of net interest income to an FTE basis results in a corresponding increase in
income tax expense. The segment results also reflect certain revenue and expense methodologies that
are utilized to determine net income. The net interest income of the businesses includes the results
of a funds transfer pricing process that matches assets and liabilities with similar interest rate
sensitivity and maturity characteristics. In segments where the total of liabilities and equity
exceeds assets, which are generally deposit-taking segments, the Corporation allocates assets to
match liabilities. Net interest income of the business segments also includes an allocation of
 Bank of America166 
net interest income generated by certain of the Corporation’s ALM activities. The Corporation’s ALM
activities include an overall interest rate risk management strategy that incorporates the use of
various derivatives and cash instruments to manage fluctuations in earnings and capital that are
caused by interest rate volatility. The Corporation’s goal is to manage interest rate sensitivity so
that movements in interest rates do not significantly adversely affect earnings and capital. The
results of substantially all of the Corporation’s ALM activities are allocated to the business
segments and fluctuate based on the performance of the ALM activities. ALM activities include
external product pricing decisions including deposit pricing strategies, the effects of the
Corporation’s internal funds transfer pricing process and the net effects of other ALM activities.
Certain expenses not directly attributable to a specific business segment are allocated to the
segments. The costs of certain centralized or shared functions are allocated based on methodologies
that reflect utilization. The following table presents net income (loss) and the components thereto
(with net interest income on an FTE basis for the business segments, All Other and the total
Corporation) for 2020, 2019 and 2018, and total assets at December 31, 2020 and 2019 for each
business segment, as well as All Other.

NOTE 25 Performance by Geographical Area
The Corporation’s operations are highly
integrated with operations in both U.S. and
non-U.S. markets. The non-U.S. business
activities are largely conducted in Europe, the
Middle East and Africa and in Asia. The
Corporation identifies its geographic performance
based on the business unit structure used to
manage the capital or expense deployed in the
region
as applicable. This requires certain judgments
related to the allocation of revenue so that
revenue can be appropriately matched with the
related capital or expense deployed in the
region. Certain asset, liability, income and
expense amounts have been allocated to arrive at
total assets, total revenue, net of interest
expense, income before income taxes and net
income by geographic area as presented below.

 Glossary 
Alt-A Mortgage – A type of U.S. mortgage that is
considered riskier than A-paper, or “prime,” and
less risky than “subprime,” the riskiest
category. Typically, Alt-A mortgages are
characterized by borrowers with less than full
documentation, lower credit scores and higher
LTVs.
Assets Under Management (AUM) – The total market
value of assets under the investment advisory
and/or discretion of GWIM which generate asset
management fees based on a percentage of the
assets’ market values. AUM reflects assets that
are generally managed for institutional, high net
worth and retail clients, and are distributed
through various investment products including
mutual funds, other commingled vehicles and
separate accounts.
Banking Book – All on- and off-balance sheet
financial instruments of the Corporation except
for those positions that are held for trading
purposes.
Brokerage and Other Assets – Non-discretionary
client assets which are held in brokerage
accounts or held for safekeeping.
Committed Credit Exposure – Any funded portion of
a facility plus the unfunded portion of a
facility on which the lender is legally bound to
advance funds during a specified period under
prescribed conditions.
Credit Derivatives – Contractual agreements that
provide protection against a specified credit
event on one or more referenced obligations.
Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) – A portfolio
adjustment required to properly reflect the
counterparty credit risk exposure as part of the
fair value of derivative instruments.
Debit Valuation Adjustment (DVA) – A portfolio
adjustment required to properly reflect the
Corporation’s own credit risk exposure as part of
the fair value of derivative instruments and/or
structured liabilities.
Funding Valuation Adjustment (FVA) – A portfolio
adjustment required to include funding costs on
uncollateralized derivatives and derivatives
where the Corporation is not permitted to use the
collateral it receives.
Interest Rate Lock Commitment (IRLC) – Commitment
with a loan applicant in which the loan terms are
guaranteed for a designated period of time
subject to credit approval.
Letter of Credit – A document issued on behalf of
a customer to a third party promising to pay the
third party upon presentation of specified
documents. A letter of credit effectively
substitutes the issuer’s credit for that of the
customer.
Loan-to-value (LTV) – A commonly used credit
quality metric. LTV is calculated as the
outstanding carrying value of the loan divided by
the estimated value of the property securing the
loan.
Margin Receivable – An extension of credit
secured by eligible securities in certain
brokerage accounts.
Matched Book – Repurchase and resale agreements
or securities borrowed and loaned transactions
where the overall asset and liability position is
similar in size and/or maturity. Generally, these
are entered into to accommodate customers where
the Corporation earns the interest rate spread.
Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSR) – The right to
service a mortgage loan when the underlying loan
is sold or securitized. Servicing includes
collections for principal, interest and escrow
payments from borrowers and accounting for and
remitting principal and interest payments to
investors.
Nonperforming Loans and Leases – Includes loans
and leases that have been placed on nonaccrual
status, including nonaccruing loans whose
contractual terms have been restructured in a
manner that grants a concession to a borrower
experiencing financial difficulties.
Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) – A framework
established by the U.S. banking regulators
requiring banks to maintain certain levels of
regulatory capital ratios, comprised of five
categories of capitalization: “well capitalized,”
“adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,”
“significantly undercapitalized” and “critically
undercapitalized.” Insured depository
institutions that fail to meet certain of these
capital levels are subject to increasingly strict
limits on their activities, including their
ability to make capital distributions, pay
management compensation, grow assets and take
other actions.
Subprime Loans – Although a standard industry
definition for subprime loans (including subprime
mortgage loans) does not exist, the Corporation
defines subprime loans as specific product
offerings for higher risk borrowers.
Troubled Debt Restructurings (TDRs) – Loans whose
contractual terms have been restructured in a
manner that grants a concession to a borrower
experiencing financial difficulties. Certain
consumer loans for which a binding offer to
restructure has been extended are also classified
as TDRs.
Value-at-Risk (VaR) – VaR is a model that
simulates the value of a portfolio under a range
of hypothetical scenarios in order to generate a
distribution of potential gains and losses. VaR
represents the loss the portfolio is expected to
experience with a given confidence level based on
historical data. A VaR model is an effective tool
in estimating ranges of potential gains and
losses on our trading portfolios.
