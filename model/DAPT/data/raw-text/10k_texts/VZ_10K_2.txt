 General 
Verizon Communications Inc. (the Company) is a holding company that, acting through its subsidiaries
(together with the Company, collectively, Verizon), is one of the world’s leading providers of
communications, technology, information and entertainment products and services to consumers,
businesses and government entities. With a presence around the world, we offer data, video and voice
services and solutions on our networks and platforms that are designed to meet customers’ demand for
mobility, reliable network connectivity and security.
Our principal executive offices are located at 1095 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York 10036
(telephone number 212-395-1000).
We have two reportable segments that we operate and manage as strategic business units - Verizon
Consumer Group (Consumer) and Verizon Business Group (Business).
 Verizon Consumer Group 
Our Consumer segment provides consumer-focused wireless and wireline communications services and
products. Our wireless services are provided across one of the most extensive wireless networks in
the United States (U.S.) under the Verizon family of brands and through wholesale and other
arrangements. We also provide fixed wireless access (FWA) broadband through our fifth-generation (5G)
or fourth-generation (4G) Long-Term Evolution (LTE) networks as an alternative to traditional
landline internet access. Our wireline services are provided in nine states in the Mid-Atlantic and
Northeastern U.S., as well as Washington D.C., over our 100% fiber-optic network through our Verizon
Fios product portfolio and over a traditional copper-based network to customers who are not served by
Fios.
In 2023, the Consumer segment’s revenues were $101.6 billion, representing approximately 76% of
Verizon’s consolidated revenues. As of December 31, 2023, Consumer had approximately 115 million
wireless retail connections (including FWA), of which 82% are postpaid connections. In addition, at
December 31, 2023, Consumer had approximately 9 million total broadband connections (which includes
Fios internet, Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) and FWA connections), and approximately 3 million Fios
video connections.
 Verizon Business Group 
Our Business segment provides wireless and wireline communications services and products, including
FWA broadband, data, video and conferencing services, corporate networking solutions, security and
managed network services, local and long distance voice services and network access to deliver
various Internet of Things (IoT) services and products. We provide these products and services to
businesses, government customers and wireless and wireline carriers across the U.S. and a subset of
these products and services to customers around the world.
In 2023, the Business segment's revenues were $30.1 billion, representing approximately 22% of
Verizon’s consolidated revenues. As of December 31, 2023, Business had approximately 30 million
wireless retail postpaid connections (including FWA) and approximately 2 million total broadband
connections (which includes Fios internet, DSL and FWA connections).
Additional discussion of our reportable segments is included in Item 7. under the headings
"Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Overview"
and "— Segment Results of Operations" and in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements
included in this Annual Report.
 Service and Product Offerings 
Our Consumer segment's wireless and wireline products and services are available to our retail
customers, as well as resellers that purchase wireless network access from us on a wholesale basis.
Our Business segment’s wireless and wireline products and services are organized by the primary
customer groups targeted by these offerings: Enterprise and Public Sector, Business Markets and
Other, and Wholesale.
 Wireless 
We offer wireless services and equipment to both Consumer customers and Business customers.
 Wireless Services 
Our Consumer and Business segments provide a wide variety of wireless services accessible on a broad
range of devices. Customers can obtain our wireless services on a postpaid or prepaid basis. Retail

may include monthly wireless services for a variety of connected devices. Our postpaid service is
generally billed one month in advance for a monthly access charge in return for access to and usage
of network services. Our prepaid service is offered only to Consumer customers and enables
individuals to obtain wireless services without credit verification by paying for all services in
advance. As of December 31, 2023, we had 94 million postpaid connections and 21 million prepaid
connections, representing approximately 82% and 18% of our Consumer wireless retail connections,
respectively.
Access to the internet is available on all smartphones and nearly all basic phones. In addition, our
customers can access the internet at broadband speeds on notebook computers, tablets and smartwatches
that are either wireless-enabled or that are used in conjunction with separate dedicated devices that
provide a mobile Wi-Fi connection.
Historically, customers on our fixed-term service plans paid higher access fees for their wireless
service in exchange for the ability to purchase their wireless devices at subsidized prices. We no
longer offer Consumer customers new fixed-term, subsidized service plans for devices; however, we
continue to offer subsidized plans to our Business customers.
We also provide FWA broadband through our 5G or 4G LTE wireless networks to our Consumer and Business
customers. FWA enables fixed broadband access using radio frequencies instead of cables and can be
used to connect homes and businesses to the internet. As of December 31, 2023, we had approximately
3.1 million FWA broadband connections.
 Wireless Equipment 
Consumer and Business offer several categories of wireless equipment to customers, including a
variety of smartphones and other handsets, wireless-enabled internet devices, such as tablets, and

 Global Network and Technology 
Our global network architecture is used by Consumer and Business. Our network technology platforms
include both wireless and wireline technologies.
 Network Evolution 
We are transforming the architecture of our networks into our next-generation multi-use platform,
which we call the Intelligent Edge Network. This technology enhances applications by hosting them at
the end of the network, closer to devices and end points, which lowers response time and boosts
performance.
We expect that this new architecture will simplify operations by eliminating legacy network elements,
speed the deployment of 5G wireless technology and create new opportunities in the business market in
a cost-efficient manner.
 5G 
Over the past several years, we have been leading the development of 5G wireless technology industry
standards and the ecosystems for fixed and mobile 5G wireless services. 5G technology enables higher
throughput and lower latency than 4G LTE technology and allows our networks to handle more traffic as
the number of internet-connected devices grows.
We provide high quality 5G wireless service utilizing millimeter wave and C-Band spectrum. Other
licensed spectrum bands are used to support our 5G service. In January 2022, we began rapidly
deploying our C-Band spectrum, which, as of December 31, 2023, covers approximately 242 million
people in the U.S. We obtained full access to our C-Band spectrum in August 2023 and will continue
deploying this spectrum across the continental U.S. Our FWA broadband services also leverage the 5G
network and our expanding C-Band footprint, in addition to our 4G FWA offerings.
 4G LTE 
The wireless network technology platform that carries about half of our wireless traffic is 4G LTE.
As of December 31, 2023, our 4G LTE network covers approximately 330 million people, excluding those
in areas served by our LTE in Rural America partners. Under this program, we have collaborated with
wireless carriers in rural areas to build and operate a 4G LTE network using each carrier’s network
assets with our core 4G LTE equipment and 700 Megahertz (MHz) C Block and Advanced Wireless Services
(AWS) spectrum. LTE Home Internet, our home broadband internet service leverages the Verizon 4G LTE
network.
 Wireless Network Reliability and Build-Out 
We consider the reliability, speed, capacity and coverage of our wireless network to be key factors
for our continued success. We believe that steady and consistent network and platform investments
provide the foundation for innovative products and services. As we design and deploy our network, we
focus on the number of successful data sessions the network enables, delivering on our advertised
throughput speeds, and the number of calls that are connected on the first attempt and completed
without being dropped. We utilize three strategies to maintain the quality of our network: increasing
the density of our network elements, deploying new technologies as they are developed and putting
additional wireless spectrum into service.
We are densifying our networks by utilizing macro and small cell technology, in-building solutions
and distributed antenna systems. Network densification enables us to add capacity to address
increasing mobile video consumption and the growing demand for IoT products and services on our 4G
LTE and 5G networks. We are also utilizing existing network capabilities to handle increased traffic
without interrupting the quality of the customer experience. We continue to deploy advanced
technologies to increase both network capacity and data rates.
In order to deploy our 5G network and build and upgrade our existing 4G LTE network, we must secure
rights to a large number of sites and obtain zoning and other governmental approvals and fiber
facilities for our macro and small cells, in-building systems and antennas and related radio
equipment that comprise distributed antenna systems. We have relationships with a wide variety of
vendors that supply various products and services that support our wireless network operations. We
utilize tower site management firms as lessors or managers of a portion of our existing leased and
owned tower sites.
Our networks in the U.S. include various elements of redundancy designed to enhance the reliability
of the services provided to our customers. To mitigate the impact of power disruptions on our
operations, we have battery backup at every switch and every macro cell. We also utilize backup
generators at a majority of our macro cells and at every switch location. In addition, we have a
fleet of portable backup generators that can be deployed if needed. We further enhance reliability by
using a fully redundant Multiprotocol Label Switching backbone network in critical locations.
In addition to our own network coverage, we have roaming agreements with a number of wireless service
providers to enable our customers to receive wireless service in nearly all other areas in the U.S.
where wireless service is available. We also offer a variety of international wireless voice and data
services to our customers through roaming arrangements with wireless service providers outside the
U.S.

 Fios 
Residential broadband service has seen significant growth in bandwidth demand over the past several
years, and we believe that demand will continue to grow. We expect that the continued emergence of
new video services, new data applications and the proliferation of IP devices in the home will
continue to drive new network requirements for increased data speeds and throughput. We believe that
the Passive Optical Network (PON) technology underpinning Fios positions us well to meet these
demands in a cost-effective and efficient manner.
While deployed initially as a consumer broadband network, our PON infrastructure is also experiencing
more widespread application in the Business segment, especially as businesses increasingly migrate to
Ethernet-based access services.
 Global IP 
Verizon owns and operates one of the largest global fiber-optic networks in the world, providing
connectivity to Business customers in more than 190 countries. Our global IP network includes long-
haul, metro and submarine assets that enable and support international operations.
Global business is rapidly evolving to an "everything-as-a-service" model in which Business customers
seek cloud-based, converged enterprise solutions delivered securely via managed and professional
services. We are continuing to deploy packet optical transport technology in order to create a global
network platform to meet this demand.
 Spectrum 
The spectrum licenses we hold can be used for mobile and fixed wireless voice, video and data
communications services. We are licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to provide
these wireless services on the following low and mid-band spectrum in areas that collectively cover
nearly all of the population of the U.S.: (i) the 700 MHz Upper C block, (ii) Cellular spectrum (850
MHz), (iii) Personal Communication Services (PCS) spectrum (1900 MHz), (iv) AWS 1 and AWS 3 bands
(1700 MHz uplink and 2100 MHz downlink), and (v) the 3.7 GHz band ("C-Band"). We also hold spectrum
licenses in the 28, Upper 37 and 39 GHz bands, known as millimeter wave spectrum, and utilize both
Priority Access Licenses (PALs) and General Authorized Access (GAA) in the 3.5 GHz band (Citizens
Broadband Radio Service).
We use our low and mid-band spectrum to provide wireless services. Millimeter wave spectrum is
currently used to provide, or increase capacity for, mobile and fixed wireless services in areas of
high demand. We utilize DSS technology to allow 5G service to run simultaneously with 4G LTE on
multiple spectrum bands. With DSS, whenever customers move outside Verizon’s millimeter wave and
C-Band coverage areas, their 5G-enabled devices will remain on 5G technology using the lower spectrum
bands where this network is available.
We anticipate that demand for spectrum will continue to increase over time, driven by growth in
customer connections and the increased usage of wireless broadband services that use more bandwidth
and require faster rates of speed, as well as the wider deployment of 5G mobile and fixed services.
We expect to meet the demand for 4G and 5G spectrum needs with our existing spectrum assets. If
demand continues to increase or if new spectrum is required for a future generation of technology, we
can meet that demand by acquiring licenses or leasing spectrum from other licensees, or by acquiring
new spectrum licenses from the FCC, if and when future FCC spectrum auctions occur.
From time to time we have exchanged spectrum licenses with other wireless service providers through
secondary market swap transactions. We expect to continue to pursue similar opportunities to trade
spectrum licenses in order to meet capacity and expansion needs in the future. We also gain access to
spectrum through cross-lease transactions. In certain cases, we have entered into intra-market
spectrum swaps designed to increase the amount of contiguous spectrum within frequency bands in a
specific market. Contiguous spectrum improves network performance and efficiency. These swaps, as
well as any spectrum purchases, require us to obtain governmental approvals.
Information regarding spectrum license transactions is included in Note 3 to the consolidated
financial statements included in this Annual Report.
 Competition and Related Trends 
The telecommunications industry is highly competitive. The rapid development of new technologies,
services and products has eliminated many of the distinctions among wireless, cable, internet and
traditional telephone services and brought new competitors to our markets. We expect competition to
remain intense as traditional and non-traditional participants seek increased market share.
Competitive factors within the telecommunications industry include, among others, network
reliability, speed, capacity and coverage; pricing; the quality of customer service; marketing, sales
and distribution capabilities; development of new and enhanced products and services; ability to
anticipate and respond to various factors and trends affecting our industry; the availability of
capital resources; and regulatory changes.

Table of Contents
Competition remains intense as a result of various factors, including aggressive pricing, increased
levels of promotions and service plan discounts, and offerings that include additional bundled
premium content, in some cases specifically targeting Verizon customers. Competition may increase as
smaller, stand-alone wireless service providers merge or transfer licenses to larger, better
capitalized wireless service providers and as MVNOs resell wireless communication services. In
addition, increasing government incentives related to network deployment may enhance the ability of
certain of our competitors to compete with us.
With respect to our wireless connectivity products and services, we compete against other national
wireless service providers, including AT&T Inc. and T-Mobile US, Inc., as well as various regional
wireless service providers. We also compete for retail activations with resellers that buy bulk
wholesale service from wireless service providers, including Verizon, and resell it to their
customers. Resellers include cable companies, such as Comcast Corporation and Charter Communications,
Inc., and others.
We also face competition from other communications and technology companies seeking to increase their
brand recognition and capture market share with respect to the provision of wireless products and
services, in addition to non-traditional offerings in mobile data. For example, Microsoft
Corporation, Alphabet Inc., Apple Inc., Meta Platforms, Inc. and others are offering alternative
means for messaging and making wireless voice calls that, in certain cases, can be used in lieu of
the wireless providers' voice service, as well as alternative means of accessing video content. In
addition, we expect to see increasing competition in the provisioning of internet access by low Earth
orbit satellite companies as well in the area of fixed wireless offerings that provide an alternative
to traditional landline internet service providers.
With respect to Fios and our other wireline connectivity services, we compete against cable
companies, wireless service providers, domestic and foreign telecommunications providers, satellite
television companies, internet service providers, OTT providers and other companies that offer
network services and managed enterprise solutions. We also face increasing competition from other
internet portal providers. We expect the market will continue to shift from traditional linear video
to OTT offerings. We also expect customer migration from traditional voice services to wireless
services to continue as a growing number of customers place greater value on mobility and wireless
companies position their services as a landline alternative.
Companies with a global presence are increasingly competing with us in our Business segment. A
relatively small number of telecommunications and integrated service providers with global operations
serve customers in the global enterprise market and, to a lesser extent, the global wholesale market.
We compete with these providers for large contracts to provide integrated solutions to global
enterprises and government customers. Many of these companies have strong market presence, brand
recognition and existing customer relationships, all of which contribute to intensifying competition
that may affect our future revenue growth.
In the Enterprise and Public Sector markets, competition levels remain high, primarily as a result of
increased industry focus on technology convergence. We compete in this area with system integrators,
carriers, and hardware and software providers. In addition, some of the largest information
technology services companies are making strategic acquisitions, divesting non-strategic assets and
forging new alliances to improve their cost structure. Many new alliances and acquisitions have
focused on emerging fields, such as cloud computing, software defined networking, communication
applications and other computing tasks via networks, rather than by the use of in-house machines.
In the Business Markets and Other category, customer purchasing behaviors and preferences continue to
evolve. Solution speed and simplicity are becoming key differentiators for customers who are seeking
full life-cycle offers that simplify the process of starting, running and growing their businesses.
Several major cable operators also offer bundles with wireless services through strategic
relationships.
Our Wholesale business competes with traditional carriers for metro/mid/long-haul fiber, voice and IP
services. In addition, mobile video and data needs are driving a greater need for wireless backhaul.
Network providers, cable companies and specialty firms are competitors for this business opportunity.
 Regulatory Trends 
 Regulatory Landscape 
Verizon operates in a regulated and highly competitive market, as described above. Some of our
competitors are subject to fewer regulatory constraints than Verizon. For many services offered by
Verizon, the FCC is our primary regulator. The FCC has jurisdiction over interstate
telecommunications services and other matters under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended
(Communications Act). Other Verizon services are subject to state and local regulation.
 Federal, State and Local Regulation 
 Wireless Services 
The FCC regulates several aspects of our wireless operations. Generally, the FCC has jurisdiction
over the construction, operation, acquisition and transfer of wireless communications systems. All
wireless services require use of radio frequency spectrum, the assignment and distribution of which
is subject to FCC oversight. If demand continues to increase or if new
 9 
Table of Contents
spectrum is required for a future generation of technology, we can meet our needs for licensed
spectrum by purchasing licenses or leasing spectrum from others, or by participating in a competitive
bidding process to acquire new spectrum from the FCC. Those processes are subject to certain reviews,
approvals and potential conditions.
Today, Verizon holds FCC spectrum licenses that allow it to provide a wide range of mobile and fixed
communications services, including both voice and data services. FCC spectrum licenses typically have
a term of 10 years, at which time they are subject to renewal. While the FCC has routinely renewed
all of Verizon’s wireless licenses, challenges could be raised in the future. If a wireless license
was revoked or not renewed, Verizon would not be permitted to provide services on the spectrum
covered by that license. Some of our licenses require us to comply with so-called "open access" FCC
regulations, which generally require licensees of particular spectrum to allow customers to use
devices and applications of their choice, subject to certain technical limitations. The FCC has also
imposed certain specific mandates on wireless carriers, including construction and geographic
coverage requirements, technical operating standards, provision of enhanced 911 services, roaming
obligations and requirements for wireless tower and antenna facilities.
The Communications Act generally preempts regulation by state and local governments of the entry of,
or the rates charged by, wireless carriers. It does not prohibit states from regulating the other
"terms and conditions" of wireless service. For example, some states impose reporting and consumer
protection requirements. Several states also have laws or regulations that address safety issues (for
example, use of wireless handsets while driving), universal service funding, and taxation matters.
Some states are also considering new network reliability or service quality requirements that may
affect how and where we provide services if not preempted by federal law. In addition, wireless tower
and antenna facilities are often subject to state and local zoning and land use regulation, and
securing approvals for new or modified facilities is often a lengthy and expensive process.
 Broadband 
Verizon offers many different broadband services. In 2023, the FCC proposed to return to regulation
of broadband services under Title II of the Communications Act. The proposal would revive and expand
the FCC's 2015 approach (that was reversed in 2017) to regulating broadband internet access services
as telecommunications services subject to utilities-style common carriage regulation. Several states
have also adopted or are considering adopting laws or executive orders that would impose net
neutrality and other requirements on some of our broadband services. The FCC also adopted broad rules
related to "digital discrimination" that could further increase regulatory oversight of broadband
services. Regardless of regulation, Verizon remains committed to the open internet, which provides
consumers with competitive choices and unblocked access to lawful websites and content. Our broadband
commitment can be found on our website at https://www.verizon.com/about/our-company/verizon-
broadband-commitment.
 Wireline Voice 
Verizon offers many different wireline voice services, including traditional telephone service and
other services that rely on technologies such as VoIP. For regulatory purposes, legacy telephone
services are generally considered to be "common carrier" services. Common carrier services are
subject to heightened regulatory oversight with respect to rates, terms and conditions and other
aspects of the services. The FCC has not decided the regulatory classification of VoIP but has said
VoIP service providers must comply with certain rules, such as 911 capabilities and law enforcement
assistance requirements.
State public utility commissions regulate Verizon’s telephone operations with respect to certain
telecommunications intrastate matters. Verizon operates as an "incumbent local exchange carrier" in
nine states and the District of Columbia. These incumbent operations are subject to various levels of
pricing flexibility and other state oversight and requirements. Verizon also has other wireline
operations that are more lightly regulated. Some states, including California, impose reporting
requirements and are considering new network reliability or service quality requirements for wireline
voice services, including for VoIP.
 Video 
Verizon offers a multichannel video service that is regulated like traditional cable service. The FCC
has a body of rules that apply to cable operators, and these rules also generally apply to Verizon.
In areas where Verizon offers its facilities-based multichannel video services, Verizon has been
required to obtain a cable franchise from local government entities, or in some cases a state-wide
franchise, and comply with certain one-time and ongoing obligations as a result.
Privacy, Data Protection, and Artificial Intelligence
We are subject to local, state, federal, and international laws and regulations relating to privacy
and data protection that impact all parts of our business, including wireline, wireless, broadband
and the development and roll out of new products, such as those in the IoT space. At the federal
level, our business is governed by the FCC or the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), depending on the
product or service. The California Consumer Privacy Act, Europe's General Data Protection Regulation
and a number of other privacy laws more recently adopted by other states and countries include
significant penalties for non-compliance. Generally, attention to privacy and data security
requirements is increasing at all levels of government globally, and privacy-related legislation has
been introduced or is under consideration in many locations. These regulations could have a
significant impact on our businesses. Policymakers at the local, state, federal and international
levels are also considering imposing laws and regulations on the use of artificial intelligence. This
is a nascent area of regulatory focus, so it is unclear how such regulation could impact our
business.

Table of Contents
 Public Safety and Cybersecurity 
The FCC plays a role in addressing public safety concerns by regulating emergency communications
services and mandating widespread availability of both media (broadcast/cable) and wireless emergency
alerting services. In addition, federal and state agencies have mandated and may impose additional
regulations to ensure continuity of service during disasters. For example, the FCC adopted rules
requiring wireless providers to support roaming on each other’s networks during disasters, and the
California Public Utilities Commission has imposed regulations relating to back-up power for
communications facilities. In response to prior cyber attacks and increasing risks from cybersecurity
threats, the FCC and other regulators are attempting to increase regulation of the cybersecurity
practices of providers. The FCC is also addressing the use by American companies of equipment
produced by certain companies deemed to cause potential national security risks. Verizon does not
currently use equipment in its networks from vendors under such restrictions.
 Intercarrier Compensation and Network Access 
The FCC regulates some of the rates that carriers pay each other for the exchange of voice traffic
(particularly traditional wireline traffic) over different networks and other aspects of
interconnection for some voice services. The FCC also regulates some of the rates and terms and
conditions for certain wireline "business data services" and other services and network facilities.
Verizon is both a seller and a buyer of these services, and both makes and receives interconnection
payments.
 Human Capital Resources 
With approximately 105,400 employees on a full-time equivalent basis as of December 31, 2023, 89% of
whom are based in the U.S., we know that our people are one of our most valuable assets. In order to
realize our core business strategy, we have developed human capital programs and practices that
support, develop and care for our employees throughout their careers with Verizon. Our strategy to
build a workforce with talent, skills and motivation to give the company a competitive edge now and
into the future rests on three pillars:
• Attract and maintain a diverse workforce with the necessary skills and talent to execute on our
business priorities.
• Develop our employees' potential by offering educational opportunities that keep pace with changes
occurring across our industry.
• Inspire individuals to build a career at Verizon by providing meaningful work and opportunities for
career advancement in a collaborative and inclusive environment.
Verizon strives to be an employer of choice by offering our employees competitive compensation and
benefits packages. We seek to recruit and retain employees with diverse backgrounds, experiences and
perspectives to best meet the needs of the diverse customers and communities we serve. We provide
extensive on-the-job training opportunities, tuition reimbursement programs and career development
support to enable our employees to maximize their potential and thrive professionally. Our long-
standing commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion has resulted in a strong representation of
women and people of color. As of December 31, 2023, Verizon's global workforce was approximately
68.0% male, 31.7% female and 0.3% unknown or undeclared, and the race/ethnicity of our U.S. workforce
was 53.4% White, 18.5% Black, 13.2% Hispanic, 8.7% Asian, 0.4% American Indian/Alaskan Native, 0.3%
Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, 2.5% two or more races, and 3.0% unknown or undeclared. Women
represented 36.9% of U.S. senior leadership (vice president level and above). People of color
represented 32.1% of U.S. senior leadership.
Verizon respects our employees’ rights to freedom of association and collective bargaining in
compliance with applicable law, including the right to join or not join labor unions. We have a long
history of working with the Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers — the two unions that in total represent approximately 24.0% of our employees as
of December 31, 2023. The current collective bargaining agreements covering our union-represented
employees who serve customers in our Mid-Atlantic and Northeast service areas extend through August
1, 2026. In addition, where applicable outside of the U.S., we engage with employee representative
bodies such as works council. Verizon meets with U.S. national and local union leaders, as well as
works council leaders outside the U.S., to talk about key business topics, including safety, customer
service, plans to improve operational processes, our business performance and the impacts that
changing technology and competition are having on our customers, employees and business strategy.
For a discussion of Verizon's Board oversight of our human capital management practices, see the
section entitled "Governance — Our governance framework — Oversight of human capital management" in
our definitive Proxy Statement to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and delivered
to shareholders in connection with our 2024 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.
 Patents, Trademarks and Licenses 
We own or have licenses to various patents, copyrights, trademarks, domain names and other
intellectual property rights necessary to conduct our business. We actively pursue the filing and
registration of patents, copyrights, trademarks and domain names to protect our intellectual property
rights within the United States and abroad. We also actively grant licenses, in
 11 
Table of Contents
exchange for appropriate fees or other consideration and subject to appropriate safeguards and
restrictions, to other companies that enable them to utilize certain of our intellectual property
rights and proprietary technology as part of their products and services. Such licenses enable the
licensees to take advantage of Verizon's brands and the results of Verizon’s research and development
efforts. While these licenses result in valuable consideration for Verizon, we do not believe that
the loss of such consideration, or the expiration of any of our intellectual property rights, would
have a material effect on our results of operations.
We periodically receive offers from third parties to purchase or obtain licenses for patents and
other intellectual property rights in exchange for royalties or other payments. We also periodically
receive notices alleging that our products or services infringe on third-party patents or other
intellectual property rights. These claims, whether against us directly or against third-party
suppliers of products or services that we sell to our customers, if successful, could require us to
pay damages or royalties, rebrand, or cease offering the relevant products or services.

 Item 1A.    Risk Factors 
The following discussion of "Risk Factors" identifies factors that may adversely affect our business,
operations, financial condition or future performance. This information should be read in conjunction
with "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Result of Operations" and the
consolidated financial statements and related notes. The following discussion of risks is not all-
inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are the material factors to consider when
evaluating our business and expectations. These factors could cause our future results to differ
materially from our historical results and from expectations reflected in forward-looking statements.
 Economic and Strategic Risks 
We face significant competition that may reduce our profits.
We face significant competition in our industries. The rapid development of new technologies,
services and products has eliminated many of the traditional distinctions among wireless, cable,
internet and local and long distance communication services and brought new competitors to our
markets, including other telecommunications companies, cable companies, wireless service providers,
satellite providers, technology companies and application and device providers. While these changes
have enabled us to offer new types of products and services, they have also allowed other providers
to broaden the scope of their own competitive offerings. If we are unable to compete effectively, we
could experience lower than expected revenues and earnings.
Wireless service providers are significantly altering the financial relationships with their
customers through commercial offers that vary service and device pricing, promotions, incentives and
levels of service provided – in some cases specifically targeting our customers and putting pressure
on pricing and margins. In addition, we expect the wireless industry’s customer growth rate to
moderate over time in comparison to historical growth rates, leading to increased competition for
customers. Our ability to compete effectively will depend on, among other things, our network
reliability, speed, capacity and coverage, the pricing of our products and services, the quality of
our customer service, our development of new and enhanced products and services, the reach and
quality of our sales and distribution channels, our ability to market our products and services
effectively and our capital resources. It will also depend on how successfully we anticipate and
respond to various factors affecting our industries, including regulatory changes, new technologies
and business models, such as the increasing use of artificial intelligence and machine learning
technologies, changes in consumer preferences and demand for existing services, demographic trends
and evolving economic conditions, including inflation. If we are not able to respond successfully to
these competitive challenges, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely
impacted. In addition, a sustained decline in a reporting unit's revenues and earnings has resulted
in the past, and may again result in the future, in a significant negative impact on its fair value
requiring us to record an impairment charge, which could have an adverse impact on our results of
operations.
 13 
Table of Contents
If we are not able to take advantage of developments in technology and address changing consumer
demand on a timely basis, or if the deployment of our 5G network is delayed or hindered for any
reason, we may experience a decline in the demand for our services, be unable to implement our
business strategy and experience reduced profits.
Our industries are rapidly changing as new technologies are developed that offer consumers an array
of choices for their communications needs and allow new entrants into the markets we serve. In order
to grow and remain competitive, we will need to adapt to future changes in technology, enhance our
existing offerings and introduce new offerings to address our customers’ changing demands. If we are
unable to meet future challenges from competing technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable
cost, we could lose customers to our competitors. We may not be able to accurately predict
technological trends or the success of new services in the market. If our new services fail to gain
acceptance in the marketplace, or if costs associated with the implementation and introduction of
these services materially increase, our ability to retain and attract customers could be adversely
affected.
The deployment of our 5G network is subject to a variety of risks, including those related to
equipment availability, unexpected costs, and regulatory matters that could cause deployment delays
or network performance issues. In addition, certain use cases for 5G technologies and related
ecosystems are still in early development stages and their ultimate adoption or success is uncertain.
These issues could result in significant costs, put us at a competitive disadvantage, or reduce the
anticipated benefits of the enhancements to our networks.
As we introduce new offerings and technologies, we expect to phase out outdated and unprofitable
technologies and services. If we are unable to do so on a cost-effective basis, we could experience
reduced profits. In addition, there could be legal or regulatory restraints on our ability to phase
out current services.
Adverse conditions in the U.S. and international economies could impact our results of operations and
financial condition.
Unfavorable economic conditions, such as a recession or economic slowdown in the U.S. or elsewhere,
or inflation in the markets in which we operate, could negatively affect the affordability of and
demand for some of our products and services and our cost of doing business. In difficult economic
conditions, consumers may seek to reduce discretionary spending by forgoing purchases of our
products, electing to use fewer higher margin services, dropping down in price plans or obtaining
lower-cost products and services offered by other companies. Similarly, under these conditions, the
business customers that we serve may delay purchasing decisions, delay full implementation of service
offerings or reduce their use of services. In addition, adverse economic conditions may lead to an
increased number of our consumer and business customers that are unable to pay for services.
Unfavorable economic conditions could also amplify other risk factors discussed in this section,
including, but not limited to, our competitive position and margins. Over the last two years, as a
result of the inflationary environment in the U.S., we experienced increases in our direct costs,
including electricity and other energy-related costs for our network operations, and transportation
and labor costs, as well as increased interest expenses related to rising interest rates. In 2022,
these factors, along with impacts of the intense competition in our industries, resulted in lower
earnings per share and caused us to lower our growth expectations and related financial guidance for
that year. We expect the inflationary environment and related pressures to continue into 2024. In
that case and if other unfavorable economic conditions continue or worsen, they could have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
 Operational Risks 
Cyber attacks impacting our networks or systems could have an adverse effect on our business.
Cyber attacks, including through the use of ransomware and other forms of malware, distributed denial
of services attacks, credential harvesting, social engineering and other means for obtaining
unauthorized access to or disrupting the operation of our networks and systems and those of our
suppliers, vendors and other service providers, could have an adverse effect on our business. Cyber
attacks may cause equipment failures, loss of information, including sensitive personal information
of customers or employees or valuable technical and marketing information, as well as disruptions to
our or our customers’ operations. Cyber attacks against companies, including Verizon, have increased
in frequency, scope and potential harm in recent years. They may occur alone or in conjunction with
physical attacks, especially where disruption of service is an objective of the attacker. The
development and maintenance of systems to prevent such attacks is costly and requires ongoing
monitoring and updating to address their increasing prevalence and sophistication. While, to date, we
have not been subject to cyber attacks that, individually or in the aggregate, have been material to
Verizon's operations or financial condition, the preventive actions we take to reduce the risks
associated with cyber attacks, including protection of our systems and networks, may be insufficient
to repel or mitigate the effects of a cyber attack in the future.
The inability to operate or use our networks and systems or those of our suppliers, vendors and other
service providers as a result of cyber attacks, even for a limited period of time, may result in
significant expenses to Verizon and/or a loss of market share to our competitors. The costs
associated with a cyber attack on Verizon could include expensive incentives offered to existing
customers and business partners to retain their business, increased expenditures on cybersecurity
measures and the use of alternate resources, lost revenues from business interruption and litigation.
Further, certain of Verizon’s businesses, such as those offering security solutions and
infrastructure and cloud services to business customers, could be negatively affected if
 14 
Table of Contents
our ability to protect our own networks and systems is called into question as a result of a cyber
attack. Our presence in the IoT industry, which includes offerings of telematics products and
services, could also increase our exposure to potential costs and expenses and reputational harm in
the event of cyber attacks impacting these products or services. In addition, a compromise of
security or a theft or other compromise of valuable information, such as financial data and sensitive
or private personal information, could result in lawsuits and government claims, investigations or
proceedings. Any of these occurrences could damage our reputation, adversely impact customer and
investor confidence and result in a material adverse effect on Verizon’s results of operation or
financial condition.
Natural disasters, extreme weather conditions, acts of war, terrorist or other hostile acts could
cause damage to our infrastructure and result in significant disruptions to our operations.
Our business operations are subject to interruption by power outages, acts of war, terrorist or other
hostile acts, natural disasters or the potential impacts of climate change, including the increasing
prevalence and intensity of hurricanes, wildfires, flooding, hail and storms. Such events could cause
significant damage to our infrastructure upon which our business operations rely, resulting in
degradation or disruption of service to our customers, as well as significant recovery time and
expenditures to resume operations. Our system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate to sustain
our operations through all such events. We are implementing, and will continue to implement, measures
to protect our infrastructure and operations from the impacts of these events in the future, but
these measures and our overall disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all
eventualities. These events could also damage the infrastructure of the suppliers that provide us
with the equipment and services that we need to operate our business and provide products to our
customers. These occurrences could result in lost revenues from business interruption, damage to our
reputation and reduced profits.
We depend on key suppliers and vendors to provide services and equipment that we need to operate our
business.
We depend on various key suppliers and vendors to provide us, directly or through other suppliers,
with equipment and services, such as fiber, switch and network equipment, smartphones and other
wireless devices, customer service support and other services that we need in order to operate our
business. For example, our smartphone and other device suppliers often rely on one vendor for the
manufacture and supply of critical components, such as chipsets, used in their devices, and there are
a limited number of companies capable of supplying the network infrastructure equipment on which we
depend.
Our suppliers or vendors could fail to provide equipment or service on a timely basis, or fail to
meet our performance expectations, for a number of reasons, including, for example, disruption to the
global supply chain as a result of geopolitical factors, public health crises, natural disasters or
the potential impacts of global climate change. If such failures occur, we may be unable to provide
products and services as and when requested by our customers, or we may be unable to continue to
maintain or upgrade our networks. Due to the cost and time lag that can be associated with
transitioning from one supplier to another, our business could be substantially disrupted if we were
required to, or chose to, replace the products or services of one or more major suppliers with
products or services from another source, especially if the replacement became necessary on short
notice. Any such disruption could increase our costs, decrease our operating efficiencies and have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
A significant number of our suppliers and vendors are located or rely on operations outside of the
U.S., which carries additional risks and regulatory obligations, including those related to
cybersecurity, data privacy and compliance. Certain business practices in foreign countries may not
align with U.S. laws and regulations. In addition, international operations increase our exposure to
other risks, such as economic and geopolitical instability, fluctuations in exchange rates, and
labor-related risks.
The suppliers and vendors on which we rely are and may in the future be subject to litigation with
respect to technology on which we depend, including litigation involving claims of patent
infringement. Such claims are frequently made in the communications industry. We are unable to
predict whether our business will be affected by any such litigation. We expect our dependence on key
suppliers to continue as we develop and introduce more advanced generations of technology.
A significant portion of our workforce is represented by labor unions, and we could incur additional
costs or experience work stoppages as a result of the renegotiation of our labor contracts.
As of December 31, 2023, approximately 24.0% of our workforce is represented by the Communications
Workers of America or the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. While we have labor
contracts in place with these unions, with subsequent negotiations we could incur additional costs
and/or experience work stoppages, which could adversely affect our business operations. In addition,
while a small percentage of the workforce outside of our traditional wireline operations is
represented by unions for bargaining, we cannot predict what impact increased union density in this
workforce could have on our operations.
Damage to our reputation or brands could adversely affect our business.
We believe that our reputation and brands significantly contribute to the success of our business and
our relationships with our customers, employees and other stakeholders.
Our reputation and brands could be negatively affected by a number of factors, including actual or
alleged quality or reliability issues related to our services and products; cybersecurity incidents
and data breaches; allegations of legal noncompliance;
 15 
Table of Contents
litigation or regulatory activity; incidents involving unethical behavior or misconduct; material
weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting; safety, human rights, workplace or
labor issues; environmental incidents or impacts; governance issues; our sustainability goals and
practices; our actual or perceived position or lack of position on social and other sensitive
matters; the conduct of our employees, representatives or partners; activists’ campaigns; negative
sentiment about us shared over social media or the press; and other issues, incidents, or statements
that, whether based on actual or perceived circumstances, result in adverse publicity.
Damage to our reputation and brands could undermine our customers’ confidence in us and reduce demand
for our products and services, which could result in decreased revenue and adversely affect our
business and financial results. If our reputation or brands are damaged, it could also attract
regulatory scrutiny, increase litigation risks, affect our ability to attract and retain top talent,
and reduce investor confidence in us.
Public health crises could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results
of operations.
We are subject to risks related to public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which had an
adverse effect on our operating results in 2020. Our business is based on our ability to provide
products and services to customers throughout the United States and around the world and the ability
of those customers to use and pay for those products and services for their businesses and in their
daily lives. As a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be
materially adversely affected by a public health crisis that significantly impacts the way customers
use and are able to pay for our products and services, the way our employees are able to provide
services to our customers, and the ways that our partners and suppliers are able to provide products
and services to us. For example, public and private sector policies and initiatives to reduce the
transmission of COVID-19 and initiatives Verizon took in response to the health crisis to promote the
health and safety of our employees and provide critical infrastructure and connectivity to our
customers, along with the related global slowdown in economic activity, resulted in decreased
revenues, increased costs and lower earnings per share during 2020. In addition, such a crisis could
significantly increase the probability or consequences of the risks our business faces in ordinary
circumstances, such as risks associated with our supplier and vendor relationships, risks of an
economic slowdown, regulatory risks, and the costs and availability of financing.
 Regulatory and Legal Risks 
Changes in the regulatory framework under which we operate could adversely affect our business
prospects or results of operations.
Our domestic operations are subject to regulation by the FCC and other federal, state, and local
agencies, and our international operations are regulated by various foreign governments and
international bodies. These regulatory regimes frequently restrict or impose conditions on our
ability to operate in designated areas and provide specified products or services. We are frequently
required to maintain licenses for our operations and conduct our operations in accordance with
prescribed standards. We are often involved in regulatory and other governmental proceedings or
inquiries related to the application of these requirements. It is impossible to predict with any
certainty the outcome of pending federal and state regulatory proceedings relating to our operations,
or the reviews by federal or state courts of regulatory rulings. Without relief, existing laws and
regulations may inhibit our ability to expand our business and introduce new products and services.
Similarly, we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in obtaining the licenses needed to carry
out our business plan or in maintaining our existing licenses. For example, the FCC grants wireless
licenses for terms generally lasting 10 years, subject to renewal. The loss of, or a material
limitation on, certain of our licenses could have a material adverse effect on our business, results
of operations and financial condition.
New laws or regulations or changes to the existing regulatory framework at the federal, state, and
local, or international level, such as those described below, those that incentivize business models
or technologies different from ours or requirements limiting our ability to continue or discontinue
service to customers could restrict the ways in which we manage our wireline and wireless networks
and operate our businesses, impose additional costs, diminish revenue opportunities, and potentially
impede our ability to provide services in a manner that would be attractive to us and our customers.
• Privacy and data protection – We are subject to local, state, federal and international laws and
regulations related to privacy and data protection. In particular, the California Consumer Privacy
Act, Europe's General Data Protection Regulation and a number of other privacy laws more recently
adopted by other states and countries include significant penalties for non-compliance. Generally,
attention to privacy and data security requirements is increasing at all levels of government
globally, and privacy-related legislation has been introduced or is under consideration in many
locations. These regulations could have a significant impact on our businesses.
• Regulation of broadband internet access services – In 2023, the FCC proposed to return to
regulation of broadband services under Title II of the Communications Act. The proposal would revive
and expand the FCC's 2015 approach (that was reversed in 2017) to regulating broadband internet
access services as telecommunications services subject to utilities-style common carriage regulation.
Several states have also adopted or are considering adopting laws or executive orders that would
impose net neutrality and other requirements on some of our broadband services. The FCC also adopted
broad rules related to "digital discrimination" that could further increase regulatory oversight of
broadband services.
 16 
Table of Contents
• "Open Access" – We hold certain wireless licenses that require us to comply with so-called "open
access" FCC regulations, which generally require licensees of particular spectrum to allow customers
to use devices and applications of their choice. Moreover, certain services could be subject to
conflicting regulation by the FCC and/or various state and local authorities, which could
significantly increase the cost of implementing and introducing new services.
• Climate-Related Regulation and Policy – Due to the nature of our operations, we have been, and
expect to continue to be impacted by regulatory developments related to climate change, including,
for example, the direct regulation of greenhouse gas emissions or carbon policies that could result
in a tax on such emissions. In addition, policy-driven changes in the prices of fuel or energy in
geographies in which we operate could make it more expensive for us to purchase energy to power our
networks and data centers, and any increase in taxes on fuel could increase our costs associated with
operating those vehicles in our fleet that are dependent on traditional fuels.
These developments and the further regulation of broadband, wireless, and our other activities and
any related court decisions could result in significant increases in costs for us or restrict our
ability to compete in the marketplace and limit the return we can expect to achieve on past and
future investments in our networks.
Our business may be impacted by changes in tax laws and regulations, or their interpretations, and
challenges to our tax positions.
Tax laws and regulations are complex, dynamic, and subject to change and varying interpretations,
especially when evaluated against new technologies and telecommunications services. In addition, tax
legislation has been introduced or is being considered in various jurisdictions that could
significantly impact our tax rate, tax liabilities, and carrying value of deferred tax assets or
deferred tax liabilities. Any of these changes could materially impact our financial performance and
our tax provision, net income and cash flows.
We are also subject to ongoing audits, examinations and other tax controversies in various
jurisdictions. Although we regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these
controversies to determine the adequacy of provisions for taxes, the final outcome of any such
controversy may be materially different from our expectations. In the event that we have not
accurately or fully described, disclosed or determined, calculated or remitted amounts that were due
to taxing authorities or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess
of amounts previously accrued, we could be subject to additional taxes, penalties and interest, which
could materially impact our business, financial condition and operating results.
We are subject to a substantial amount of litigation, which could require us to pay significant
damages or settlements.
We are subject to a substantial amount of litigation and claims in arbitration, including, but not
limited to, shareholder lawsuits, patent and copyright infringement lawsuits, wage and hour class
actions, contract and commercial claims, personal injury claims, property claims, environmental
claims, and lawsuits relating to our advertising, sales, billing and collection practices. In
addition, our wireless business also faces personal injury and wrongful death lawsuits relating to
alleged health effects of wireless phones or radio frequency transmitters. We may incur significant
expenses in defending these lawsuits. In addition, we may be required to pay significant awards or
settlements.
Allegations related to lead sheathed copper cables in our copper network infrastructure could expose
us to regulatory scrutiny, litigation, penalties, removal and compliance costs, operational impact or
reputational damage.
There have been media reports alleging that certain lead sheathed copper cables that are part of our
copper-based network infrastructure may present health or environmental risks in areas where those
facilities are deployed. These allegations could result in government investigations, legislative or
regulatory actions, litigation, penalties and other liability, remediation and compliance costs or
negative operational impacts. In addition, we are currently subject to regulatory inquiries and
lawsuits related to these allegations, and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies may
arise in the future. Our insurance policies may not cover or may not be sufficient to fully cover the
costs of these claims. Accordingly, we may incur substantial expenses as a result of these
allegations, which cannot be reasonably estimated at this time but could be material.
In addition, negative assertions about the health or environmental impact of our lead sheathed cables
may harm our reputation, which could adversely affect our business and our relationship with various
stakeholders, even if such allegations ultimately prove to be inaccurate.
 Financial Risks 
Verizon has significant debt, which could increase further if Verizon incurs additional debt in the
future and does not retire existing debt.
As of December 31, 2023, Verizon had approximately $128.5 billion of outstanding unsecured
indebtedness, $9.5 billion of unused borrowing capacity under our existing revolving credit facility
and $22.2 billion of outstanding secured indebtedness. Verizon’s debt level and related debt service
obligations could have negative consequences, including:
 17 
Table of Contents
• requiring Verizon to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal,
interest and other amounts payable on our debt, which would reduce the funds we have available for
other purposes, such as working capital, capital expenditures, dividend payments and acquisitions;
• making it more difficult or expensive for Verizon to obtain any necessary future financing for
working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, debt refinancing, acquisitions or
other purposes and limiting its ability to repurchase common stock;
• reducing Verizon’s flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our industries and market
conditions;
• making Verizon more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business; and
• exposing Verizon to increased interest rate risk to the extent that (i) our debt obligations are
subject to variable interest rates or (ii) we need to refinance existing debt that bears interest at
a rate lower than current market rates.
Adverse changes in the financial markets and other factors could increase our borrowing costs and the
availability of financing.
We require a significant amount of capital to operate and grow our business. We fund our capital
needs in part through borrowings in the public and private credit markets. Adverse changes in the
financial markets, including increases in interest rates or changes in exchange rates, could increase
our cost of borrowing, require us to post a significant amount of collateral, and/or make it more
difficult for us to obtain financing for our operations or refinance existing indebtedness. In
addition, our ability to obtain funding under asset-backed debt transactions is subject to our
ability to continue to originate a sufficient amount of assets eligible to be securitized. Our
borrowing costs also can be affected by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent
rating agencies, which are based, in significant part, on our performance as measured by customary
credit metrics. A decrease in these ratings would likely increase our cost of borrowing and/or make
it more difficult for us to obtain financing. A severe disruption in the global financial markets
could impact some of the financial institutions with which we do business, and such instability could
also affect our access to financing.
Increases in costs for pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits may reduce our
profitability and increase our funding commitments.
With approximately 105,400 employees and approximately 182,700 retirees as of December 31, 2023
eligible to participate in Verizon’s benefit plans, the costs of pension benefits and active and
retiree healthcare benefits have a significant impact on our profitability. Our costs of maintaining
these plans, and the future funding requirements for these plans, are affected by several factors,
including increases in healthcare costs, decreases in investment returns on funds held by our pension
and other benefit plan trusts and changes in the discount rate and mortality assumptions used to
calculate pension and other postretirement expenses. If we are unable to limit future increases in
the costs of our benefit plans, those costs could reduce our profitability and increase our funding
commitments.
 Item 1B.    Unresolved Staff Comments 
None.
 Item 1C.    Cybersecurity 
 Cybersecurity Program 
Verizon’s comprehensive cybersecurity program is designed to identify and protect against
cybersecurity risks and to position Verizon to rapidly detect, respond to, and recover from
cybersecurity incidents that impact our company. The program is built on the following pillars:
• NIST Cybersecurity Framework. Our program is aligned to the National Institute of Standards and
Technology’s (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework, which outlines the core components and responsibilities
necessary to sustain a healthy and well-balanced cybersecurity program.
• Risk identification. We continually assess the cybersecurity threat and vulnerability landscape
using various commercial, government and publicly available information sources.
• Risk detection. We use both manual and automated detection methods on a scheduled and ad-hoc basis
to identify vulnerabilities within, and threats to, our operations and network infrastructure.
• Risk evaluation. Once a cybersecurity vulnerability is detected, we assign a threat severity
classification based on the risk profile associated with the vulnerability.
 18 
Table of Contents
• Remediation. Verizon’s information security team reports all cybersecurity vulnerabilities and
their associated threat classification to the appropriate business team for remediation. Deadlines
for remediation are set based on the severity of the threat and closely tracked in a central system
of record. In the instances when a remediation deadline cannot be met, the information security team
and the business team work together to deploy appropriate mitigating or compensating controls until
the remediation work is complete.
• Metrics and analysis. We track the performance of our cybersecurity program by collecting,
retaining and analyzing a broad range of data related to our threat identification, detection and
response activity. We use this data to assess threat trends, for strategic planning purposes and to
enhance management accountability for cybersecurity.
Verizon has a comprehensive enterprise cybersecurity incident response plan, which is activated in
the event of a cybersecurity incident. The plan is a detailed playbook that specifies how Verizon
classifies, responds to, and recovers from cybersecurity incidents and includes notification
procedures that vary depending on the significance of the incident. When warranted by the severity of
the incident, our Chief Executive Officer and other senior executives are part of the notification
chain.
Verizon validates enterprise cybersecurity maturity every two years through a third-party maturity
assessment. This assessment measures Verizon’s ability to identify, prevent, detect, respond to, and
recover from threats to systems, assets and data. The results of the assessment serve as the baseline
for enterprise cybersecurity across the company. In addition to this baseline, certain subsets of our
technology environment are subject to incremental cybersecurity certification and periodic third
party validation under applicable regulatory or contractual requirements.
 Integrated Cybersecurity Risk Management 
Verizon’s Senior Vice President and Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) has responsibility for
the management of cybersecurity risks at Verizon. The CISO and their team are responsible for
Verizon’s information security strategy, policy, standards, architecture and processes.
The CISO brings nearly two decades of cybersecurity experience to their work at Verizon. Prior to
joining Verizon, they held executive-level cybersecurity roles at other large public companies, where
they were responsible for cybersecurity strategy and operations, including incident response, threat
intelligence, security services, architecture, commercial operational technology security, and
regulatory and compliance matters.
Verizon effectuates cybersecurity management by providing for close cooperation among the CISO’s team
and other teams within the company, as well as by integrating cybersecurity risk into Verizon’s
overall enterprise risk management structures and processes. Each of our business units and certain
functional groups have a Business Information Security Officer, who is an integral member of that
unit or group, but reports to the CISO. This structure provides the CISO with line of sight across
the enterprise. The CISO and members of their leadership team also meet regularly with business unit
senior leaders, including the CEO, the Chief Financial Officer and the Chief Human Resources Officer,
to discuss business priorities, emerging threats and trends, and the performance of the cybersecurity
program.
The Verizon Executive Security Council (VESC) oversees and evaluates the work of the CISO and their
team. The VESC is jointly chaired by the presidents of Verizon Global Services and Global Networks
and Technology and includes Verizon’s Chief Compliance Officer, Chief Legal Officer, Senior Vice
President of Internal Audit and senior executives in business and technology functions. The VESC
provides oversight of all aspects of Verizon’s cybersecurity program and, at regular intervals
throughout the year, evaluates key cybersecurity metrics as well as planned and ongoing initiatives
to reduce cybersecurity risks.
Verizon’s Management Audit Committee (VMAC), which includes our Chief Financial Officer, Senior Vice
President of Internal Audit and other senior executives, is responsible for overseeing components of
our overall risk management strategy. The VMAC receives quarterly updates from the CISO on Verizon’s
cybersecurity program.
Verizon also operates a robust internal audit program. Each year, Verizon’s internal audit team
conducts an overall business risk assessment, which includes an evaluation of cybersecurity risks.
The results of the assessment are presented to the leaders of the relevant business teams, who are
responsible for prioritizing and addressing the risks identified.
 Board Oversight of Cybersecurity Risk 
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors (Board) has primary responsibility for overseeing
Verizon’s risk management and compliance programs relating to cybersecurity and data protection and
privacy.
As part of the Board’s oversight of risks from cybersecurity threats, the CISO leads an annual review
and discussion with the full Board dedicated to Verizon’s cybersecurity risks, threats and
protections. The CISO provides a mid-year update to this annual review to the Audit Committee and, as
warranted, additional updates throughout the year. The Audit Committee also receives a report from
senior management on Verizon’s cybersecurity posture and related matters at each of its other
meetings during the year at which the CISO is not present.

 Supplier Risk Management 
We have implemented processes to identify and manage risks from cybersecurity threats associated with
our use of third-party service providers. The Verizon Supplier Risk Management Program establishes
governance, processes and tools for managing various supplier-related risks, including information
security. As a condition of working with Verizon, suppliers who access sensitive business or customer
information are expected to meet certain information security requirements.
 Risks from Cybersecurity Threats 
We are subject to increasing and evolving cybersecurity threats as cyber attacks against companies,
including Verizon, have increased in frequency, scope and potential harm in recent years. While, to
date, we have not been subject to cyber attacks that, individually or in the aggregate, have been
material to Verizon's operations or financial condition, there can be no guarantee that we will not
experience such an incident in the future. For more information on the risks from cybersecurity
threats that we face, refer to “Risk Factors — Operational Risks — Cyber attacks impacting our
networks or systems could have an adverse effect on our business” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual
Report on Form 10-K.
 Item 2.    Properties 
Our principal properties do not lend themselves to simple description by character and location. Our
total gross investment in property, plant and equipment was approximately $320 billion at December
31, 2023 and $308 billion at December 31, 2022, including the effect of retirements, but before
deducting accumulated depreciation. Our gross investment in property, plant and equipment consisted
of the following:
 At December 31, 2023 2022 
 ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── 
 Network equipment 77.6 % 77.2 % 
 Land, buildings and building equipment 11.8 % 11.7 % 
 Furniture and other 10.6 % 11.1 % 
 100.0 % 100.0 % 
Network equipment consists primarily of cable (aerial, buried, underground or undersea) and the
related support structures of poles and conduit, wireless plant, switching equipment, network
software, transmission equipment and related facilities. Land, buildings and building equipment
consists of land and land improvements, central office buildings or any other buildings that house
network equipment, and buildings that are used for administrative and other purposes. Substantially
all the switching centers are located on land and in buildings we own due to their critical role in
the networks and high set-up and relocation costs. We also maintain facilities throughout the U.S.
comprised of administrative and sales offices, customer care centers, retail sales locations, garage
work centers, switching centers, cell sites and data centers. Furniture and other consists of
telephone equipment, furniture, data processing equipment, office equipment, motor vehicles,
construction in process, and leasehold improvements.
 Item 3.    Legal Proceedings 
In the ordinary course of business, Verizon is involved in various litigation and regulatory
proceedings at the state and federal level. As of the date of this report, we do not believe that any
pending legal proceedings to which we or our subsidiaries are subject are required to be disclosed as
material legal proceedings pursuant to this item. Verizon is not subject to any administrative or
judicial proceeding arising under any federal, state or local provisions that have been enacted or
adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or primarily for the purpose of
protecting the environment that is likely to result in monetary sanctions of $1 million or more. For
a discussion of our litigation risks, refer to Item 1A Risk Factors.

 PART II 
 Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, 
 Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases 
 of Equity Securities 
The principal market for trading in the common stock of the Company is the New York Stock Exchange
under the symbol "VZ".
As of December 31, 2023, there were 421,493 shareholders of record. In addition, a significant number
of holders of the Company's common stock are "street name" or beneficial holders, whose shares are
held of record by banks, brokers, and other financial institutions.
 Stock Repurchases 
In February 2020, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized a share buyback program to
repurchase up to 100 million shares of our common stock. The program will terminate when the
aggregate number of shares purchased reaches 100 million, or a new share repurchase plan superseding
the current plan is authorized, whichever is sooner. Under the program, shares may be repurchased in
privately negotiated transactions, on the open market, or otherwise, including through plans
complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act. The timing and number of shares purchased under
the program, if any, will depend on market conditions and our capital allocation priorities.
During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, Verizon did not repurchase any shares of the
Company's common stock under our authorized share buyback program. At December 31, 2023, the maximum
number of shares that could be purchased by or on behalf of Verizon under our share buyback program
was 100 million.

 Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of 
 Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 Overview 
Verizon Communications Inc. is a holding company that, acting through its subsidiaries, is one of the
world’s leading providers of communications, technology, information and entertainment products and
services to consumers, businesses and government entities. With a presence around the world, we offer
data, video and voice services and solutions on our networks and platforms that are designed to meet
customers’ demand for mobility, reliable network connectivity and security.
To compete effectively in today’s dynamic marketplace, we are focused on the capabilities of our
high-performing networks to drive growth based on delivering what customers want and need in the
digital world. We are consistently deploying new network architecture and technologies to secure our
leadership in both 4G and 5G wireless networks. Our network quality is the hallmark of our brand and
the foundation for the connectivity, platforms and solutions upon which we build our competitive
advantage. In 2023, we continued deploying our C-Band spectrum, enhancing and driving the
monetization of our networks, platforms and solutions, while focusing on improving our financial and
operating performance.
Our strategy requires significant capital investments primarily to acquire wireless spectrum, put the
spectrum into service, provide additional capacity for growth in our networks, invest in the fiber
that supports our businesses, evolve and maintain our networks and develop and maintain significant
advanced information technology systems and data system capabilities. We believe that our C-Band
spectrum, together with our industry leading millimeter wave spectrum holdings and our 4G LTE network
and fiber infrastructure, will drive innovative products and services and fuel our growth.
 Highlights of Our 2023 Financial Results 
(dollars in millions)
 Business Overview 
We have two reportable segments that we operate and manage as strategic business units - Verizon
Consumer Group (Consumer) and Verizon Business Group (Business).
 22 
Table of Contents
 Revenue by Segment 
———
Note: Excludes eliminations.
 Verizon Consumer Group 
Our Consumer segment provides consumer-focused wireless and wireline communications services and
products. Our wireless services are provided across one of the most extensive wireless networks in
the U.S. under the Verizon family of brands and through wholesale and other arrangements. We also
provide FWA broadband through our 5G or 4G LTE networks as an alternative to traditional landline
internet access. Our wireline services are provided in nine states in the Mid-Atlantic and
Northeastern U.S., as well as Washington D.C., over our 100% fiber-optic network through our Verizon
Fios product portfolio and over a traditional copper-based network to customers who are not served by
Fios. Our Consumer segment's wireless and wireline products and services are available to our retail
customers, as well as resellers that purchase wireless network access from us on a wholesale basis.
Customers can obtain our wireless services on a postpaid or prepaid basis. Our postpaid service is
generally billed one month in advance for a monthly access charge in return for access to and usage
of network services. Our prepaid service is offered only to Consumer customers and enables
individuals to obtain wireless services without credit verification by paying for all services in
advance. The Consumer segment also offers several categories of wireless equipment to customers,
including a variety of smartphones and other handsets, wireless-enabled internet devices, such as
tablets, and other wireless-enabled connected devices, such as smart watches.
In addition to the wireless services and equipment discussed above, the Consumer segment sells
residential fixed connectivity solutions, including internet, video and voice services, and wireless
network access to resellers on a wholesale basis. The Consumer segment's operating revenues for the
year ended December 31, 2023 totaled $101.6 billion, a decrease of $1.9 billion, or 1.8%, compared to
the year ended December 31, 2022. See "Segment Results of Operations" for additional information
regarding our Consumer segment’s operating performance and selected operating statistics.
 Verizon Business Group 
Our Business segment provides wireless and wireline communications services and products, including
FWA broadband, data, video and conferencing services, corporate networking solutions, security and
managed network services, local and long distance voice services and network access to deliver
various IoT services and products, including solutions that support mobile resource management. We
provide these products and services to businesses, government customers and wireless and wireline
carriers across the U.S. and a subset of these products and services to customers around the world.
The Business segment's operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023 totaled $30.1 billion,
a decrease of $950 million, or 3.1%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. See "Segment
Results of Operations" for additional information regarding our Business segment’s operating
performance and selected operating statistics.
 Corporate and Other 
Corporate and other primarily includes device insurance programs, investments in unconsolidated
businesses and development stage businesses that support our strategic initiatives, as well as
unallocated corporate expenses, certain pension and other employee benefit related costs and interest
and financing expenses. Corporate and other also includes the historical results of divested
businesses and other adjustments and gains and losses that are not allocated or used in assessing
segment performance due to their nature. Although such transactions are excluded from the business
segment results, they are included in reported consolidated earnings. Gains and losses from these
transactions that are not individually significant are included in segment results and therefore
included in the chief operating decision maker’s assessment of segment performance. See "Consolidated
Results of Operations" for additional information regarding Corporate and other results.

Table of Contents
 Capital Expenditures and Investments 
We continue to invest in our wireless networks, high-speed fiber and other advanced technologies to
position ourselves at the center of growth trends for the future. During the year ended December 31,
2023, these investments included $18.8 billion for capital expenditures . See "Cash Flows Used in
Investing Activities" and "Liquidity and Capital Resources" for additional information. In the second
quarter of 2023, we completed our accelerated $10 billion capital program related to C-Band spectrum
deployment. Our ongoing C-Band spectrum deployment is funded through our general capital expenditure
program.
 Global Network and Technology 
Over the past several years, we have been leading the development of 5G wireless technology industry
standards and the ecosystems for fixed and mobile 5G wireless services. 5G technology enables higher
throughput and lower latency than 4G LTE technology and allows our networks to handle more traffic as
the number of internet-connected devices grows.
We are focusing our capital investment on building our next generation 5G network, while also adding
capacity and density to our 4G LTE network. We are densifying our networks by utilizing macro and
small cell technology, in-building solutions and distributed antenna systems. Network densification
enables us to add capacity to address increasing mobile video consumption and the growing demand for
IoT products and services on our 5G and 4G LTE networks. In January 2022, we began rapidly deploying
our C-Band spectrum, which, as of December 31, 2023, covers approximately 242 million people in the
U.S. We obtained full access to our C-Band spectrum in August 2023 and will continue deploying this
spectrum across the continental U.S.
To compensate for the shrinking market for traditional copper-based products, we continue to build
fiber-based networks supporting data, video and advanced business services - areas where demand for
reliable high-speed connections is growing. In addition, we leverage our 5G and 4G LTE networks for
our FWA broadband service.
 Consolidated Results of Operations 
In this section, we discuss our overall results of operations and highlight special items that are
not included in our segment results. In "Segment Results of Operations," we review the performance of
our two reportable segments in more detail.
During the first quarter of 2023, Verizon reorganized the customer groups within its Business
segment. Previously, this segment was comprised of four customer groups: Small and Medium Business,
Global Enterprise, Public Sector and Other, and Wholesale. Following the reorganization, there are
now three customer groups: Enterprise and Public Sector, Business Markets and Other, and Wholesale.
Enterprise and Public Sector combines the customers previously included in Global Enterprise and
Public Sector and Other (excluding BlueJeans and Connect customers) as well as the commercial
wireline customers previously included in Small and Medium Business. Business Markets and Other
combines the customers previously included in Small and Medium Business (excluding commercial
wireline customers), the BlueJeans customers previously included in Global Enterprise and Public
Sector and Other, and the Connect customers previously included in Public Sector and Other. The
Wholesale customer group remained unchanged. Prior period operating revenue results within the
Business segment have been recast for these reorganized customer groups. There was no change to the
composition of our reportable segments and total segment results, nor the determination of segment
profit.
A discussion of the Business segment's 2021 operating revenue results reflecting the current customer
groups and year-over-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021 have been included in "Segment Results of
Operations" below. A discussion of the 2021 items and year-over-year comparisons between 2022 and
2021 for all other items that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in the "Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.

Operating expenses for our segments are discussed separately below under the heading "Segment Results
of Operations."
 Cost of Services 
Cost of services includes the following costs directly attributable to a service: salaries and wages,
benefits, materials and supplies, content costs, contracted services, network access and transport
costs, customer provisioning costs, computer systems support and costs to support our outsourcing
contracts and technical facilities. Aggregate customer service costs, which include billing and
service provisioning, are allocated between Cost of services and Selling, general and administrative
expense.
Cost of services decreased during 2023 compared to 2022 primarily as a result of:
• a decrease of $658 million in access costs primarily as a result of pricing changes and usage
declines largely related to the shutdown of our competitors' third-generation (3G) networks in 2022
and ongoing efforts to migrate off network prepaid subscribers to the Verizon network;
• a decrease of $156 million in direct costs primarily related to certain professional services that
did not reoccur in 2023;
• an increase of $204 million in regulatory costs primarily related to a higher net Federal Universal
Service Fund (FUSF) rate; and
• an increase of $149 million in rent and lease expense primarily driven by new leases and lease
modifications related to the deployment of the C-Band spectrum.
 Cost of Wireless Equipment 
Cost of wireless equipment decreased during 2023 compared to 2022 primarily as a result of:
• a decrease of $4.7 billion driven by a lower volume of wireless devices sold primarily related to a
decrease of 24% in upgrades; and
• an increase of $953 million due to a shift to higher priced equipment in the mix of wireless
devices sold.
 Selling, General and Administrative Expense 
Selling, general and administrative expense includes salaries and wages and benefits not directly
attributable to a service or product, the provision for credit losses, taxes other than income taxes,
advertising and sales commission costs, call center and information technology costs, regulatory
fees, professional service fees and rent and utilities for administrative space. Also included is a
portion of the aggregate customer care costs as discussed above in "Cost of Services."
Selling, general and administrative expense increased during 2023 compared to 2022 primarily due to:
• an increase of $603 million in the provision for credit losses resulting from additional bad debt
reserves as collections return to pre-pandemic levels, coupled with an increase in wireless retail
postpaid gross additions;
• an increase of $533 million in personnel costs from severance charges;
• an increase of $458 million primarily related to asset rationalization charges;
• an increase of $393 million primarily related to higher costs for device insurance programs due to
an increase in claims;
• an increase of $299 million in advertising costs driven by costs associated with the myPlan launch
in the second quarter of 2023 and the scaling of our Total by Verizon prepaid brand;
• an increase of $161 million related to business transformation costs;
• an increase of $113 million in connection with the non-strategic business shutdown of our BlueJeans
business offering; and
• an increase of $100 million related to a legal settlement.
See "Special Items" for additional information on the severance charges, asset rationalization
charges, business transformation costs, the non-strategic business shutdown and the legal settlement.
 Depreciation and Amortization Expense 
Depreciation and amortization expense increased during 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to the
change in the mix of net depreciable and amortizable assets, including acquisition-related intangible
assets, and the continued deployment of C-Band network assets.

Other income (expense), net reflects certain items not directly related to our core operations,
including interest income, debt extinguishment costs, components of net periodic pension and
postretirement benefit cost and income and certain foreign exchange gains and losses.
Other income (expense), net decreased during 2023 compared to 2022 primarily due to:
• a net pension and postretirement benefits remeasurement loss of $992 million recorded during 2023,
compared with a gain of $1.7 billion recorded during 2022, as well as an increase in interest costs
in 2023 of $421 million primarily due to an increase in discount rates;
• net debt extinguishment gains of $308 million related to open market repurchases of various Company
notes and tender offers in 2023, compared with losses of $1.1 billion primarily related to tender
offers in 2022; and
• an increase in interest income due to higher interest rates.

average of prior thirteen-month end balances of total short-term and long-term debt, net of
discounts, premiums and unamortized debt issuance costs.
(2) The effective interest rate is the rate of actual interest incurred on debt. It is calculated by
dividing the total interest costs on debt balances by the average debt outstanding.
(3) We believe that this measure is useful to management, investors and other users of our financial
information in evaluating our debt financing cost and trends in our debt leverage management.
Total interest expense increased during 2023 compared to 2022 primarily as a result of an increase in
interest costs due to a higher average interest rate and a decrease in capitalized interest costs due
to the early clearance and deployment of C-Band spectrum in the current period, which were partially
offset by lower average debt balances.

Table of Contents
The effective income tax rate is calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by income
before the provision for income taxes. The increase in the effective income tax rate was primarily
due to the Verizon Business Group goodwill impairment charge of $5.8 billion that substantially
decreased income before income taxes and is not deductible. The decrease in the provision for income
taxes was primarily due to the decrease in income before income taxes in the current period.
A reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate to the effective income tax rate for each
period is included in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.
Consolidated Net Income, Consolidated EBITDA and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA
Consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization expense (Consolidated
EBITDA) and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, which are presented below, are non-GAAP financial measures
that we believe are useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in
evaluating operating profitability on a more variable cost basis as they exclude the depreciation and
amortization expense related primarily to capital expenditures and acquisitions that occurred in
prior years, as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to Verizon’s competitors.
Consolidated EBITDA is calculated by adding back interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
expense to net income.
Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by excluding from Consolidated EBITDA the effect of the
following non-operational items: equity in earnings and losses of unconsolidated businesses and other
income and expense, net, as well as the effect of certain special items. We believe that this measure
is useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating the
effectiveness of our operations and underlying business trends in a manner that is consistent with
management’s evaluation of business performance. We believe that Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is
widely used by investors to compare a company’s operating performance to its competitors by
minimizing impacts caused by differences in capital structure, taxes, and depreciation and
amortization policies. Further, the exclusion of non-operational items and special items enables
comparability to prior period performance and trend analysis. See "Special Items" for additional
information.
It is management’s intent to provide non-GAAP financial information to enhance the understanding of
Verizon’s GAAP financial information, and it should be considered by the reader in addition to, but
not instead of, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Each non-GAAP financial
measure is presented along with the corresponding GAAP measure so as not to imply that more emphasis
should be placed on the non-GAAP measure. We believe that providing these non-GAAP measures in
addition to the GAAP measures allows management, investors and other users of our financial
information to more fully and accurately assess both consolidated and segment performance. The non-
GAAP financial information presented may be determined or calculated differently by other companies
and may not be directly comparable to that of other companies.

connection with operating revenues and operating expenses.
 Segment Results of Operations 
We have two reportable segments that we operate and manage as strategic business units - Consumer and
Business. We measure and evaluate our segments based on segment operating income. The use of segment
operating income is consistent with the chief operating decision maker’s assessment of segment
performance.
To aid in the understanding of segment performance as it relates to segment operating income,
management uses the following operating statistics to evaluate the overall effectiveness of our
segments. We believe these operating statistics are useful to investors and other users of our
financial information because they provide additional insight into drivers of our segments’ operating
results, key trends and performance relative to our peers. These operating statistics may be
determined or calculated differently by other companies and may not be directly comparable to those
statistics of other companies.

Total broadband connections, net additions are the total number of additional total broadband
connections, less the number of total broadband disconnects in the period. Total broadband
connections, net additions in each period presented are calculated by subtracting the total broadband
disconnects, net of certain adjustments, from the total broadband new connections in the period.
Wireless churn is the rate at which service to retail, retail postpaid, or retail postpaid phone
connections is terminated on average in the period. The churn rate in each period presented is
calculated by dividing retail disconnects, retail postpaid disconnects, or retail postpaid phone
disconnects by the average retail connections, average retail postpaid connections, or average retail
postpaid phone connections, respectively, in the period.
Wireless retail postpaid ARPA is the calculated average retail postpaid service revenue per account
(ARPA) from retail postpaid accounts in the period. Wireless retail postpaid service revenue does not
include recurring device payment plan billings related to the Verizon device payment program, plan
billings related to device warranty and insurance or regulatory fees. Wireless retail postpaid ARPA
in each period presented is calculated by dividing retail postpaid service revenue by the average
retail postpaid accounts in the period.
Wireless retail postpaid accounts are wireless retail customers that are directly served and managed
under the Verizon brand and use its services as of the end of the period. Accounts include unlimited
plans, shared data plans and corporate accounts, as well as legacy single connection plans and multi-
connection family plans. A single account may include monthly wireless services for a variety of
connected devices. Wireless retail postpaid accounts are calculated by adding retail postpaid new
accounts to the prior period retail postpaid accounts.
Wireless retail postpaid connections per account is the calculated average number of retail postpaid
connections per retail postpaid account as of the end of the period. Wireless retail postpaid
connections per account is calculated by dividing the total number of retail postpaid connections by
the number of retail postpaid accounts as of the end of the period.

segment operating revenues.
Segment earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Segment EBITDA) , which is
presented below, is a non-GAAP measure and does not purport to be an alternative to operating income
(loss) as a measure of operating performance. We believe this measure is useful to management,
investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating operating profitability on a
more variable cost basis as it excludes the depreciation and amortization expense related primarily
to capital expenditures and acquisitions that occurred in prior years, as well as in evaluating
operating performance in relation to our competitors. Segment EBITDA is calculated by adding back
depreciation and amortization expense to segment operating income (loss). Segment EBITDA margin is
calculated by dividing Segment EBITDA by total segment operating revenues. See Note 13 to the
consolidated financial statements for additional information.

nm - not meaningful
Consumer's total operating revenues decreased during 2023 compared to 2022 as a result of decreases
in Wireless equipment revenue and Other revenue, partially offset by an increase in Service revenue.
 Service Revenue 
Service revenue increased during 2023 compared to 2022 primarily driven by an increase in Wireless
service revenue.
Wireless service revenue increased $1.8 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 primarily as a result
of:
• an increase of $1.7 billion in access revenues related to our postpaid plans primarily driven by
pricing actions implemented in recent periods; a larger allocation of administrative and telco
recovery charges, which partly recover network operating costs, to Wireless service revenue from
Other revenue; an increase in our FWA subscriber base; and an increase in device protection revenue
primarily due to an increase in the price of the bundled offering. These increases were partially
offset by the amortization of wireless equipment sales promotions;
• an increase of $405 million related to growth in non-retail service revenue;
• an increase of $287 million in TravelPass revenue related to increased customer international
travel; and
• a decrease of $500 million in prepaid revenue primarily due to a decrease in the prepaid subscriber
base.
 30 
Table of Contents
For the year ended December 31, 2023, Fios service revenue totaled $10.9 billion and remained
relatively flat compared to the similar period in 2022.
 Wireless Equipment Revenue 
Wireless equipment revenue decreased during 2023 compared to 2022 primarily as a result of:
• a decrease of $3.9 billion driven by a lower volume of wireless devices sold primarily related to a
decrease of 26% in upgrades; and
• an increase of $1.4 billion related to a shift to higher priced equipment in the mix of wireless
devices sold.
 Other Revenue 
Other revenue includes fees that partially recover the direct and indirect costs of complying with
regulatory and industry obligations and programs, revenues associated with certain products included
in our device protection offerings, leasing and interest recognized when equipment is sold to the
customer by an authorized agent under a device payment plan agreement.
Other revenue decreased during 2023 compared to 2022 primarily as a result of:
• a decrease of $1.2 billion in revenue primarily related to a larger allocation of administrative
and telco recovery charges, which partly recover network operating costs, to Wireless service revenue
from Other revenue; and
• an increase of $109 million in revenue from regulatory surcharges, primarily related to FUSF
surcharges driven by a higher net rate, partially offset by a decrease related to other regulatory
surcharges.

Cost of services decreased during 2023 compared to 2022 primarily as a result of:
• a decrease of $566 million in access costs primarily as a result of pricing changes, the shutdown
of our competitors' 3G networks in 2022 and ongoing efforts to migrate off network prepaid
subscribers to the Verizon network;
• an increase of $177 million in personnel costs mainly driven by a decrease in capitalized labor in
connection with the completion of our incremental C-Band capital spending program, and valuation
assumption changes in connection with certain post-employment benefits;
• an increase of $154 million in regulatory costs primarily related to a higher net FUSF rate; and
• an increase of $92 million in rent and lease expense primarily driven by new leases and lease
modifications related to the deployment of the C-Band spectrum.
 Cost of Wireless Equipment 
Cost of wireless equipment decreased during 2023 compared to 2022 primarily as a result of:
• a decrease of $4.1 billion driven by a lower volume of wireless devices sold primarily related to a
decrease of 26% in upgrades; and
• an increase of $858 million related to a shift to higher priced equipment in the mix of wireless
devices sold.
 Selling, General and Administrative Expense 
Selling, general and administrative expense increased during 2023 compared to 2022 primarily due to:
• an increase of $458 million in the provision for credit losses resulting from additional bad debt
reserves as collections return to pre-pandemic levels, coupled with an increase in wireless retail
postpaid gross additions;
• an increase of $352 million in advertising costs driven by costs associated with the myPlan launch
in the second quarter of 2023 and the scaling of our Total by Verizon prepaid brand; and
• an increase of $237 million in personnel costs mainly driven by an increase in commission expense
due to the amortization of deferred contract costs, along with an increase in costs associated with
third-party contracted resources.
 Depreciation and Amortization Expense 
Depreciation and amortization expense increased during 2023 compared to 2022 driven by the change in
the mix of total Verizon depreciable and amortizable assets and Consumer's usage of those assets.

Business's total operating revenues decreased during 2023 compared to 2022 as a result of decreases
in revenue from each of the three Business customer groups.
Business's total operating revenues increased during 2022 compared to 2021 as a result of an increase
in Business Markets and Other revenue, partially offset by decreases in Enterprise and Public Sector
and Wholesale revenues.
 Enterprise and Public Sector 
Enterprise and Public Sector offers wireless products and services as well as wireline connectivity
and managed solutions to our large business and government customers. Large businesses are identified
based on their size and volume of business with Verizon. Public sector offers these services with
features and pricing designed to address the needs of U.S. federal, state and local governments and
educational institutions.
Enterprise and Public Sector revenues decreased during 2023 compared to 2022 primarily due to:
• a decrease of $530 million in wireline networking revenue and traditional data and voice
communication services along with related professional services, driven by secular pressures in the
marketplace; and
• a decrease of $98 million in Wireless equipment revenue driven by a lower volume of devices sold
primarily related to fewer phone activations , partially offset by a shift to higher priced equipment
in the mix of devices sold.
Enterprise and Public Sector revenues decreased during 2022 compared to 2021 primarily as a result
of:
• a decrease of $763 million in wireline networking revenue and traditional data and voice
communication services along with related professional services, driven by secular pressures in the
marketplace;
• a decrease of $181 million due to lower FUSF volume and rate along with resulting surcharges;
• an increase of $152 million in Wireless equipment revenue driven by a shift to higher priced
equipment in the mix of devices sold and a higher volume of devices sold, partially offset by the
impact of related promotions;
• an increase of $84 million in Wireless service revenue primarily driven by an increase in wireless
retail postpaid connections as well as the economic adjustment charge that took effect late in the
second quarter of 2022; and
• an increase of $37 million in customer premise equipment primarily due to higher volumes.
 Business Markets and Other 
Business Markets and Other offers wireless services and equipment, conferencing services, tailored
voice and networking products, Fios services, advanced voice solutions and security services to
businesses that ordinarily do not meet the requirements to be categorized as Enterprise and Public
Sector, as described above. Business Markets and Other also includes solutions that support mobile
resource management.
Business Markets and Other revenue decreased during 2023 compared to 2022 primarily as a result of:
• a decrease of $267 million in Wireless equipment revenue primarily driven by a lower volume of
devices sold primarily related to fewer phone upgrades ;
• a decrease of $155 million in Other revenue primarily related to a larger allocation of
administrative and telco recovery charges, which partly recover network operating costs, to Wireless
service revenue from Other revenue;
• a decrease of $77 million related to a decrease in wireline voice and DSL service connections; and
• an increase of $496 million in Wireless service revenue primarily driven by the economic adjustment
charge that took effect late in the second quarter of 2022; an increase in our wireless retail
postpaid connections, including our FWA subscriber base; and a larger allocation of administrative
and telco recovery charges, which partly recover network operating costs, to Wireless service revenue
from Other revenue.
Business Markets and Other revenue increased during 2022 compared to 2021 primarily as a result of:
• an increase of $507 million in Wireless equipment revenue driven by a higher volume of devices sold
and a shift to higher priced equipment in the mix of devices sold, partially offset by an increase in
promotions;
• an increase of $395 million in Wireless service revenue primarily driven by an increase in our
wireless retail postpaid connections as well as the economic adjustment charge that took effect late
in the second quarter of 2022; and
• a decrease of $72 million related to a decrease in wireline voice and DSL service connections.
For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, Fios revenues totaled $923 million, $927
million and $905 million, respectively.
 Wholesale 
Wholesale offers wireline communications services including data, voice, local dial tone and
broadband services primarily to local, long distance, and wireless carriers that use our facilities
to provide services to their customers.
Wholesale revenues decreased during 2023 compared to 2022 primarily due to a decrease of $276 million
related to declines in traditional voice communication and network connectivity as a result of
technology substitution, certain fiber transactions completed in 2022 that did not reoccur, as well
as a decrease in core data.
 33 
Table of Contents
Wholesale revenues decreased during 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to a decrease of $113 million
related to declines in traditional voice communication and network connectivity as a result of
technology substitution and rationalization of international traffic, as well as a decrease in core
data.

decrease of 11% in upgrades ; and
• an increase of $174 million related to a shift to higher priced equipment in the mix of wireless
devices sold.
 Selling, General and Administrative Expense 
Selling, general and administrative expense increased during 2023 compared to 2022 primarily due to
an increase of $148 million in the provision for credit losses resulting from additional bad debt
reserves as collections return to pre-pandemic levels, coupled with an increase in wireless retail
postpaid gross additions.
 Depreciation and Amortization Expense 
Depreciation and amortization expense increased during 2023 compared to 2022 driven by the change in
the mix of total Verizon depreciable and amortizable assets and Business's usage of those assets.

Amortization of Acquisition-Related Intangible Assets
During 2023 and 2022, we recorded pre-tax amortization expense of $865 million and $826 million,
respectively, related to acquired intangible assets.
 Severance, Pension and Benefits Charges (Credits) 
During 2023, in accordance with our accounting policy to recognize actuarial gains and losses in the
period in which they occur, we recorded net pre-tax pension and benefits charges of $992 million in
our pension and postretirement benefit plans. The charges were recorded in Other income (expense),
net in our consolidated statement of income and were primarily driven by:
• a charge of $534 million due to an increase in our healthcare cost trend rate assumption used to
determine the current year liabilities of our postretirement benefit plans from a weighted-average of
6.6% at December 31, 2022 to a weighted-average of 7.3% at December 31, 2023;
• a charge of $503 million ($288 million for pension plans and $215 million for postretirement
benefit plans) due to a decrease in our discount rate assumption used to determine the current year
liabilities of our plans from a weighted-average of 5.2% at December 31, 2022 to a weighted-average
of 5.0% at December 31, 2023;
• a net credit of $45 million primarily due to other actuarial assumption adjustments, which includes
the difference between our estimated and our actual return on plan assets.
During 2023, we also recorded net pre-tax severance charges of $533 million, primarily related to
involuntary separations under our existing plans, in Selling, general and administrative expense in
our consolidated statement of income.
 35 
Table of Contents
During 2022, in accordance with our accounting policy to recognize actuarial gains and losses in the
period in which they occur, we recorded net pre-tax pension and benefits credits of $1.7 billion in
our pension and postretirement benefit plans. The credits were recorded in Other income (expense),
net in our consolidated statement of income and were primarily driven by:
• a credit of $7.0 billion ($4.1 billion for pension plans and $2.9 billion for postretirement
benefit plans) due to an increase in our discount rate assumption used to determine the current year
liabilities of our plans from a weighted-average of 2.9% at December 31, 2021 to a weighted-average
of 5.2% at December 31, 2022;
• a charge of $5.5 billion due to the difference between our estimated and actual return on assets;
and
• a credit of $206 million due to other actuarial assumption adjustments.
During 2022, we also recorded net pre-tax severance charges of $304 million, related to involuntary
separations under our existing plans, in Selling, general and administrative expense in our
consolidated statement of income.
Due to the presentation of the other components of net periodic benefit cost, we recognize a portion
of the pension and benefits charges (credits) in Other income (expense), net in our consolidated
statements of income.
See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to severance,
pension and benefits charges (credits).
 Verizon Business Group Goodwill Impairment 
During 2023, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $5.8 billion as a result of the annual goodwill
impairment test performed in the fourth quarter. See "Critical Accounting Estimates" for additional
information.
 Asset Rationalization 
During 2023, we recorded pre-tax asset rationalization charges of $480 million. Asset rationalization
charges of $155 million recorded during the second quarter of 2023 related to certain real estate and
non-strategic assets that we made a decision to cease use of as part of our transformation
initiatives. Asset rationalization charges of $325 million recorded during the fourth quarter of 2023
primarily related to Business network assets that we made a decision to cease use of as part of our
continued transformation initiatives.
 Legal Settlement 
During 2023, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $100 million related to the settlement of a litigation
matter regarding certain administrative fees.
 Business Transformation Costs 
During 2023, we recorded pre-tax charges of $176 million primarily related to costs incurred in
connection with strategic partnership initiatives in our managed network support services for certain
Business customers.
 Non-Strategic Business Shutdown 
During 2023, we recorded pre-tax charges of $179 million related to the shutdown of our BlueJeans
business offering.
 Early Debt Redemption Costs 
During 2022, we recorded pre-tax early debt redemption costs of $1.2 billion primarily in connection
with tender offers. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information
related to our early debt redemptions.
 Operating Environment and Trends 
The telecommunications industry is highly competitive. The rapid development of new technologies,
services and products has eliminated many of the distinctions among wireless, cable, internet and
traditional telephone services and brought new competitors to our markets. We expect competition to
remain intense as traditional and non-traditional participants seek increased market share.
We believe that our high-quality networks and customer base differentiate us from our competitors and
give us the ability to plan and manage through changing economic and competitive conditions. We
remain focused on executing on the fundamentals of the business: enhancing our networks, maintaining
a high-quality customer base, and delivering strong financial and operating results. We also continue
to focus on cost efficiencies in order to have flexibility to adjust to changes in the competitive
and economic environments and increase shareholder value.
The U.S. wireless market has achieved a high penetration of smartphones, which reduces the
opportunity for new phone connection growth for the industry. We expect the wireless industry's
customer growth rate to moderate over time in comparison to historical growth rates, furthering
competition for customers. Future revenue growth in the industry is expected to be driven by
expanding existing customer relationships, increasing the number of ways customers can connect with
wireless networks and
 36 
Table of Contents
services and increasing the penetration of FWA and connected devices including wearables, tablets and
IoT devices. Although certain use cases for 5G technologies and related ecosystems are in early
development stages, we expect that this technology will provide a significant opportunity for growth
in the coming years.
We expect future service revenue growth opportunities to arise from increased access revenue as
customer demand for mobile and FWA 5G connectivity continues to expand and customers shift to higher
access plans, driven in part by access to our high quality network. Additionally, we expect service
revenue to benefit from targeted pricing actions and increased connections per account. Future
service revenue growth opportunities will be dependent on expanding the penetration of our services,
increasing the number of ways that our customers can connect with our networks and services and the
development of new ecosystems.
With respect to wireless services and equipment, pricing plays an increasingly important role in the
wireless competitive landscape. As the demand for wireless services continues to grow, wireless
service providers are offering a range of service plans at competitive prices. In addition,
aggressive device promotions have become more common in recent years in an effort to encourage
customers to switch carriers, as well as retain existing customers. We compete in this area by
offering our customers services and devices that we believe provide significant value for the price.
We and other wireless service providers, as well as equipment manufacturers, offer device payment
options, which provide customers with the ability to pay for their device over a period of time, and
some providers offer device leasing arrangements.
For further details on competitive environment and trends, refer to "Business — Competition and
Related Trends" in Part I, Item 1 and "Risk Factors — Economic and Strategic Risks — We face
significant competition that may reduce our profits" in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form
10-K.
 Connection Trends 
In our Consumer segment, we are focused on attracting new customers and maintaining our high-quality
retail postpaid customer base by capitalizing on demand for reliable high-speed connectivity. We
believe the combination of our wireless network quality and service and product offerings represents
an attractive value proposition and provides a compelling customer experience, supporting increased
penetration of data services. While our Consumer segment experienced diminished connection growth in
recent years, we expect that future connection growth opportunities will be driven by the comparative
value we provide to our customers, as well as our FWA broadband service. In our prepaid business, we
expect to continue to operate in a highly competitive environment while making improvements to
achieve long-term growth.
We expect to continue to grow our Fios internet connections as we seek to increase our penetration
rates within our Fios service areas, further supported by the demand for higher speed internet
connections. At the same time, we expect continued growth of FWA connections to complement strong
Fios results as demand for broadband services continues to grow. In Fios video, the business
continues to face ongoing pressure as observed throughout the linear television market. We have
experienced continuing access line and DSL losses as customers have switched to alternative
technologies such as wireless, VoIP, and cable for voice and data services, and we expect this trend
to continue.
In our Business segment, we offer wireless products and services to business and government customers
across the U.S. We continue to grow our connections while operating in a highly competitive
environment. We expect that this connection growth, combined with our industry-leading network
assets, will provide additional opportunities to sell solutions, such as those around security,
private networking and other network connectivity services, advanced communications and professional
services.
In addition, in both our Consumer and our Business segments, we expect to support connection growth
in part by adding capacity and further expanding our wireless coverage, and by continuing the build-
out of our 5G network.
 Service Revenue Trends 
In our Consumer segment, we expect continued growth in our wireless service revenue, driven by
targeted pricing actions, migrations to higher priced plans, and increases in FWA connections. We
expect Fios revenue to benefit in 2024 as growth in our broadband customer base and an increased
demand for higher speed internet connections offset the impact of the shift from bundled wireline
services to standalone internet service.
In our Business segment, we expect wireless service revenue to expand, driven by growth from an
increase in wireless volumes and FWA contributions. We expect that Fios, through increased
penetration, will also contribute to revenue growth and that legacy traditional wireline services
will continue to face secular pressures.
 Cash Flow Trends 
We are focused on achieving profitable growth as we continue to deliver strong revenues and undertake
initiatives to reduce our overall cost structure. We expect that our ability to generate cash flows
will benefit from our expected service revenue growth and our anticipated reduction in capital
expenditures. See "Liquidity and Capital Resources" for additional information on our capital
program.
 37 
Table of Contents
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
We use the net cash generated from our operations to fund expansion and modernization of our
networks, service and repay external financing, pay dividends, invest in new businesses and spectrum
and, when appropriate, buy back shares of our outstanding common stock. Our sources of funds,
primarily from operations and, to the extent necessary, from external financing arrangements, are
sufficient to meet ongoing operating and investing requirements over the next 12 months and beyond.
Our cash and cash equivalents balance is $2.1 billion as of December 31, 2023. Our cash and cash
equivalents are held both domestically and internationally, and are invested to maintain principal
and provide liquidity. See "Market Risk" for additional information regarding our foreign currency
risk management strategies.
We expect that our capital spending requirements will continue to be financed primarily through
internally generated funds. Debt or equity financing may be needed to fund additional investments or
development activities, or to maintain an appropriate capital structure to ensure our financial
flexibility. Our external financing arrangements include credit facilities and other bank lines of
credit, an active commercial paper program, vendor financing arrangements, issuances of registered
debt or equity securities, U.S. retail medium-term notes and other securities that are privately-
placed or offered overseas. In addition, we monetize certain receivables through asset-backed debt
transactions.
 Capital Expenditures 
Our 2024 capital program includes capital to fund advanced networks and services, including expanding
and adding capacity and density to our core networks, deploying C-Band spectrum, and advancing our
network architecture. We anticipate cash requirements for our 2024 capital program to be between
$17.0 billion and $17.5 billion.
 Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
We have various contractual obligations and commitments. The following represent our anticipated
material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations as of December 31, 2023:
• Long-term debt, including current maturities, commitments of $149.2 billion, of which $12.3 billion
(including $3.6 billion of unsecured debt) are expected to be due within the next twelve months.
Related interest payments are $68.6 billion, of which $5.9 billion, are expected to be due within the
next twelve months. Items included in long-term debt with variable coupon rates exclude unamortized
debt issuance costs, and are described in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.
• Operating lease obligations of $28.4 billion and Finance lease obligations of $2.3 billion, of
which $4.8 billion and $793 million, respectively, are expected to be due within the next twelve
months. In addition, Verizon has an obligation of $378 million representing future minimum payments
under the sublease arrangement for our cell towers, of which $302 million is expected to be due
within the next twelve months. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional
information.
• Unconditional purchase obligations, with terms in excess of one year, amount to $21.7 billion, of
which $8.9 billion is expected to be due within the next twelve months. Items included in
unconditional purchase obligations are primarily commitments to purchase network equipment, software
and services, content, marketing services and other items which will be used or sold in the ordinary
course of business. These amounts do not represent our entire anticipated purchases in the future,
but represent only those items that are the subject of contractual obligations. We also purchase
products and services as needed with no firm commitment. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial
statements for additional information.
• Estimated commitments for our allocable share of clearing costs incurred by, and incentive payments
due to, the incumbent license holders associated with C-Band wireless spectrum acquired under Auction
107. The remaining commitment is estimated to be approximately $400 million, all of which is expected
to be due within the next twelve months.
• Other long-term liabilities, including current maturities, of $4.0 billion, of which approximately
$770 million is expected to be due within the next twelve months. Other long-term liabilities
represent estimated postretirement benefit and qualified pension plan contributions. Qualified
pension plan contributions include estimated minimum funding contributions. We expect that there will
be no required pension funding through the end of 2024, subject to changes in market conditions.
Postretirement benefit payments include future postretirement benefit payments. These estimated
amounts: (1) are subject to change based on changes to assumptions and future plan performance, which
could impact the timing and/or amounts of these payments; and (2) exclude expectations beyond 5 years
due to uncertainty of the timing and amounts.
• We are not able to make a reasonable estimate of when the unrecognized tax benefits balance of $2.7
billion and related interest and penalties will be settled with the respective taxing authorities
until the related tax audits are further developed or resolved. See Note 12 to the consolidated
financial statements for additional information.

 Cash Flows Provided By Operating Activities 
Our primary source of funds continues to be cash generated from operations. Net cash provided by
operating activities increased $334 million during 2023 compared to 2022 primarily due to an
improvement in working capital. The improvement in working capital was primarily driven by changes in
accounts payable as a result of timing, changes in inventory levels and fewer phone upgrades compared
to the prior year. This increase in net cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by
higher cash interest payments and a decrease in earnings. During 2023, we made a discretionary
contribution of $200 million to one of our qualified pension plans. Additionally, we expect that
there will be no required pension funding through the end of 2024, subject to changes in market
conditions.
 Cash Flows Used In Investing Activities 
 Capital Expenditures 
Capital expenditures continue to relate primarily to the use of capital resources to enhance the
operating efficiency and productivity of our networks, maintain our existing infrastructure,
facilitate the introduction of new products and services and enhance responsiveness to competitive
challenges.
Capital expenditures, including capitalized software, were $18.8 billion and $23.1 billion for 2023
and 2022, respectively. Capital expenditures decreased approximately $4.3 billion during 2023,
compared to 2022, primarily due to the completion of our accelerated $10 billion C-Band deployment
program in the first half of 2023. See "Global Network and Technology" for more details.
 Acquisitions of Wireless Licenses 
During 2023 and 2022, we made payments of $4.3 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, for
obligations related to clearing costs and accelerated clearing incentives associated with Auction 107
.
During 2023 and 2022, we recorded capitalized interest related to wireless licenses of $1.4 billion
and $1.7 billion, respectively.
In March 2022, Verizon signed agreements with satellite operators in which operators agreed to clear
C-Band spectrum in certain markets and frequencies ahead of the previously expected timeframe. During
2022, Verizon made payments of approximately $310 million associated with these agreements.
Collateral Receipts (Payments) Related to Derivative Contracts, Net
During 2023, we received return of collateral posted of $880 million related to derivative contracts,
net of payments. During 2022, we made collateral payments of $2.3 billion related to derivative
contracts, net of receipts. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional
information.
Cash Received Related to Acquisitions of Businesses, Net
On November 23, 2021 (the Acquisition Date), we completed the acquisition of TracFone Wireless, Inc.
(TracFone). During 2022, Verizon received net cash proceeds of $248 million for the final settlement
of working capital, which was included in our consideration as of the Acquisition Date. See Note 3 to
the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
 Cash Flows Used In Financing Activities 
We seek to maintain a mix of fixed and variable rate debt to lower borrowing costs within reasonable
risk parameters and to protect against earnings and cash flow volatility resulting from changes in
market conditions. During 2023 and 2022, net cash used in financing activities was $14.7 billion and
$8.5 billion, respectively.
 2023 
During 2023, our net cash used in financing activities of $14.7 billion was primarily driven by $11.0
billion used for dividend payments, $10.6 billion used for repayments and repurchases of long-term

partially offset by $8.6 billion provided by proceeds from long-term borrowings, which included $6.6
billion of proceeds from our asset-backed debt transactions.
Proceeds from and Repayments and Repurchases of Long-Term Borrowings
At December 31, 2023, our total debt increased to $150.7 billion compared to $150.6 billion at
December 31, 2022. Our effective interest rate was 4.9% and 3.7% during the years ended December 31,
2023 and 2022, respectively. We have entered into interest rate swaps to achieve a targeted mix of
fixed and variable rate debt, managing our exposure to changes in interest rates. See also "Market
Risk" and Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
At December 31, 2023, approximately $33.7 billion, or 21.7%, of the aggregate principal amount of our
total debt portfolio consisted of foreign denominated debt, primarily Euro and British Pound
Sterling. We have entered into cross currency swaps on our foreign denominated debt in order to fix
our future interest and principal payments in U.S. dollars and mitigate the impact of foreign
currency transaction gains or losses. See "Market Risk" for additional information.
Verizon may acquire debt securities issued by Verizon and its affiliates through open market
purchases, redemptions, privately negotiated transactions, tender offers, exchange offers, or
otherwise, upon such terms and at such prices as Verizon may from time to time determine, for cash or
other consideration.
 Other, Net 
Other, net financing activities during 2023 includes $302 million in payments made under the sublease
arrangement for our cell towers, $257 million in payments for TracFone contingent consideration and
$252 million in payments related to vendor financing arrangements. See Note 3 to the consolidated
financial statements for additional information on the TracFone contingent considerations.
 Dividends 
The Board of Directors of the Company assesses the level of our dividend payments on a periodic basis
taking into account such factors as long-term growth opportunities, internal cash requirements and
the expectations of our shareholders. During the third quarter of 2023, our Board of Directors
increased our quarterly dividend payment by 1.9% to $0.6650 from $0.6525 per share in the preceding
quarter. This is the seventeenth consecutive year that Company’s Board of Directors has approved a
quarterly dividend increase.
As in prior periods, dividend payments were a significant use of capital resources. During 2023, we
paid $11.0 billion in dividends.
 2022 
During 2022, our net cash used in financing activities of $8.5 billion was primarily driven by $13.6
billion used for repayments, redemptions and repurchases of long-term borrowings (secured and
unsecured) as well as finance lease obligations, $10.8 billion used for dividend payments and $2.1
billion used for other financing activities. These cash flows used in financing activities were
partially offset by $17.8 billion provided by proceeds from long-term borrowings, which included
$10.7 billion of proceeds from our asset-backed debt transactions.
Proceeds from and Repayments, Redemptions, and Repurchases of Long-Term Borrowings
At December 31, 2022, our total debt was $150.6 billion. During the year ended December 31, 2022, our
effective interest rate was 3.7%. We have entered into interest rate swaps to achieve a targeted mix
of fixed and variable rate debt, managing our exposure to changes in interest rates. See "Market
Risk" and Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
At December 31, 2022, approximately $34.0 billion, or 22.5%, of the aggregate principal amount of our
total debt portfolio consisted of foreign denominated debt, primarily Euro and British Pound
Sterling. We have entered into cross currency swaps on our foreign denominated debt in order to fix
our future interest and principal payments in U.S. dollars and mitigate the impact of foreign
currency transaction gains or losses. See "Market Risk" for additional information.
 Other, Net 
Other, net financing activities during 2022 includes the cash consideration payments to acquire
additional interests in certain controlled wireless partnerships and early debt redemption costs. See
Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the early debt
redemption costs.
 Dividends 
During the third quarter of 2022, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly dividend payment by
2.0% to $0.6525 per share.
During 2022, we paid $10.8 billion in dividends.

 Asset-Backed Debt 
As of December 31, 2023, the carrying value of our asset-backed debt was $22.2 billion. Our asset-
backed debt includes Asset-Backed Notes (ABS Notes) issued to third-party investors (Investors) and
loans (ABS Financing Facilities) received from banks and their conduit facilities (collectively, the
Banks). Our consolidated asset-backed debt bankruptcy remote legal entities (each, an ABS Entity, or
collectively, the ABS Entities) issue the debt or are otherwise party to the transaction
documentation in connection with our asset-backed debt transactions. Under the terms of our asset-
backed debt, Cellco Partnership (Cellco), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and certain other
Company affiliates (collectively, the Originators) transfer device payment plan agreement receivables
and certain other receivables (collectively referred to as certain receivables) or a participation
interest in certain other receivables to one of the ABS Entities, which in turn transfers such
receivables and participation interest to another ABS Entity that issues the debt. Verizon entities
retain the equity interests and residual interests, as applicable, in the ABS Entities, which
represent the rights to all funds not needed to make required payments on the asset-backed debt and
other related payments and expenses.
Our asset-backed debt is secured by the transferred receivables and participation interest, and
future collections on such receivables and underlying receivables related to such participation
interest. These receivables and participation interest transferred to the ABS Entities and related
assets, consisting primarily of restricted cash, will only be available for payment of asset-backed
debt and expenses related thereto, payments to the Originators in respect of additional transfers of
certain receivables and participation interest, and other obligations arising from our asset-backed
debt transactions, and will not be available to pay other obligations or claims of Verizon’s
creditors until the associated asset-backed debt and other obligations are satisfied. The Investors
or Banks, as applicable, which hold our asset-backed debt have legal recourse to the assets securing
the debt, but do not have any recourse to Verizon with respect to the payment of principal and
interest on the debt. Under a parent support agreement, the Company has agreed to guarantee certain
of the payment obligations of Cellco and the Originators to the ABS Entities.
Cash collections on the receivables and on the underlying receivables related to the participation
interest collateralizing our asset-backed debt securities are required at certain specified times to
be placed into segregated accounts. Deposits to the segregated accounts are considered restricted
cash and are included in Prepaid expenses and other and Other assets in our consolidated balance
sheets.
Proceeds from our asset-backed debt transactions are reflected in Cash flows from financing
activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. The asset-backed debt issued is included in
Debt maturing within one year and Long-term debt in our consolidated balance sheets.
See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

(1) The revolving credit facility does not require us to comply with financial covenants or maintain
specified credit ratings, and it permits us to borrow even if our business has incurred a material
adverse change. The revolving credit facility provides for the issuance of letters of credit. As of
December 31, 2023, there have been no drawings against the $9.5 billion revolving credit facility
since its inception.
(2) During 2023 and 2022, we drew down $1.0 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively, from these
facilities. Borrowings under certain of these facilities are amortized semi-annually in equal
installments up to the applicable maturity dates. Maturities reflect maturity dates of principal
amounts outstanding. Any amounts borrowed under these facilities and subsequently repaid cannot be
reborrowed.
 Common Stock 
Common stock has been used from time to time to satisfy some of the funding requirements of employee
and shareholder plans. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we issued 4.4 million and
2.1 million shares of common stock from treasury stock, which had aggregate values of $192 million
and $91 million, respectively.
In February 2020, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized a share buyback program to
repurchase up to 100 million shares of our common stock. The program will terminate when the
aggregate number of shares purchased reaches 100 million, or a new share repurchase plan superseding
the current plan is authorized, whichever is sooner. The program permits Verizon to
 41 
Table of Contents
repurchase shares over time, with the amount and timing of repurchases depending on market conditions
and corporate needs. There were no repurchases of common stock during 2023 and 2022 under our
authorized share buyback program.
 Credit Ratings 
Verizon’s credit ratings did not change in 2023 or 2022.
Securities ratings assigned by rating organizations are expressions of opinion and are not
recommendations to buy, sell or hold securities. A securities rating is subject to revision or
withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated
independently of any other rating.
 Covenants 
Our credit agreements contain covenants that are typical for large, investment grade companies. These
covenants include requirements to pay interest and principal in a timely fashion, pay taxes, maintain
insurance with responsible and reputable insurance companies, preserve our corporate existence, keep
appropriate books and records of financial transactions, maintain our properties, provide financial
and other reports to our lenders, limit pledging and disposition of assets and mergers and
consolidations, and other similar covenants.
We and our consolidated subsidiaries are in compliance with all of our restrictive covenants in our
debt agreements.
Change In Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash
Our Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2023 totaled $2.1 billion, a $540 million decrease
compared to December 31, 2022, primarily as a result of the factors discussed above.
Restricted cash at December 31, 2023 totaled $1.4 billion, a $74 million decrease compared to
restricted cash at December 31, 2022, primarily related to cash collections on certain receivables
and on the underlying receivables related to the participation interest that are required at certain
specified times to be placed into segregated accounts.
 Free Cash Flow 
Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that reflects an additional way of viewing our
liquidity that, we believe, when viewed with our GAAP results, provides management, investors and
other users of our financial information with a more complete understanding of factors and trends
affecting our cash flows. Free cash flow is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures (including
capitalized software) from net cash provided by operating activities. We believe it is a more
conservative measure of cash flow since capital expenditures are necessary for ongoing operations.
Free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow
available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does not incorporate payments
made on finance lease obligations or cash payments for business acquisitions or wireless licenses.
Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire
consolidated statements of cash flows.
The following table reconciles net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow:
 (dollars in millions) 
 Years Ended December 31, 2023 2022 
 ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── 
 Net cash provided by operating $ 37,475 $ 37,141 
 activities 
 Less Capital expenditures (including 18,767 23,087 
 capitalized software) 
 Free cash flow $ 18,708 $ 14,054 
The increase in free cash flow during 2023 is a reflection of the increase in operating cash flows,
as well as the decrease in capital expenditures, both of which are discussed above.
Employee Benefit Plans Funded Status and Contributions
 Employer Contributions 
We operate numerous qualified and nonqualified pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans.
These plans primarily relate to our domestic business units. During 2023, we made a discretionary
contribution of $200 million to one of our qualified pension plans. We made no discretionary
contributions to our qualified pension plans in 2022. During 2023 and 2022, we made contributions of
$52 million and $53 million to our nonqualified pension plans, respectively.
Our overall investment strategy is to achieve a mix of assets that allows us to meet projected
benefit payments while taking into consideration risk and return. In an effort to reduce the risk of
our portfolio strategy and better align assets with liabilities, we have adopted a liability driven
pension strategy that seeks to better match the interest rate sensitivity of the liability hedging
assets with the interest rate sensitivity of the liability. We expect that the strategy will reduce
the likelihood that assets will decline at a time when liabilities increase (referred to as liability
hedging), with the goal to reduce the risk of underfunding to the plan and its participants and
beneficiaries. Over time, as the asset allocation shifts to more liability hedging assets, this
strategy will
 42 
Table of Contents
generally result in lower expected asset returns. For 2024, we expect no required qualified pension
plan contributions and insignificant nonqualified pension plan contributions.
Contributions to our other postretirement benefit plans generally relate to payments for benefits on
an as-incurred basis since these other postretirement benefit plans do not have funding requirements
similar to the pension plans. We contributed $936 million and $692 million to our other
postretirement benefit plans in 2023 and 2022, respectively. Contributions to our other
postretirement benefit plans are estimated to be approximately $770 million in 2024.
 Leasing Arrangements 
See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to leasing
arrangements.
 Guarantees 
We guarantee the debentures of our operating telephone company subsidiaries. See Note 7 to the
consolidated financial statements for additional information.
In connection with the execution of agreements for the sale of businesses and investments, Verizon
ordinarily provides representations and warranties to the purchasers pertaining to a variety of
nonfinancial matters, such as ownership of the securities being sold, as well as financial losses.
See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
As of December 31, 2023, letters of credit totaling approximately $803 million, which were executed
in the normal course of business and support several financing arrangements and payment obligations
to third parties, were outstanding. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for
additional information.
 Other Future Obligations 
As of December 31, 2023, Verizon had 26 renewable energy purchase agreements (REPAs) with third
parties. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Under the
REPAs, we plan to purchase up to an aggregate of approximately 3.5 gigawatts of capacity across
multiple states.
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
A summary of the critical accounting estimates used in preparing our financial statements are as
follows:
 Wireless Licenses and Goodwill 
Wireless licenses and goodwill are a significant component of our consolidated assets. Both our
wireless licenses and goodwill are treated as indefinite-lived intangible assets and, therefore are
not amortized, but rather are tested for impairment annually in the fourth fiscal quarter, unless
there are events requiring an earlier assessment or changes in circumstances during an interim period
suggesting impairment indicators are present. We believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable
and represent appropriate marketplace considerations as of the valuation date. Although we use
consistent methodologies in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value
calculations used in our impairment tests, these estimates and assumptions are uncertain by nature,
may change over time and can vary from actual results. It is possible that in the future there may be
changes in our estimates and assumptions, including the timing and amount of future cash flows,
margins, growth rates, market participant assumptions, comparable benchmark companies and related
multiples and discount rates, which could result in different fair value estimates. Significant and
adverse changes to any one or more of the above-noted estimates and assumptions could result in an
impairment to our wireless licenses and goodwill impairment for one or more of our reporting units.
 Wireless Licenses 
The carrying value of our wireless licenses was approximately $155.7 billion as of December 31, 2023.
We aggregate our wireless licenses into one single unit of accounting, as we utilize our wireless
licenses on an integrated basis as part of our nationwide wireless network. Our wireless licenses
provide us with the exclusive right to utilize certain radio frequency spectrum to provide wireless
communication services. There are currently no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic
or other factors that limit the useful life of our wireless licenses.
We test our wireless licenses for potential impairment annually or more frequently if impairment
indicators are present. We have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine
whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. However, we may elect to bypass
the qualitative assessment in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative
impairment test. It is our policy to perform quantitative impairment assessment at least every three
years.
During the fourth quarter of 2023 and 2022, we performed a qualitative impairment assessment as our
annual impairment test to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our
wireless licenses was less than the carrying amount. As part of our qualitative assessment we
considered several factors including the business enterprise value of our combined wireless
 43 
Table of Contents
business, macroeconomic conditions (including changes in interest rates and discount rates), industry
and market considerations (including industry revenue and EBITDA margin results, projections and
recent merger and acquisition activity), the recent and projected financial performance of our
combined wireless business as a whole, as well as other factors including the result of our last
quantitative assessment. Our annual impairment tests in 2023 and 2022 indicated that it is more
likely than not that the fair value of our wireless licenses remained above their carrying value and,
therefore, did not result in an impairment.
 Goodwill 
At December 31, 2023, the balance of our goodwill was approximately $22.8 billion, of which $21.2
billion was in our Consumer reporting unit and $1.7 billion was in our Business reporting unit.
To determine if goodwill is potentially impaired, we have the option to perform a qualitative
assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is
less than its carrying value. If we elect not to conduct the qualitative assessment or if indications
of a potential impairment exist, the determination of whether an impairment has occurred requires the
fair value of each reporting unit to be assessed. It is our policy to perform quantitative impairment
assessments at least every three years.
Under the qualitative assessment, we consider several factors, including the business enterprise
value of the reporting unit from the last quantitative test and the excess of fair value over
carrying value from this test, macroeconomic conditions (including changes in interest rates and
discount rates), industry and market considerations (including industry revenue and EBITDA margin
results, projections and recent merger and acquisition activity), the recent and projected financial
performance of the reporting unit, as well as other factors.
Under the quantitative assessment, the fair value of the reporting unit is calculated using a market
approach and a discounted cash flow method, as a form of the income approach. The market approach
includes the use of comparative multiples to complement discounted cash flow results. The discounted
cash flow method is based on the present value of two components-projected cash flows and a terminal
value. The terminal value represents the expected normalized future cash flows of the reporting unit
beyond the cash flows from the discrete projection period. The fair value of the reporting unit is
calculated based on the sum of the present value of the cash flows from the discrete period and the
present value of the terminal value. The discount rate represents our estimate of the weighted-
average cost of capital, or expected return, that a marketplace participant would have required as of
the valuation date. The application of our goodwill impairment test requires key assumptions
underlying our valuation model. The discounted cash flow analysis factors in assumptions on discount
rates and terminal growth rates to reflect risk profiles of key strategic revenue and cost
initiatives, as well as revenue and EBITDA growth relative to history and market trends and
expectations. The market multiples approach reflects significant judgment involved in the selection
of comparable public company multiples and benchmarks. The selection of companies and multiples is
influenced by differences in growth and profitability, and volatility in market prices of peer
companies. These valuation inputs are inherently judgmental, and an adverse change in one or a
combination of these inputs could result in a goodwill impairment loss.
During the fourth quarter of 2023, we performed a qualitative impairment assessment for our Consumer
reporting unit. Our qualitative assessment indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair
value of our Consumer reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and, therefore, did not result in an
impairment.
During the fourth quarter of 2023, we performed a quantitative impairment assessment for our Business
reporting unit given the low excess of fair value over carrying value identified in our prior annual
impairment assessment and increased competitive and market pressures experienced throughout 2023.
These pressures have resulted in lower projected cash flows primarily driven by secular declines in
wireline services and products across our Business customer groups. In connection with Verizon’s
annual budget process in the fourth quarter of 2023, leadership completed a comprehensive five-year
strategic planning review of our Business reporting unit resulting in declines in financial
projections driven by market dynamics as compared to the prior year five-year strategic planning
cycle. The revised projections were used as a key input into the Business reporting unit’s annual
goodwill impairment test performed in the fourth quarter. In addition, changes in the macroeconomic
environment, including interest rate and inflationary pressures have also impacted the fair value of
the reporting unit.
We applied a combination of a market approach and a discounted cash flow method reflecting current
assumptions and inputs, including our revised projections, discount rate and expected growth rates,
which resulted in the determination that the fair value of our Business reporting unit was less than
its carrying amount. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2023 we recorded a non-cash goodwill
impairment charge of approximately $5.8 billion ($5.8 billion after-tax) in our consolidated
statement of income. The goodwill balance of the Business reporting unit was approximately $7.5
billion prior to the occurrence of this impairment charge. In our Business reporting unit, if all
other assumptions were to remain unchanged, we expect the impairment charge would increase by
approximately $1.0 billion if the terminal value growth rate declined by 50 basis points, or $1.3
billion if the discount rate increased by 50 basis points, or $1.1 billion if the EBITDA margin
decreased by 100 basis points. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional
information.
At December 31, 2023, the balance of goodwill in our Business reporting unit, after the goodwill
impairment charge, was $1.7 billion. Though we have determined that no further impairment exists for
our Business reporting unit as of December 31, 2023, a future projected sustained decline in the
reporting unit's revenues and earnings could have a significant negative impact on its fair value and
could result in future impairment charges. Such a decline could be driven by, among other things: (1)
 44 
Table of Contents
decreases in sales volumes or long-term growth rate as a result of competitive pressures or other
factors; or (2) the inability to achieve or delays in achieving the goals in our strategic
initiatives. Adverse changes to macroeconomic factors, such as increases in long-term interest rates,
would also negatively impact the fair value of the reporting unit.
At December 31, 2022, the balance of our goodwill was approximately $28.7 billion, of which $21.1
billion was in our Consumer reporting unit and $7.5 billion was in our Business reporting unit.
During the fourth quarter of 2022, we performed a qualitative impairment assessment for our Consumer
reporting unit. Our qualitative assessment indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair
value of our Consumer reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and, therefore, did not result in an
impairment. During the fourth quarter of 2022, we performed a quantitative impairment assessment for
our Business reporting unit. At the goodwill impairment measurement date of October 31, 2022, our
quantitative assessment indicated that the fair value for our Business reporting unit exceeded its
carrying amount by approximately 8% and, therefore, did not result in an impairment.
 Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans 
We maintain benefit plans for most of our employees, including, for certain employees, pension and
other postretirement benefit plans. Benefit plan assumptions, including the discount rate used, the
long-term rate of return on plan assets, the determination of the substantive plan and health care
trend rates are periodically updated and impact the amount of benefit plan income, expense, assets
and obligations. Changes to one or more of these assumptions could significantly impact our
accounting for pension and other postretirement benefits.
In determining pension and other postretirement obligations, the weighted-average discount rate was
selected to approximate the composite interest rates available on a selection of high-quality bonds
available in the market at December 31, 2023. The bonds selected had maturities that coincided with
the time periods during which benefit payments are expected to occur, were non-callable (or callable
with certain selection criteria met) and available in sufficient quantities to ensure marketability
(at least $300 million par outstanding). Bond yields are subject to uncertainty for a number of
reasons including corporate performance, credit rating downgrades and upgrades, government fiscal
policy decisions, and general market volatility. The expected long-term rates of return on plan
assets used in determining Verizon’s pension and other postretirement obligations are based on
expectations for future investment returns for the plans’ asset allocation. The rates are subject to
uncertainty for a number of reasons including corporate performance, credit ratings, monetary policy,
inflation, exchange rates, investor behavior and general market volatility.
A sensitivity analysis of the impact of changes in the discount rate and the long-term rate of return
on plan assets on the benefit obligations and expense (income) recorded, as well as an increase or a
decrease in the actual versus expected return on plan assets as of December 31, 2023 and for the year
then ended pertaining to Verizon’s pension and postretirement benefit plans, is provided in the table
below. The amounts in the table below related to discount rate changes are gross impacts on benefit
obligations and expense, and do not reflect changes in asset values as a result of interest rate
changes, for which our pension plan is highly hedged.
 Percentage point Increase/(decrease) at December 
 (dollars in millions) change 31, 2023 
 ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── 
 Pension plans discount rate +0.50 $ -691 
 -0.50 757 
 Rate of return on pension plan +1.00 -131 
 assets 
 -1.00 131 
 Postretirement plans discount rate +0.50 -520 
 -0.50 564 
 Rate of return on postretirement 
 plan +1.00 -4 
 assets 
 -1.00 4 
In addition to our liability hedging assets, we also employ an interest rate hedging strategy to
further minimize the impact of discount rate changes on the funded ratio of the pension plan. While
the target hedge ratio varies depending on the funded status of the plan and the level of interest
rates, the target hedge ratio was 80% at December 31, 2023, significantly limiting volatility.
The annual measurement date for both our pension and other postretirement benefits is December 31. We
use the full yield curve approach to estimate the interest cost component of net periodic benefit
cost for pension and other postretirement benefits. The full yield curve approach refines our
estimate of interest cost by applying the individual spot rates from a yield curve composed of the
rates of return on several hundred high-quality fixed income corporate bonds available at the
measurement date. These individual spot rates align with the timing of each future cash outflow for
benefit payments and therefore provide a more precise estimate of interest cost.
See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

 Income Taxes 
Our current and deferred income taxes and associated valuation allowances are impacted by events and
transactions arising in the normal course of business as well as in connection with the adoption of
new accounting standards, changes in tax laws and rates, acquisitions and dispositions of businesses
and non-recurring items. As a global commercial enterprise, our income tax rate and the
classification of income taxes can be affected by many factors, including estimates of the timing and
realization of deferred income tax assets and the timing and amount of income tax payments. We
account for tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns in accordance with the
accounting standard relating to the uncertainty in income taxes, which requires the use of a two-step
approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We
review and adjust our liability for unrecognized tax benefits based on our best judgment given the
facts, circumstances and information available at each reporting date. To the extent that the final
outcome of these tax positions is different than the amounts recorded, such differences may impact
income tax expense and actual tax payments. We recognize any interest and penalties accrued related
to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. Actual tax payments may materially differ from
estimated liabilities as a result of changes in tax laws as well as unanticipated transactions
impacting related income tax balances. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for
additional information.
 Property, Plant and Equipment 
Our Property, plant and equipment balance represents a significant component of our consolidated
assets. We record property, plant and equipment at cost. We depreciate property, plant and equipment
on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets. The estimated useful life is
subject to change due to a variety of factors such as change in asset capacity or performance,
technical obsolescence, market expectations and competition impacts. In connection with our ongoing
review of the estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment during 2023, we determined that
the estimated useful life of our property, plant and equipment would remain unchanged. We expect that
a one year increase in estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment would result in a
decrease to our 2023 depreciation expense of $2.3 billion and that a one year decrease would result
in an increase of approximately $3.6 billion in our 2023 depreciation expense.
 Accounts Receivable 
Accounts receivable are recorded at amortized cost less an allowance for credit losses that are not
expected to be recovered. The gross amount of accounts receivable and corresponding allowance for
credit losses are presented separately in the consolidated balance sheets. We maintain allowances for
credit losses resulting from the expected failure or inability of our customers to make required
payments. We recognize the allowance for credit losses at inception and reassess quarterly based on
management’s expectation of the asset’s collectability. The allowance is based on multiple factors
including historical experience with bad debts, the credit quality of the customer base, the aging of
such receivables and current macroeconomic conditions, as well as management’s expectations of
conditions in the future, as applicable. The impact of these factors on the allowance involves
significant level of estimation and is subject to uncertainty. Our allowance for credit losses is
based on management’s assessment of the collectability of assets pooled together with similar risk
characteristics.
We record an allowance to reduce the receivables to the amount that is expected to be collectible.
For device payment plan agreement receivables, we record bad debt expense based on a default and loss
calculation using our proprietary loss model. The expected loss rate is determined based on customer
credit scores and other qualitative factors as noted above. The loss rate is assigned individually on
a customer by customer basis and the custom credit scores are then aggregated by vintage and used in
our proprietary loss model to calculate the weighted-average loss rate used for determining the
allowance balance. The weighted-average expected loss rate increased 1.36% at December 31, 2023 as
compared to at December 31, 2022. We expect that an increase or decrease of 0.25% in the weighted-
average loss rate would result in a change of $111 million in bad debt expense.
We monitor the collectability of our wireless service receivables as one overall pool. Wireline
service receivables are disaggregated and pooled by the following customer groups: consumer, small
and medium business, enterprise, public sector and wholesale. For wireless service receivables and
wireline consumer and small and medium business receivables, the allowance is calculated based on a
12 month rolling average write-off balance multiplied by the average life-cycle of an account from
billing to write-off. The risk of loss is assessed over the contractual life of the receivables and
is adjusted based on the historical loss amounts for current and future conditions based on
management’s qualitative considerations. For enterprise, public sector and wholesale wireline
receivables, the allowance for credit losses is based on historical write-off experience and
individual customer credit risk, as applicable. We consider multiple factors in determining the
allowance as discussed above.
If there is a deterioration of our customers’ financial condition or if future actual default rates
on receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, we may have to adjust our
allowance for credit losses, which would affect earnings in the period the adjustments are made. See
Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

 Acquisitions and Divestitures 
 Spectrum License Transactions 
From time to time we enter into agreements to buy, sell or exchange spectrum licenses. We believe
these spectrum license transactions have allowed us to continue to enhance the reliability of our
wireless network while also resulting in a more efficient use of spectrum.
In February 2021, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) concluded Auction 107 for C-Band
wireless spectrum. Verizon paid $45.5 billion for the licenses it won, of which $44.6 billion was
paid in the first quarter of 2021. In accordance with the rules applicable to the auction, Verizon is
required to make payments for our allocable share of clearing costs incurred by, and incentive
payments due to, the incumbent license holders associated with the auction, which are estimated to be
$7.6 billion. During 2023 and 2022, we made payments of $4.3 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively,
for obligations related to clearing costs and accelerated clearing incentives. During 2021, we made
payments of $1.3 billion primarily related to certain obligations for projected clearing costs. We
expect to continue to make payments of approximately $400 million for the remaining obligations
through 2024. The final timing and amounts of these payments could differ based on the actual amount
of incumbent holders’ reimbursement claims and the speed with which those claims are approved and
processed. The carrying value of the wireless spectrum won in Auction 107 consists of all payments
required to participate and purchase licenses in the auction, including Verizon’s allocable share of
clearing costs incurred by, and incentive payments due to, the incumbent license holders associated
with the auction that we are obligated to pay in order to acquire the licenses, as well as
capitalized interest to the extent qualifying activities have occurred.
In March 2022, Verizon signed agreements with satellite operators in which operators agreed to clear
C-Band spectrum in certain markets and frequencies ahead of the previously expected timeframe. During
2022, Verizon incurred costs associated with these agreements of approximately $340 million, of which
$310 million was paid as of December 31, 2022 and the remainder was paid in 2023. This early
clearance accelerated Verizon's access to more spectrum in a number of key markets to support its 5G
network initiatives.
See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our spectrum
license transactions.
 TracFone Wireless, Inc. 
In November 2021, we completed the acquisition of TracFone. Verizon acquired all of TracFone's
outstanding stock in exchange for approximately $3.5 billion in cash, net of cash acquired and
working capital and other adjustments, 57,596,544 shares of common stock of the Company valued at
approximately $3.0 billion, and up to an additional $650 million in future cash contingent
consideration related to the achievement of certain performance measures and other commercial
arrangements. The fair value of the common stock was determined on the basis of its closing market
price on the Acquisition Date. The estimated fair value of the contingent consideration as of the
Acquisition Date was approximately $560 million and represents a Level 3 measurement. The contingent
consideration payable is based on the achievement of certain revenue and operational targets,
measured over a two year earn out period. During 2023 and 2022, Verizon made payments of $257 million
and $188 million, respectively, related to the contingent consideration, which is reflected in Cash
flows from financing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. See Note 3 and Note 9
to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
 Verizon Media Divestiture 
On September 1, 2021, we completed the sale of Verizon Media Group. As of the close of the
transaction, cash proceeds, the fair value of the non-convertible preferred limited partnership units
of an affiliate of Apollo Global Management Inc. (the Apollo Affiliate) and the fair value of 10% of
the fully-diluted common limited partnership units of the Apollo Affiliate were $4.3 billion, $496
million, and $124 million, respectively. We recorded a pre-tax gain on sale of approximately $1.0
billion (after-tax $1.0 billion) in Selling general and administrative expense in our consolidated
statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2021. In addition, we incurred $346 million of
various costs associated with this disposition which are primarily recorded in Selling general and
administrative expense in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2021.
See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures 
 About Market Risk 
We are exposed to various types of market risk in the normal course of business, including the impact
of interest rate changes, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, changes in investment, equity
and commodity prices and changes in corporate tax rates. We employ risk management strategies, which
may include the use of a variety of derivatives including cross currency swaps, forward starting
interest rate swaps, interest rate swaps, interest rate caps, treasury rate locks and foreign
exchange forwards. We do not hold derivatives for trading purposes.
It is our general policy to enter into interest rate, foreign currency and other derivative
transactions only to the extent necessary to achieve our desired objectives in optimizing exposure to
various market risks. Our objectives include maintaining a mix of fixed and variable rate debt to
lower borrowing costs within reasonable risk parameters and to protect against earnings and cash flow
 47 
Table of Contents
volatility resulting from changes in market conditions. We do not hedge our market risk exposure in a
manner that would completely eliminate the effect of changes in interest rates and foreign exchange
rates on our earnings.
Counterparties to our derivative contracts are major financial institutions with whom we have
negotiated derivatives agreements (ISDA master agreements) and credit support annex (CSA) agreements
which provide rules for collateral exchange. The CSA agreements contain fixed cap amounts or rating
based thresholds such that we or our counterparties may be required to hold or post collateral based
upon changes in outstanding positions as compared to established thresholds or caps and changes in
credit ratings. We do not offset fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments and fair
value amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral or the obligation to return cash
collateral arising from derivative instruments recognized at fair value. At both December 31, 2023
and 2022, we did not hold any collateral. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, we posted $1.4 billion and
$2.3 billion, respectively, of collateral related to derivative contracts under collateral exchange
agreements, which were recorded as Prepaid expenses and other in our consolidated balance sheets.
While we may be exposed to credit losses due to the nonperformance of our counterparties, we consider
the risk remote and do not expect that any such nonperformance would result in a significant effect
on our results of operations or financial condition due to our diversified pool of counterparties.
See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the
derivative portfolio.
 Interest Rate Risk 
We are exposed to changes in interest rates, primarily on our short-term debt and the portion of
long-term debt that carries floating interest rates. As of December 31, 2023, approximately 76% of
the aggregate principal amount of our total debt portfolio consisted of fixed-rate indebtedness,
including the effect of interest rate swap agreements designated as hedges. The impact of a
100-basis-point change in interest rates affecting our floating rate debt would result in a change in
annual interest expense, including our interest rate swap agreements that are designated as hedges,
of approximately $379 million. The interest rates on our existing long-term debt obligations are
unaffected by changes to our credit ratings.
U.S. dollar London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) rates ceased publication on June 30, 2023.
Outstanding debt and derivative transactions that were benchmarked to LIBOR were repaid or
transitioned to interest rates that are linked to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate as the
benchmark rate by June 30, 2023. There was not a significant impact to our financial position given
our current mix of variable and fixed-rate debt and taking into account the impact of our interest
rate hedging.
The table that follows summarizes the fair values of our long-term debt, including current
maturities, and interest rate swap derivatives as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. The table also
provides a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair values of these financial instruments assuming
100-basis-point upward and downward shifts in the yield curve. Our sensitivity analysis does not
include the fair values of our commercial paper and bank loans, if any, because they are not
significantly affected by changes in market interest rates.

 Interest Rate Swaps 
We enter into interest rate swaps to achieve a targeted mix of fixed and variable rate debt. We
principally receive fixed rates and pay variable rates, resulting in a net increase or decrease to
Interest expense. These swaps are designated as fair value hedges and hedge against interest rate
risk exposure of designated debt issuances. At December 31, 2023, the fair value of the liability of
these contracts was $4.5 billion. At December 31, 2022, the fair value of the liability of these
contracts was $4.6 billion. At both December 31, 2023 and 2022, the total notional amount of the
interest rate swaps was $26.1 billion.
 Foreign Currency Risk 
The functional currency for our foreign operations is primarily the local currency. The translation
of income statement and balance sheet amounts of our foreign operations into U.S. dollars is recorded
as cumulative translation adjustments, which are included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss in
our consolidated balance sheets. Gains and losses on foreign currency transactions are recorded in
the consolidated statements of income. At December 31, 2023, our primary translation exposure was to
the British Pound Sterling, Euro, Australian Dollar and Swedish Krona.
 Cross Currency Swaps 
We have entered into cross currency swaps to exchange our British Pound Sterling, Euro, Swiss Franc,
Canadian Dollar and Australian Dollar-denominated cash flows into U.S. dollars and to fix our cash
payments in U.S. dollars, as well as to mitigate the impact of foreign currency transaction gains or
losses. On March 31, 2022, we voluntarily elected to de-designate our cross currency swaps previously
designated as cash flow hedges and re-designated the swaps as fair value hedges. Subsequently
 48 
Table of Contents
executed cross currency swaps are also designated as fair value hedges. The fair value of the asset
of these contracts was $762 million and $305 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. At
December 31, 2023 and 2022, the fair value of the liability of these contracts was $2.1 billion and
$3.6 billion, respectively. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the total notional amount of the cross
currency swaps was $33.5 billion and $35.0 billion, respectively.
 Foreign Exchange Forwards 
We also have foreign exchange forwards which we use as an economic hedge but for which we have
elected not to apply hedge accounting. We enter into British Pound Sterling and Euro foreign exchange
forwards to mitigate our foreign exchange rate risk related to non-functional currency denominated
monetary assets and liabilities of international subsidiaries.
At both December 31, 2023 and 2022, the fair value of the asset and liability of these contracts was
insignificant. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the total notional amount of the foreign exchange
forwards was $1.1 billion and $920 million, respectively.

 Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary 
 Data 
 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting 
 Firm 
To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Verizon Communications Inc.:
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited Verizon Communications Inc. and subsidiaries’ (Verizon) internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control –
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Verizon maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on the COSO
criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of Verizon as of December 31, 2023 and
2022, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and changes in
equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes and
the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) and our report dated February 9,
2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
 Basis for Opinion 
Verizon’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Verizon’s internal control over financial reporting
based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be
independent with respect to Verizon in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the
applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing
the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as
we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,
use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting 
 Firm 
To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Verizon Communications Inc.:
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Verizon Communications Inc. and
subsidiaries (Verizon or the Company) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated
statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and changes in equity for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes and the financial statement
schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial
statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Verizon at December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States) (PCAOB), Verizon’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February
9, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
 Basis for Opinion 
These financial statements are the responsibility of Verizon’s management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on Verizon’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting
firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to Verizon in
accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing
procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to
error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included
examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial
statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 Critical Audit Matters 
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of
the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee
and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2)
involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical
audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken
as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate
opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
 Valuation of Employee Benefit Obligations 
 The Company sponsors several pension plans and other post-employment 
 benefit plans. At December 31, 2023, the Company’s aggregate defined 
 benefit pension obligation was $15.1 billion and exceeded the fair 
 value of pension plan assets of $13.5 billion, resulting in an 
 unfunded defined benefit pension obligation of $1.6 billion. Also, 
 at December 31, 2023, the other postretirement benefits obligation 
 was approximately $11.5 billion. As explained in Note 11 of the 
 Description of the Matter consolidated financial statements, the Company updates the estimates 
 used to measure employee benefit obligations and plan assets in the 
 fourth quarter and upon a remeasurement event to reflect the actual 
 return on plan assets and updated actuarial assumptions. 
 Auditing the employee benefit obligations was complex due to the 
 highly judgmental nature of the actuarial assumption relating to the 
 discount rates used in the measurement process. This assumption had 
 a significant effect on the projected benefit obligations. 
 51 
Table of Contents
 We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design 
 and tested the operating effectiveness of controls 
 over the employee benefits obligation valuation 
 process. For example, we tested controls over 
 management’s review of the employee benefit 
 obligation calculations, the actuarial assumption 
 relating to the discount rates and the data inputs 
 provided to the actuary. 
 To test the employee benefit obligations, our audit 
 procedures included, among others, evaluating the 
 methodologies used, the actuarial assumption relating 
 to the discount rates and the underlying data used by 
 the Company. We compared the actuarial assumption 
 used by management to historical trends, current 
 How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit economic factors and evaluated the change in the 
 employee benefit obligations from prior year due to 
 the change in service cost, interest cost, actuarial 
 gains and losses, benefit payments, contributions and 
 other activities. In addition, we involved an 
 actuarial specialist to assist in evaluating 
 management’s methodology for determining the discount 
 rates that reflect the maturity and duration of the 
 benefit payments and are used to measure the employee 
 benefit obligations. As part of this assessment, we 
 compared the projected cash flows to prior year 
 projections and compared the current year benefits 
 paid to the prior year projected cash flows. We also 
 tested the completeness and accuracy of the 
 underlying data. 
 Impairment Evaluation for Verizon Business Group 
 Goodwill 
 At December 31, 2023, the Company’s goodwill related 
 to its Verizon Business Group (Business) reporting 
 unit was $1.7 billion and represented 0.4% of total 
 assets. As discussed in Notes 1 and 4 of the 
 consolidated financial statements, goodwill is not 
 amortized but rather is tested for impairment at the 
 reporting unit level at least annually, or more 
 frequently if impairment indicators are present. The 
 impairment test compares the fair value of the 
 reporting unit (calculated using a combination of a 
 market approach and an income approach) to its 
 carrying amount. As described in Note 4 to the 
 consolidated financial statements, an impairment 
 Description of the Matter charge of $5.8 billion in the Business reporting unit 
 was recorded during the year. 
 Auditing management’s goodwill impairment test was 
 complex and highly judgmental due to the inherent 
 subjectivity of developing an estimate of the fair 
 value of the reporting unit, which is based on 
 assumptions about future conditions, transactions, or 
 events whose outcome is uncertain and will therefore 
 be subject to change over time. In particular, the 
 fair value estimate was sensitive to significant 
 assumptions such as the discount rate, revenue growth 
 rates and earnings before interest, taxes, 
 depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) margins, which 
 are affected by expected future market and economic 
 conditions. 
 We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design 
 and tested the operating effectiveness of controls 
 over the Company’s goodwill impairment review 
 process. For example, we tested controls over 
 management’s review of the valuation models and the 
 significant assumptions described above. 
 To test the estimated fair value of the Company’s 
 Business reporting unit, our audit procedures 
 included, among others, assessing the suitability and 
 application of the valuation methodologies selected 
 and evaluating the significant assumptions discussed 
 above and underlying data used by the Company in its 
 analysis. We compared the significant assumptions 
 How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit used by management to current industry and economic 
 trends, market information, and other relevant 
 factors. We performed sensitivity analyses of 
 significant assumptions to determine what changes in 
 assumptions are particularly sensitive when assessing 
 the likelihood of impairment, or when calculating the 
 amount of an impairment. In addition, we involved a 
 valuation specialist to assist in the evaluation of 
 the assumptions and other relevant information that 
 are most significant to the fair value estimate. We 
 also assessed the historical accuracy of management’s 
 forecasts of financial results used in developing 
 prior fair value estimates to assist in evaluating 
 the reliability of the current forecasts.

 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
 Verizon Communications Inc. and Subsidiaries 
 Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of 
 Significant Accounting Policies 
Description of Business
Verizon Communications Inc. (the Company) is a holding company that, acting through its subsidiaries
(together with the Company, collectively, Verizon), is one of the world’s leading providers of
communications, technology, information and entertainment products and services to consumers,
businesses and government entities. With a presence around the world, we offer data, video and voice
services and solutions on our networks and platforms that are designed to meet customers’ demand for
mobility, reliable network connectivity and security.
We have tworeportable segments that we operate and manage as strategic business units - Verizon
Consumer Group (Consumer) and Verizon Business Group (Business).
Our Consumer segment provides consumer-focused wireless and wireline communications services and
products. Our wireless services are provided across one of the most extensive wireless networks in
the United States (U.S.) under the Verizon family of brands and through wholesale and other
arrangements. We also provide fixed wireless access (FWA) broadband through our fifth-generation (5G)
or fourth-generation (4G) Long-Term Evolution (LTE) networks as an alternative to traditional
landline internet access. Our wireline services are provided in ninestates in the Mid-Atlantic and
Northeastern U.S., as well as Washington D.C., over our 100% fiber-optic network through our Verizon
Fios product portfolio and over a traditional copper-based network to customers who are not served by
Fios. Our Consumer segment's wireless and wireline products and services are available to our retail
customers, as well as resellers that purchase wireless network access from us on a wholesale basis.
Our Business segment provides wireless and wireline communications services and products, including
FWA broadband, data, video and conferencing services, corporate networking solutions, security and
managed network services, local and long distance voice services and network access to deliver
various Internet of Things (IoT) services and products. We provide these products and services to
businesses, government customers and wireless and wireline carriers across the U.S. and a subset of
these products and services to customers around the world. During the first quarter of 2023, Verizon
reorganized the customer groups within its Business segment . See Note 13 for additional information.
Consolidation
The method of accounting applied to investments, whether consolidated or equity, involves an
evaluation of all significant terms of the investments that explicitly grant or suggest evidence of
control or influence over the operations of the investee. The consolidated financial statements
include our controlled subsidiaries, as well as variable interest entities (VIE) where we are deemed
to be the primary beneficiary. For controlled subsidiaries that are not wholly-owned, the
noncontrolling interests are included in Net income and Total equity. Investments in businesses that
we do not control, but have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and
financial policies, are accounted for using the equity method. Equity method investments are included
in Investments in unconsolidated businesses in our consolidated balance sheets. All significant
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
Basis of Presentation
We have reclassified certain prior year amounts to conform to the current year presentation.
Use of Estimates
We prepare our financial statements using U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), which
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and disclosures.
These estimates and assumptions take into account historical and forward-looking factors that the
Company believes are reasonable, including but not limited to public health crises and related
economic implications. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.
Examples of significant estimates include the allowance for credit losses, the recoverability of
intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, and other long-lived assets, the incremental
borrowing rate for the lease liability, fair value measurements, including those related to financial
instruments, goodwill, spectrum licenses and intangible assets, unrecognized tax benefits, valuation
allowances on tax assets, pension and postretirement benefit obligations, contingencies and the
identification and valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with business
combinations.
Revenue Recognition
We earn revenue from contracts with customers, primarily through the provision of telecommunications
and other services and through the sale of wireless equipment. These services include a variety of
communication and connectivity services for our Consumer and Business customers including other
carriers that use our facilities to provide services to their customers, as well as professional and
integrated managed services for our large enterprise and government customers. We account for these
revenues under Topic 606.
 58 
Table of Contents
We also earn revenues that are not accounted for under Topic 606 from leasing arrangements (such as
those for towers and equipment), captive reinsurance arrangements primarily related to wireless
device insurance and the interest recognized when equipment is sold to the customer by an authorized
agent under a device payment plan agreement.
Nature of Products and Services
Telecommunications
Service
We offer wireless services through a variety of plans on a postpaid or prepaid basis. For wireless
service, we recognize revenue using an output method, either as the service allowance units are used
or as time elapses, because it reflects the pattern by which we satisfy our performance obligation
through the transfer of service to the customer. Monthly service is generally billed in advance,
which results in a contract liability. See Note 2 for additional information. For postpaid plans,
where monthly usage exceeds the allowance, the overage usage represents options held by the customer
for incremental services and the usage-based fee is recognized when the customer exercises the option
(typically on a month-to-month basis).
For our contracts related to wireline communication and connectivity services, in general, fixed
monthly fees for service are billed one month in advance, which results in a contract liability, and
service revenue is recognized over the enforceable contract term as the service is rendered, as the
customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the services through network access and
usage. While substantially all of our wireline service revenue contracts are the result of providing
access to our networks, revenue from services that are not fixed in amount and, instead, are based on
usage are generally billed in arrears and recognized as the usage occurs.
Equipment
We sell wireless devices and accessories under the Verizon brand and other brands. Equipment revenue
is generally recognized when the products are delivered to and accepted by the customer, as this is
when control passes to the customer. In addition to offering the sale of equipment on a standalone
basis, we have twoprimary offerings through which customers pay for a wireless device, in connection
with a service contract: fixed-term plans (for our Business customers) and device payment plans.
Under a fixed-term plan, the customer is sold the wireless device without any upfront charge or at a
discounted price in exchange for entering into a fixed-term service contract (typically for a term of
24months or less).
Under a device payment plan, the customer is sold the wireless device in exchange for a non-interest-
bearing installment note, which is repaid by the customer, typically over a 36-monthterm, and
concurrently enters into a month-to-month contract for wireless service. We may offer certain
promotions that provide billing credits applied over a specified term, contingent upon the customer
maintaining service. The credits are included in the transaction price, which are allocated to the
performance obligations based on their relative selling price and are recognized when earned.
A financing component exists in both our fixed-term plans and device payment plans because the timing
of the payment for the device, which occurs over the contract term, differs from the satisfaction of
the performance obligation, which occurs at contract inception upon transfer of the device to the
customer. We periodically assess, at the contract level, the significance of the financing component
inherent in our fixed-term and device payment plan receivable based on qualitative and quantitative
considerations related to our customer classes. These considerations include assessing the commercial
objective of our plans, the term and duration of financing provided, interest rates prevailing in the
marketplace, and credit risks of our customer classes, all of which impact our selection of
appropriate discount rates. Based on current facts and circumstances, we determined that the
financing component in our existing wireless device payments and fixed-term contracts sold through
the direct channel is not significant and therefore is not accounted for separately. See Note 8 for
additional information on the interest on equipment financed on a device payment plan agreement when
sold to the customer by an authorized agent in our indirect channel.
Wireless Contracts
For our wireless contracts, total contract revenue, which represents the transaction price for
wireless service and wireless equipment, is allocated between service and equipment revenue based on
their estimated standalone selling prices. We estimate the standalone selling price of the device or
accessory to be its retail price excluding subsidies or conditional purchase discounts. We estimate
the standalone selling price of wireless service to be the price that we offer to customers on month-
to-month contracts that can be cancelled at any time without penalty (i.e., when there is no fixed-
term for service) or when service is procured without the concurrent purchase of a wireless device.
In addition, we also assess whether the service term is impacted by certain legally enforceable
rights and obligations in our contract with customers, such as penalties that a customer would have
to pay to early terminate a fixed-term contract or billing credits that would cease if the month-to-
month wireless service is canceled. The assessment of these legally enforceable rights and
obligations involves judgment and impacts our determination of the transaction price and related
disclosures.
From time to time, we may offer certain promotions that provide our customers on device payment plans
with the right to upgrade to a new device after paying a specified portion of their device payment
plan agreement amount and trading in their device in good working order. We account for this trade-in
right as a guarantee obligation. The full amount of the trade-in right's fair value
 59 
Table of Contents
is recognized as a guarantee liability and results in a reduction to the revenue recognized upon the
sale of the device. The total transaction price is reduced by the guarantee, which is accounted for
outside the scope of Topic 606, and the remaining transaction price is allocated between the
performance obligations within the contract.
Our fixed-term plans generally include the sale of a wireless device at subsidized prices. This
results in the creation of a contract asset at the time of sale, which represents the recognition of
equipment revenue in excess of amounts billed.
For our device payment plans, billing credits are accounted for as consideration payable to a
customer and are included in the determination of total transaction price, resulting in a contract
liability.
We may provide a right of return on our products and services for a short time period after a sale.
These rights are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the transaction price, and
accordingly we recognize revenue based on the estimated amount to which we expect to be entitled
after considering expected returns. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and
updated at the end of each reporting period as additional information becomes available. We also may
provide credits or incentives on our products and services for contracts with resellers, which are
accounted for as variable consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize.
Wireline Contracts
Total consideration for wireline services that are bundled in a single contract is allocated to each
performance obligation based on our standalone selling price for each service. While many contracts
include one or more service performance obligations, the revenue recognition pattern is generally not
impacted by the allocation since the services are generally satisfied over the same period of time.
We estimate the standalone selling price to be the price of the services when sold on a standalone
basis without any promotional discount. In addition, we also assess whether the service term is
impacted by certain legally enforceable rights and obligations in our contract with customers such as
penalties that a customer would have to pay to early terminate a fixed-term contract. The assessment
of these legally enforceable rights and obligations involves judgment and impacts our determination
of transaction price and related disclosures.
We may provide performance-based credits or incentives on our products and services for contracts
with our Business customers, which are accounted for as variable consideration when estimating the
transaction price. Credits are estimated at contract inception and are updated at the end of each
reporting period as additional information becomes available.
Wireless and Wireline Contracts
For offers that include third-party providers, we evaluate whether we are acting as the principal or
as the agent with respect to the goods or services provided to the customer. This principal-versus-
agent assessment involves judgment and focuses on whether the facts and circumstances of the
arrangement indicate that the goods or services were controlled by us prior to transferring them to
the customer. To evaluate if we have control, we consider various factors including whether we are
primarily responsible for fulfillment, bear risk of loss and have discretion over pricing.
Other
Advertising revenues are generated through display advertising and search advertising. Display
advertising revenue is generated by the display of graphical advertisements and other performance-
based advertising. Search advertising revenue is generated when a consumer clicks on a text-based
advertisement on the search results page. The divested Verizon Media Group (Verizon Media), primarily
earned revenue through display advertising on Verizon Media properties, as well as on third-party
properties through our advertising platforms, search advertising, and subscription arrangements.
Revenue for display and search advertising contracts is recognized as ads are delivered, while
subscription contracts are recognized over time. We are generally the principal in transactions
carried out through our advertising platforms, and therefore report gross revenue based on the amount
billed to our customers. The control and transfer of digital advertising inventory occurs in a rapid,
real-time environment, where our proprietary technology enables us to identify, enhance, verify and
solely control digital advertising inventory that we then sell to our customers. Our control is
further supported by us being primarily responsible to our customers for fulfillment and the fact
that we can exercise a level of discretion over pricing. We completed the sale of Verizon Media on
September 1, 2021. See Note 3 for additional information on the sale of Verizon Media.
We offer telematics services including smart fleet management and optimization software. Telematics
service revenue is generated primarily through subscription contracts. We recognize revenue over time
for our subscription contracts.
We report taxes collected from customers on behalf of governmental authorities on revenue-producing
transactions on a net basis.
Maintenance and Repairs
We charge the cost of maintenance and repairs, including the cost of replacing minor items not
constituting substantial betterments, principally to Cost of services as these costs are incurred.
 60 
Table of Contents
Advertising Costs
Costs for advertising products and services, as well as other promotional and sponsorship costs, are
charged to Selling, general and administrative expense in the periods in which they are incurred.See
Note 15 for additional information.
Earnings Per Common Share
Basic earnings per common share are based on the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during
the period. Where appropriate, diluted earnings per common share include the dilutive effect of
shares issuable under our stock-based compensation plans.
There was a total of approximately 4.2million outstanding dilutive securities, primarily consisting
of performance stock units and restricted stock units, included in the computation of diluted
earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2023. There were a total of approximately
1.9million and 1.7million outstanding dilutive securities, primarily consisting of restricted stock
units, included in the computation of diluted earnings per common share for the years ended December
31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash
We consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of 90 days or less when purchased
to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates quoted market value
and includes amounts held in money market funds.
Cash collections on the receivables and on the underlying receivables related to the participation
interest collateralizing our asset-backed debt securities are required at certain specified times to
be placed into segregated accounts. Deposits to the segregated accounts are considered restricted
cash and are included in Prepaid expenses and other and Other assets in our consolidated balance
sheets.
Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash are included in the following line items in the
consolidated balance sheets:
 (dollars in millions) 
 At December 31, 2023 2022 Increase / (Decrease) 
 ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── 
 Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,065 $ 2,605 $ -540 
 Restricted cash: 
 Prepaid expenses and other 1,244 1,343 -99 
 Other assets 188 163 25 
 Cash, cash equivalents and 
 restricted $ 3,497 $ 4,111 $ -614 
 cash 
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities
Investments in equity securities that are not accounted for under equity method accounting or result
in consolidation are to be measured at fair value. For investments in equity securities without
readily determinable fair values, Verizon elects the measurement alternative permitted under GAAP to
measure these investments at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from
observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment of the same
issuer. For investments in debt securities without quoted prices, Verizon uses an alternative matrix
pricing method. Investments in equity securities that do not result in consolidation of the investee
are included in Investments in unconsolidated businesses and debt securities are included in Other
assets in our consolidated balance sheets.
Allowance for Credit Losses
Accounts receivable are recorded at amortized cost less an allowance for credit losses that are not
expected to be recovered. The gross amount of accounts receivable and corresponding allowance for
credit losses are presented separately in the consolidated balance sheets. We maintain allowances for
credit losses resulting from the expected failure or inability of our customers to make required
payments. We recognize the allowance for credit losses at inception and reassess quarterly based on
management’s expectation of the asset’s collectability. The allowance is based on multiple factors
including historical experience with bad debts, the credit quality of the customer base, the aging of
such receivables and current macroeconomic conditions, as well as management’s expectations of
conditions in the future, as applicable. Our allowance for credit losses is based on management’s
assessment of the collectability of assets pooled together with similar risk characteristics.
We pool our device payment plan agreement receivables based on the credit quality indicators and
shared risk characteristics of "new customers" and "existing customers." New customers are defined as
customers who have been with Verizon for less than 210days. Existing customers are defined as
customers who have been with Verizon for 210days or more. We record an allowance to reduce the
receivables to the amount that is expected to be collectible. For device payment plan agreement
receivables, we record bad debt expense based on a default and loss calculation using our proprietary
loss model. The expected loss rate is determined based on customer credit scores and other
qualitative factors as noted above. The loss rate is assigned
 61 
Table of Contents
individually on a customer by customer basis and the custom credit scores are then aggregated by
vintage and used in our proprietary loss model to calculate the weighted-average loss rate used for
determining the allowance balance.
We monitor the collectability of our wireless service receivables as one overall pool. Wireline
service receivables are disaggregated and pooled by the following customer groups: consumer, small
and medium business, enterprise, public sector and wholesale. For wireless service receivables and
wireline consumer and small and medium business receivables, the allowance is calculated based on a
12 month rolling average write-off balance multiplied by the average life-cycle of an account from
billing to write-off. The risk of loss is assessed over the contractual life of the receivables and
is adjusted based on the historical loss amounts for current and future conditions based on
management’s qualitative considerations. For enterprise, public sector and wholesale wireline
receivables, the allowance for credit losses is based on historical write-off experience and
individual customer credit risk, as applicable. We consider multiple factors in determining the
allowance as discussed above.
Inventories
Inventory consists of wireless and wireline equipment held for sale, which is carried at the lower of
cost (determined principally on either an average cost or first-in, first-out basis) or net
realizable value.
Property, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation
We record property, plant and equipment at cost. Property, plant and equipment are generally
depreciated on a straight-line basis.
Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated life of the improvement or the
remaining term of the related lease, calculated from the time the asset was placed in service.
When depreciable assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and accumulated
depreciation are deducted from the property, plant and equipment accounts and any gains or losses on
disposition are recognized in Selling, general and administrative expense.
We capitalize and depreciate network software purchased or developed within property, plant and
equipment assets. We also capitalize interest associated with the acquisition or construction of
network-related assets. Capitalized interest is reported as a reduction in interest expense and
depreciated as part of the cost of the network-related assets.
Computer Software and Cloud Computing Costs
We capitalize the cost of internal-use network and non-network software and defer the costs
associated with cloud computing arrangements that have a useful life and term in excess of one year.
Subsequent additions, modifications or upgrades to internal-use network and non-network software are
capitalized only to the extent that they add significant new functionality. Planning, software
maintenance and training costs for internal-use software and cloud computing arrangements are
expensed in the period in which they are incurred. We capitalize interest associated with the
development of internal-use network and non-network software. Capitalized non-network internal-use
software costs are amortized using the straight-line method over a period of 7years and are included
in Other intangible assets, net in our consolidated balance sheets. Costs incurred in implementing a
cloud computing arrangement are deferred during the application-development stage and recorded as
Prepaid expense and other in our consolidated balance sheets. Once a project is substantially
complete and ready for its intended use, we stop deferring the related cloud computing arrangement
costs.
For a discussion of our impairment policy for capitalized non-network software costs, see "Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets" below. See Note 4 for additional information of internal-use non-network
software reflected in our consolidated balance sheets. Similar to capitalized software costs,
deferred costs associated with cloud computing arrangements are subject to impairment testing.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Goodwill
Goodwill is the excess of the acquisition cost of businesses over the fair value of the identifiable
net assets acquired. Impairment testing for goodwill is performed annually in the fourth quarter or
more frequently if impairment indicators are present.
To determine if goodwill is potentially impaired, we have the option to perform a qualitative
assessment. However, we may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative
impairment test even if no indications of a potential impairment exist. It is our policy to perform
quantitative impairment assessment at least every three years.
Under the qualitative assessment, we consider several factors, including the business enterprise
value of the reporting unit from the last quantitative test and the excess of fair value over
carrying value from this test, macroeconomic conditions (including changes in interest rates and
discount rates), industry and market considerations (including industry revenue and earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) margin results, projections and recent merger
and acquisition activity), the recent and projected financial performance of the reporting unit, as
well as other factors.
 62 
Table of Contents
The quantitative impairment test for goodwill is performed at the reporting unit level and compares
the fair value of the reporting unit (calculated using a combination of a market approach and a
discounted cash flow method, as a form of the income approach) to its carrying value. Estimated fair
values of reporting units are Level 3 measures in the fair value hierarchy, see "Fair Value
Measurements" discussion below for additional information. The market approach includes the use of
comparative multiples of guideline companies to complement discounted cash flow results. The
discounted cash flow method is based on the present value of two components, projected cash flows and
a terminal value. The terminal value represents the expected normalized future cash flows of the
reporting unit beyond the cash flows from the discrete projection period. The fair value of the
reporting unit is calculated based on the sum of the present value of the cash flows from the
discrete period and the present value of the terminal value. The discount rate represents our
estimate of the weighted-average cost of capital, or expected return, that a marketplace participant
would have required as of the valuation date. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, an
impairment charge is booked for the excess carrying value over fair value, limited to the total
amount of goodwill of that reporting unit. During the fourth quarter each year, we update our five-
year strategic planning review for each of our reporting units. Those plans consider current economic
conditions and trends, estimated future operating results, our view of growth-rates and anticipated
future economic and regulatory conditions.
See Note 4 for additional information regarding our goodwill impairment testing.
Intangible Assets Not Subject to Amortization
A significant portion of our intangible assets are wireless licenses that provide our wireless
operations with the exclusive right to utilize designated radio frequency spectrum to provide
wireless communication services. While licenses are issued for only a fixed time, generally tento
fifteen years, such licenses are subject to renewal by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).
License renewals have occurred routinely and at nominal cost. Moreover, we have determined that there
are currently no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors that limit
the useful life of our wireless licenses. As a result, we treat the wireless licenses as an
indefinite-lived intangible asset. We re-evaluate the useful life determination for wireless licenses
each year to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful
life. We aggregate our wireless licenses into one single unit of accounting, as we utilize our
wireless licenses on an integrated basis as part of our nationwide wireless network.
We test our wireless licenses for potential impairment annually or more frequently if impairment
indicators are present. We have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine
whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. However, we may elect to bypass
the qualitative assessment in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative
impairment test. It is our policy to perform quantitative impairment assessment at least every three
years.
As part of our qualitative assessment we consider several factors including the business enterprise
value of our combined wireless business, macroeconomic conditions (including changes in interest
rates and discount rates), industry and market considerations (including industry revenue and EBITDA
margin results, projections and recent merger and acquisition activity), the recent and projected
financial performance of our combined wireless business as a whole, as well as other factors
including the result of our last quantitative assessment. See Note 4 for additional information
regarding our impairment tests.
Our quantitative impairment assessment consists of comparing the estimated fair value of our
aggregate wireless licenses to the aggregated carrying amount as of the test date. Under our
quantitative assessment, we estimate the fair value of our wireless licenses using the Greenfield
approach. The Greenfield approach is an income based valuation approach that values the wireless
licenses by calculating the cash flow generating potential of a hypothetical start-up company that
goes into business with no assets except the wireless licenses to be valued. A discounted cash flow
analysis is used to estimate what a marketplace participant would be willing to pay to purchase the
aggregated wireless licenses as of the valuation date. If the estimated fair value of the aggregated
wireless licenses is less than the aggregated carrying amount of the wireless licenses, then an
impairment charge is recognized.
Interest expense incurred while qualifying activities are performed to ready wireless licenses for
their intended use is capitalized as part of wireless licenses. The capitalization period ends when
the development is discontinued or substantially completed and the license is ready for its intended
use.
Wireless licenses can be purchased through public auctions conducted by the FCC. Deposits required to
participate in these auctions and purchase licenses are recorded within Other assets in our
consolidated balance sheets until the corresponding licenses are received and within Net cash used in
investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows.
Intangible Assets Subject to Amortization and Long-Lived Assets
Our intangible assets that do not have indefinite lives (primarily customer lists and non-network
internal-use software) are amortized over their estimated useful lives. All of our intangible assets
subject to amortization and other long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If
any indications of impairment are present, we would test for recoverability by comparing the carrying
amount of the asset group to the net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the asset
group. If those net undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying amount, we would perform the
next step, which is to determine the fair value of the asset
 63 
Table of Contents
and record an impairment, if any. We re-evaluate the useful life determinations for these intangible
assets each year to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to their remaining
useful lives.
See Note 4 for information related to the carrying amount of goodwill, wireless licenses and other
intangible assets, as well as the major components and average useful lives of our other acquired
intangible assets.
Leases
We lease network equipment including towers, distributed antenna systems, small cells, real estate,
connectivity mediums which include dark fiber, equipment, and other various types of assets for use
in our operations under both operating and finance leases. We assess whether an arrangement is a
lease or contains a lease at inception. For arrangements considered leases or that contain a lease
that is accounted for separately, we determine the classification and initial measurement of the
right-of-use asset and lease liability at the lease commencement date, which is the date that the
underlying asset becomes available for use.
For both operating and finance leases, we recognize a right-of-use asset, which represents our right
to use the underlying asset for the lease term, and a lease liability, which represents the present
value of our obligation to make payments arising over the lease term. The present value of the lease
payments is calculated using the incremental borrowing rate for operating and finance leases. The
incremental borrowing rate is determined using a portfolio approach based on the rate of interest
that the Company would have to pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a
collateralized basis over a similar term. Management uses the unsecured borrowing rate and risk-
adjusts that rate to approximate a collateralized rate, which is updated on a quarterly basis.
In those circumstances where Verizon is the lessee, we account for non-lease components associated
with our leases (e.g., common area maintenance costs) and lease components as a single lease
component for substantially all of our asset classes. Additionally, in arrangements where we are the
lessor, we have customer premise equipment for which we account for non-lease components (e.g.,
service revenue) and lease components as combined components under the revenue recognition guidance
in Topic 606 as the service revenues are the predominant components in the arrangements.
Rent expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease
and is included in either Cost of services or Selling, general and administrative expense in our
consolidated statements of income, based on the use of the facility or equipment on which rent is
being paid. Variable rent payments related to both operating and finance leases are expensed in the
period incurred. Our variable lease payments consist of payments dependent on various external
indicators, including real estate taxes, common area maintenance charges and utility usage.
Operating leases with a term of 12 months or less are not recorded in our consolidated balance
sheets; we recognize rent expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
We recognize the amortization of the right-of-use asset for our finance leases on a straight-line
basis over the shorter of the lease term or the useful life of the right-of-use asset in Depreciation
and amortization expense in our consolidated statements of income. The interest expense related to
finance leases is recognized using the effective interest method based on the discount rate
determined at lease commencement and is included within Interest expense in our consolidated
statements of income.
See Note 6 for additional information related to leases, including disclosure required under Topic
842.
Fair Value Measurements
Fair value of financial and non-financial assets and liabilities is defined as an exit price,
representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
orderly transaction between market participants. The three-tier hierarchy for inputs used in
measuring fair value, which prioritizes the inputs used in the methodologies of measuring fair value
for assets and liabilities, is as follows:
Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
Level 2 — Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and
liabilities
Level 3 — Unobservable pricing inputs in the market
Financial assets and financial liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level
of input that is significant to the fair value measurements. Our assessment of the significance of a
particular input to the fair value measurements requires judgment and may affect the valuation of the
assets and liabilities being measured and their categorization within the fair value hierarchy.
Income Taxes
Our effective tax rate is based on pre-tax income, statutory tax rates, tax laws and regulations and
tax planning strategies available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate.
 64 
Table of Contents
Deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences in the basis between financial statement
and income tax assets and liabilities. Deferred income taxes are recalculated annually at tax rates
in effect for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or
settled. We record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more
likely than not to be realized.
We use a two-step approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken
in a tax return. The first step is recognition: we determine whether it is more likely than not that
a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or
litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. In evaluating whether a tax
position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we presume that the position will be
examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. The
second step is measurement: a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold
is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax
position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being
realized upon ultimate settlement. Differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and
amounts recognized in the financial statements will generally result in one or more of the following:
an increase in a liability for income taxes payable, a reduction of an income tax refund receivable,
a reduction in a deferred tax asset or an increase in a deferred tax liability.
Significant management judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and in determining our
effective tax rate.
Stock-Based Compensation
We measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock-based compensation awards made to
employees and directors based on estimated fair values.See Note 10 for additional information.
Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions
The functional currency of our foreign operations is generally the local currency. For these foreign
entities, we translate their financial statements into U.S. dollars using average exchange rates for
the period for income statement amounts and using end-of-period exchange rates for assets and
liabilities. We record these translation adjustments in Accumulated other comprehensive loss, a
separate component of Equity, in our consolidated balance sheets. We record exchange gains and losses
resulting from the conversion of transaction currency to functional currency as a component of Other
income (expense), net.
Employee Benefit Plans
Pension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefits earned during the year, as well as
interest on projected benefit obligations, are accrued. Prior service costs and credits resulting
from changes in plan benefits are generally amortized over the average remaining service period of
the employees expected to receive benefits. Expected return on plan assets is determined by applying
the return on assets assumption to the actual fair value of plan assets. Actuarial gains and losses
are recognized in Other income (expense), net in the year in which they occur. These gains and losses
are measured annually as of December 31 and upon a remeasurement event. Verizon management employees
no longer earn pension benefits or earn service towards the Company retiree medical subsidy. See Note
11 for additional information.
We recognize a pension or a postretirement plan’s funded status as either an asset or liability in
the consolidated balance sheets. Also, we measure any unrecognized prior service costs and credits
that arise during the period as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of
applicable income tax.
Derivative Instruments
We enter into derivative transactions primarily to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign
currency exchange rates and interest rates. We employ risk management strategies, which may include
the use of a variety of derivatives including cross currency swaps, forward starting interest rate
swaps, interest rate swaps, treasury rate locks, interest rate caps, swaptions and foreign exchange
forwards. We do not hold derivatives for trading purposes.
We measure all derivatives at fair value and recognize them as either assets or liabilities in our
consolidated balance sheets. Our derivative instruments are valued primarily using models based on
readily observable market parameters for all substantial terms of our derivative contracts and thus
are classified as Level 2. Changes in the fair values of derivative instruments applied as economic
hedges are recognized in earnings in the current period. For fair value hedges, the change in the
fair value of the derivative instruments is recognized in earnings, along with the change in the fair
value of the hedged item. Unrealized gains or losses on excluded components of fair value hedges are
recorded in Other comprehensive income (loss) and are recognized into earnings on a systematic and
rational basis through the swap accrual over the life of the hedged item. For cash flow hedges, the
change in the fair value of the derivative instruments is reported in Other comprehensive income
(loss) and recognized in earnings when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. For net investment
hedges of certain of our foreign operations, the change in the fair value of the hedging instruments
is reported in Other comprehensive income (loss) as part of the cumulative translation adjustment and
partially offsets the impact of foreign currency changes on the value of our net investment.
Cash flows from derivatives, which are designated as accounting hedges or applied as economic hedges,
are presented consistently with the cash flow classification of the related hedged items. See Note 9
for additional information.

Variable Interest Entities
VIEs are entities that lack sufficient equity to permit the entity to finance its activities without
additional subordinated financial support from other parties, have equity investors that do not have
the ability to make significant decisions relating to the entity’s operations through voting rights,
do not have the obligation to absorb the expected losses, or do not have the right to receive the
residual returns of the entity. We consolidate the assets and liabilities of VIEs when we are deemed
to be the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary is the party that has the power to make the
decisions that most significantly affect the economic performance of the VIE and has the obligation
to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE.

 Note 2. Revenue and Contract Costs 
We earn revenue from contracts with customers, primarily through the provision of telecommunications
and other services and through the sale of wireless equipment.
Revenue by Category
We have tworeportable segments that we operate and manage as strategic business units, Consumer and
Business. Revenue is disaggregated by products and services within Consumer, and customer groups
(Enterprise and Public Sector, Business Markets and Other, and Wholesale) within Business. See Note
13 for additional information on revenue by segment, including Corporate and other.
We also earn revenues that are not accounted for under Topic 606 from leasing arrangements (such as
those for towers and equipment), captive reinsurance arrangements primarily related to wireless
device insurance and the interest recognized when equipment is sold to the customer by an authorized
agent under a device payment plan agreement. We have elected the practical expedient within Topic
842, to combine the lease and non-lease components for those customer arrangements under Topic 606
that involve customer premise equipment where we are the lessor. Revenues from arrangements that were
not accounted for under Topic 606 were approximately $ 2.9billion, $ 3.2billion and $ 3.1billion for
the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Remaining Performance Obligations
When allocating the total contract transaction price to identified performance obligations, a portion
of the total transaction price may relate to service performance obligations which were not satisfied
or are partially satisfied as of the end of the reporting period. Below we disclose information
relating to these unsatisfied performance obligations. We apply the practical expedient available
under Topic 606 that provides the option to exclude the expected revenues arising from unsatisfied
performance obligations related to contracts that have an original expected duration of one year or
less. This situation primarily arises with respect to certain month-to-month service contracts. At
December 31, 2023, month-to-month service contracts represented approximately 95% of our wireless
postpaid contracts and approximately 94% of our wireline Consumer and our Business Markets and Other
contracts, compared to December 31, 2022, for which month-to-month service contracts represented
approximately 94% of our wireless postpaid contracts and 92% of our wireline Consumer and our
Business Markets and Other contracts .
 66 
Table of Contents
Additionally, certain contracts provide customers the option to purchase additional services. The
fees related to these additional services are recognized when the customer exercises the option
(typically on a month-to-month basis).
Contracts for wireless services, with or without promotional credits that require maintenance of
service, are generally either month-to-month and cancellable at any time, or considered to contain
terms ranging from greater than one monthto up to thirty-six months(typically under a device payment
plan), or contain terms ranging from greater than one monthto up to twenty-four months(typically
under a fixed-term plan). Additionally, customers may incur charges based on usage or additional
optional services purchased in conjunction with entering into a contract that can be cancelled at any
time and therefore are not included in the transaction price. The transaction price allocated to
service performance obligations, which are not satisfied or are partially satisfied as of the end of
the reporting period, are generally related to contracts that are not accounted for as month-to-month
contracts.
Our Consumer group customers also include traditional wholesale resellers that purchase and resell
wireless service under their own brands to their respective customers. Reseller arrangements
generally include a stated contract term, which typically extends longer than two yearsand, in some
cases, include a periodic minimum revenue commitment over the contract term for which revenues will
be recognized in future periods.
Consumer customer contracts for wireline services are generally month-to-month; however, they may
have a service term of two yearsor shorter than twelve months. Certain contracts with Business
customers for wireline services extend into future periods, contain fixed monthly fees and usage-
based fees, and can include annual commitments in each year of the contract or commitments over the
entire specified contract term; however, a significant number of contracts for wireline services with
our Business customers have a contract term that is twelve monthsor less.
Additionally, there are certain contracts with Business customers for wireline services that have a
contractual minimum fee over the total contract term. We cannot predict the time period when revenue
will be recognized related to those contracts; thus, they are excluded from the time bands below.
These contracts have varying terms spanning over approximately thirty yearsending in September 2053
and have aggregate contract minimum payments totaling $ 2.1billion.
At December 31, 2023, the transaction price related to unsatisfied performance obligations that are
expected to be recognized for 2024, 2025 and thereafter was $ 25.7billion, $ 18.7billion and $
7.5billion, respectively. Remaining performance obligation estimates are subject to change and are
affected by several factors, including terminations and changes in the timing and scope of contracts,
arising from contract modifications.
Accounts Receivable and Contract Balances
The timing of revenue recognition may differ from the time of billing to our customers. Receivables
presented in our consolidated balance sheets represent an unconditional right to consideration.
Contract balances represent amounts from an arrangement when either Verizon has performed, by
transferring goods or services to the customer in advance of receiving all or partial consideration
for such goods and services from the customer, or the customer has made payment to Verizon in advance
of obtaining control of the goods and/or services promised to the customer in the contract.
The following table presents information about receivables from contracts with customers:
 At December 31, At December 31, 
 (dollars in millions) 2023 2022 
 ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── 
 Accounts Receivable(1) $ 9,760 $ 11,274 
 Device payment plan agreement 18,528 16,648 
 receivables(2) 
(1) Balances do not include receivables related to the following: activity associated with certain
vendor agreements, leasing arrangements (such as those for towers and equipment), captive reinsurance
arrangements primarily related to wireless device insurance and device payment plan agreement
receivables presented separately.
(2) Included in device payment plan agreement receivables presented in Note 8. Receivables derived
from the sale of equipment on a device payment plan through an authorized agent are excluded.
Contract assets primarily relate to our rights to consideration for goods or services provided to
customers but for which we do not have an unconditional right at the reporting date. Under a fixed-
term plan, total contract revenue is allocated between wireless service and equipment revenues. In
conjunction with these arrangements, a contract asset is created, which represents the difference
between the amount of equipment revenue recognized upon sale and the amount of consideration received
from the customer when the performance obligation related to the transfer of control of the equipment
is satisfied. The contract asset is reclassified to accounts receivable as wireless services are
provided and billed. We have the right to bill the customer as service is provided over time, which
results in our right to the payment being unconditional. The contract asset balances are presented in
our consolidated balance sheets as Prepaid expenses and other and Other assets. We recognize the
allowance for credit losses at inception and reassess quarterly based on management's expectation of
the asset's collectability.
Contract assets remained relatively flat during the year ended December 31, 2023.
 67 
Table of Contents
Contract liabilities arise when we bill our customers and receive consideration in advance of
providing the goods or services promised in the contract. We typically bill service one month in
advance, which is the primary component of the contract liability balance. Contract liabilities are
recognized as revenue when services are provided to the customer. The contract liability balances are
presented in our consolidated balance sheets as Other current liabilities and Other liabilities.
Contract liabilities increased $ 668million during the year ended December 31, 2023. The change in
contract liabilities was primarily due to increases in sales promotions recognized over time and
upfront fees.
Revenue recognized during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 related to contract liabilities
existing at January 1, 2023 and 2022 were $ 4.9billion and $ 5.0billion, respectively, as performance
obligations related to services were satisfied.
The balance of contract assets and contract liabilities recorded in our consolidated balance sheets
were as follows:
 (dollars in millions) At December 31, At December 31, 
 Assets 2023 2022 
 ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── 
 Prepaid expenses and other $ 546 $ 656 
 Other assets 268 207 
 Total Contract Assets $ 814 $ 863 
 Liabilities 
 Other current liabilities $ 6,955 $ 6,583 
 Other liabilities 1,947 1,651 
 Total Contract Liabilities $ 8,902 $ 8,234 
Contract Costs
As discussed in Note 1, Topic 606 requires the recognition of an asset for incremental costs to
obtain a customer contract, which are then amortized to expense over the respective periods of
expected benefit. We recognize an asset for incremental commission expenses paid to internal and
external sales personnel and agents in conjunction with obtaining customer contracts. We only defer
these costs when we have determined the commissions are incremental costs that would not have been
incurred absent the customer contract and are expected to be recoverable. Costs to obtain a contract
are amortized and recorded ratably as commission expense over the period representing the transfer of
goods or services to which the assets relate. Costs to obtain wireless contracts are amortized over
both of our Consumer and Business customers' estimated upgrade cycles, as such costs are typically
incurred each time a customer upgrades. Costs to obtain wireline contracts are amortized as expense
over the estimated customer relationship period for our Consumer customers. Incremental costs to
obtain wireline contracts for our Business customers are insignificant. Costs to obtain contracts are
recorded in Selling, general and administrative expense.
We also defer costs incurred to fulfill contracts that: (1) relate directly to the contract; (2) are
expected to generate resources that will be used to satisfy our performance obligation under the
contract; and (3) are expected to be recovered through revenue generated under the contract. Contract
fulfillment costs are expensed as we satisfy our performance obligations and recorded in Cost of
services. These costs principally relate to direct costs that enhance our wireline business
resources, such as costs incurred to install circuits.
We determine the amortization periods for our costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a customer contract
at a portfolio level due to the similarities within these customer contract portfolios.
Other costs, such as general costs or costs related to past performance obligations, are expensed as
incurred.
Collectively, costs to obtain a contract and costs to fulfill a contract are referred to as deferred
contract costs, and amortized over a one-to seven-yearperiod. Deferred contract costs are classified
as current or non-current within Prepaid expenses and other and Other assets, respectively.
The balances of deferred contract costs included in our consolidated balance sheets were as follows:
 (dollars in millions) At December 31, At December 31, 
 Assets 2023 2022 
 ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── 
 Prepaid expenses and other $ 2,756 $ 2,629 
 Other assets 2,639 2,475 
 Total $ 5,395 $ 5,104 
 68 
Table of Contents
For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we recognized expense of $ 3.2billion and $
3.0billion, respectively, associated with the amortization of deferred contract costs, primarily
within Selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of income.
We assess our deferred contract costs for impairment on a quarterly basis. We recognize an impairment
charge to the extent the carrying amount of a deferred cost exceeds the remaining amount of
consideration we expect to receive in exchange for the goods and services related to the cost, less
the expected costs related directly to providing those goods and services that have not yet been
recognized as expenses. There were insignificant impairment charges recognized for the year ended
December 31, 2023. There were noimpairment charges recognized for the year ended December 31, 2022.
 Note 3. Acquisitions and Divestitures 
Spectrum License Transactions
In February 2021, the FCC concluded Auction 107 for C-Band wireless spectrum. Verizon paid $
45.5billion for the licenses it won, of which $ 44.6billion was paid in the first quarter of 2021. In
accordance with the rules applicable to the auction, Verizon is required to make payments for our
allocable share of clearing costs incurred by, and incentive payments due to, the incumbent license
holders associated with the auction, which are estimated to be $ 7.6billion. During 2023 and 2022, we
made payments of $ 4.3billion and $ 1.6billion, respectively, for obligations related to clearing
costs and accelerated clearing incentives. During 2021, we made payments of $ 1.3billion primarily
related to certain obligations for clearing costs. We expect to continue to make payments of
approximately $ 400million for the remaining obligations through 2024. The final timing and amounts
of these payments could differ based on the actual amount of incumbent holders’ reimbursement claims
and the speed with which those claims are approved and processed. The carrying value of the wireless
spectrum won in Auction 107 consists of all payments required to participate and purchase licenses in
the auction, including Verizon’s allocable share of clearing costs incurred by, and incentive
payments due to, the incumbent license holders associated with the auction that we are obligated to
pay in order to acquire the licenses, as well as capitalized interest to the extent qualifying
activities have occurred.
In March 2022, Verizon signed agreements with satellite operators in which operators agreed to clear
C-Band spectrum in certain markets and frequencies ahead of the previously expected timeframe. During
2022, Verizon incurred costs associated with these agreements of approximately $ 340million, of which
$ 310million was paid as of December 31, 2022 and the remainder was paid in 2023. This early
clearance accelerated Verizon's access to more spectrum in a number of key markets to support its 5G
network initiatives.
Business Acquisitions and Divestitures
TracFone Wireless, Inc.
On November 23, 2021 (the Acquisition Date), we completed the acquisition of TracFone Wireless, Inc.
(TracFone). Verizon acquired all of TracFone's outstanding stock in exchange for approximately $
3.5billion in cash, net of cash acquired and working capital and other adjustments, 57,596,544shares
of common stock of the Company valued at approximately $ 3.0billion, and up to an additional $
650million in future cash contingent consideration related to the achievement of certain performance
measures and other commercial arrangements. The fair value of the common stock was determined on the
basis of its closing market price on the Acquisition Date. The estimated fair value of the contingent
consideration as of the Acquisition Date was approximately $ 560million and represents a Level 3
measurement as defined in ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. See Note 9 for additional
information. The contingent consideration payable is based on the achievement of certain revenue and
operational targets, measured over a two-yearearn out period. Contingent consideration payments were
completed in January of 2024.
During 2023 and 2022, Verizon made payments of $ 257million and $ 188million, respectively, related
to the contingent consideration, which is reflected in Cash flows from financing activities in our
consolidated statements of cash flows.
During 2022, Verizon received net cash proceeds of $ 248million for the final settlement of working
capital, which was included in our consideration as of the Acquisition Date.
Verizon Media Divestiture
On September 1, 2021, we completed the sale of Verizon Media. As of the close of the transaction,
cash proceeds, the fair value of the non-convertible preferred limited partnership units of an
affiliate of Apollo Global Management Inc. (the Apollo Affiliate) and the fair value of 10% of the
fully-diluted common limited partnership units of the Apollo Affiliate were $ 4.3billion, $
496million, and $ 124million, respectively. We recorded a pre-tax gain on sale of approximately $
1.0billion (after-tax $ 1.0billion) in Selling general and administrative expense in our consolidated
statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2021. In addition, we incurred $ 346million of
various costs associated with this disposition which are primarily recorded in Selling general and
administrative expense in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Under our ownership, Verizon Media generated revenues from contracts with customers under Topic 606
of approximately $ 5.3billion for the year ended December 31, 2021, reflected within our Corporate
and Other segment.

 Note 4. Wireless Licenses, Goodwill and Other 
 Intangible Assets 
Wireless Licenses
The carrying amounts of Wireless licenses are as follows:
 (dollars in millions) 
 At December 31, 2023 2022 
 ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── 
 Wireless licenses $ 155,667 $ 149,796 
During 2023 and 2022, we made payments of $ 4.3billion and $ 1.6billion, respectively, for
obligations related to clearing costs and accelerated clearing incentives for wireless licenses in
connection with Auction 107. During 2022, we made additional payments of $ 310million related to
accelerated clearing agreements for C-Band spectrum. See Note 3 for additional information.
At December 31, 2023 and 2022, approximately $ 15.0billion and $ 41.7billion, respectively, of
wireless licenses were under development for commercial service for which we were capitalizing
interest costs. We recorded approximately $ 1.4billion and $ 1.7billion of capitalized interest on
wireless licenses for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
During 2023 and 2022, we renewed various wireless licenses in accordance with FCC regulations with an
average renewal period of 10years and 15years, respectively. See Note 1 for additional information.
As discussed in Note 1, we test our wireless licenses for potential impairment annually or more
frequently if impairment indicators are present. In 2023 and 2022, we performed a qualitative
impairment assessment, which indicated it was more likely than not that the fair value of our
wireless licenses remained above their carrying amount and, therefore, did not result in an
impairment.
Our strategy requires significant capital investments primarily to acquire wireless spectrum, put the
spectrum into service, provide additional capacity for growth in our networks, invest in the fiber
that supports our businesses, evolve and maintain our networks and develop and maintain significant
advanced information technology systems and data system capabilities.

both Other and Total at December 31, 2022.
(4) Includes a goodwill impairment charge of $ 27million related to non-strategic businesses

(5) Goodwill balances are net of accumulated impairment charges of $ 5.8billion, $ 43million and $
5.9billion presented within Business, Other and Total, respectively, at December 31, 2023.
During the fourth quarter of 2023, we performed a qualitative impairment assessment for our Consumer
reporting unit. Our qualitative impairment assessment indicated that it was more likely than not that
the fair value of our Consumer reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and, therefore, did not
result in an impairment.
During the fourth quarter of 2023, we performed a quantitative impairment assessment for our Business
reporting unit given the low excess of fair value over carrying value identified in our prior annual
impairment assessment and increased competitive and market pressures experienced throughout 2023.
These pressures have resulted in lower projected cash flows primarily driven by secular declines in
wireline services and products across our Business customer groups. In connection with Verizon’s
annual budget process in the fourth quarter, leadership completed a comprehensive five-year strategic
planning review of our Business

Table of Contents
reporting unit resulting in declines in financial projections driven by market dynamics as compared
to the prior year five-year strategic planning cycle. The revised projections were used as a key
input into the Business reporting unit’s annual goodwill impairment test performed in the fourth
quarter. In addition, changes in the macroeconomic environment, including interest rate and
inflationary pressures have also impacted the fair value of the reporting unit.
We applied a combination of a market approach and a discounted cash flow method, as a form of the
income approach, reflecting current assumptions and inputs, including our revised projections,
discount rate and expected growth rates, which resulted in the determination that the fair value of
our Business reporting unit was less than its carrying amount. As a result, in the fourth quarter of
2023, we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of approximately $ 5.8billion ($ 5.8billion
after-tax) in our consolidated statement of income.
We performed a qualitative impairment assessment for our Consumer reporting unit in 2022. Our
qualitative assessment indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value of our Consumer
reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and, therefore, did not result in an impairment. We
performed a quantitative impairment assessment for our Business reporting unit in 2022. At the
goodwill impairment measurement date of October 31, 2022, our quantitative assessment indicated that
the fair value for our Business reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount and, therefore, did not
result in an impairment.

 Note 6. Leasing Arrangements 
We enter into various lease arrangements for network equipment including towers, distributed antenna
systems, small cells, real estate and connectivity mediums including dark fiber, equipment, and other
various types of assets for use in our operations. Our leases have remaining lease terms ranging from
1year to 30years, some of which include options that we can elect to extend the leases term for up to
25years, and some of which include options to terminate the leases. For the majority of leases
entered into during the current period, we have concluded it is not reasonably certain that we would
exercise the options to extend the lease or not terminate the lease. Therefore, as of the lease
commencement date, our lease terms generally do not include these options. We include options to
extend the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option.
During March 2015, we completed a transaction with American Tower Corporation (American Tower)
pursuant to which American Tower acquired the exclusive rights to lease and operate approximately
11,300of our wireless towers for an upfront payment of $ 5.0billion. We have subleased capacity on
the towers from American Tower for a minimum of 10years at current market rates in 2015, with options
to renew. We continue to include the towers in Property, plant and equipment, net in our consolidated
balance sheets and depreciate them accordingly. In addition to the rights to lease and operate the
towers, American Tower assumed the interest in the underlying ground leases related to these towers.
While American Tower can renegotiate the terms of and is responsible for paying the ground leases, we
are still the primary obligor for these leases and accordingly, the present value of these ground
leases are included in our operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities. We do
not expect to be required to make ground lease payments unless American Tower defaults, which we
determined to be remote.

During 2023, we received $ 8.6billion of proceeds from long-term borrowings, which included $
6.6billion of proceeds from asset-backed debt transactions. The net proceeds were primarily used for
general corporate purposes including the repayment of debt and the funding of certain renewable
energy projects. We used $ 10.6billion of cash to repay and repurchase long-term borrowings and
finance lease obligations, including $ 4.4billion to prepay and repay asset-backed, long-term
borrowings. The net proceeds of approximately $ 1.0billion from the notes issued in 2023 are expected
to be used to fund certain renewable energy projects.
During 2022, we received $ 17.8billion of proceeds from long-term borrowings, which included $

Short-Term Borrowing and Commercial Paper Program
In March 2023, we entered into and fully drew from a $ 500million short-term revolving credit
facility. In July 2023, the short-term revolving credit facility matured and was fully repaid. As of
December 31, 2023, we had noshort-term borrowing outstanding.
In 2023, we issued $ 15.9billion in commercial paper and we repaid $ 16.1billion of commercial paper.
As of December 31, 2023, we had nocommercial paper outstanding. These transactions are reflected
within Cash flows from financing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows on a net
basis.
Asset-Backed Debt
As of December 31, 2023, the carrying value of our asset-backed debt was $ 22.2billion. Our asset-
backed debt includes Asset-Backed Notes (ABS Notes) issued to third-party investors (Investors) and
loans (ABS Financing Facilities) received from banks and their conduit facilities (collectively, the
Banks). Our consolidated asset-backed debt bankruptcy remote legal entities (each, an ABS Entity, or
collectively, the ABS Entities) issue the debt or are otherwise party to the transaction
documentation in connection with our asset-backed debt transactions. Under the terms of our asset-
backed debt, Cellco Partnership (Cellco), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and certain other
Company affiliates (collectively, the Originators) transfer device payment plan agreement receivables
and certain other receivables (collectively referred to as certain receivables) or a participation
interest in certain other receivables to one of the ABS Entities, which in turn transfers such
receivables and participation interest to another ABS Entity that issues the debt. Verizon entities
retain the equity interests and residual interests, as applicable, in the ABS Entities, which
represent the rights to all funds not needed to make required payments on the asset-backed debt and
other related payments and expenses.
 75 
Table of Contents
Our asset-backed debt is secured by the transferred receivables and participation interest, and
future collections on such receivables and underlying receivables related to such participation
interest. These receivables and participation interest transferred to the ABS Entities and related
assets, consisting primarily of restricted cash, will only be available for payment of asset-backed
debt and expenses related thereto, payments to the Originators in respect of additional transfers of
certain receivables and participation interest, and other obligations arising from our asset-backed
debt transactions, and will not be available to pay other obligations or claims of Verizon’s
creditors until the associated asset-backed debt and other obligations are satisfied. The Investors
or Banks, as applicable, which hold our asset-backed debt have legal recourse to the assets securing
the debt, but do not have any recourse to Verizon with respect to the payment of principal and
interest on the debt. Under a parent support agreement, the Company has agreed to guarantee certain
of the payment obligations of Cellco and the Originators to the ABS Entities.
Cash collections on the receivables and on the underlying receivables related to the participation
interest collateralizing our asset-backed debt securities are required at certain specified times to
be placed into segregated accounts. Deposits to the segregated accounts are considered restricted
cash and are included in Prepaid expenses and other and Other assets in our consolidated balance
sheets.
Proceeds from our asset-backed debt transactions are reflected in Cash flows from financing
activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. The asset-backed debt issued is included in
Debt maturing within one year and Long-term debt in our consolidated balance sheets.

Under the terms of each series of ABS Notes outstanding as of December 31, 2023, there is a revolving
period of up to 18months, two years, three years, or five years, as applicable, during which we may
transfer additional receivables to the ABS

Table of Contents
Entity. During the year ended December 31, 2023 , we made aggregate principal repayments of $
3.7billion in connection with anticipated redemptions of ABS Notes and notes that have entered the
amortization period, including payments in connection with any note redemptions. During the year
ended December 31, 2022 , we made aggregate principal repayments of $ 4.3billion in connection with
ABS Notes that have entered the amortization period, including payments in connection with any note
redemptions.
In January 2024, we issued $ 1.9billion aggregate principal amount of twoseries of senior and junior
ABS Notes, with a blended interest rate of approximately 4.867% and 5.028%, through an ABS Entity. In
addition, in connection with an anticipated redemption of ABS Notes, we made a principal repayment,
in whole, for $ 408million.
ABS Financing Facilities
Under the twoloan agreements outstanding in connection with the ABS Financing Facility originally
entered into in December 2021 and previously renewed in 2022 (2021 ABS Financing Facility), we
borrowed an additional $ 325million in March 2023 and prepaid an aggregate of $ 700million in April
2023. In December 2023, we renewed the loan agreements in connection with the 2021 ABS Financing
Facility which reset the revolving periods by 18months, and we borrowed an additional $ 925million.
The aggregate outstanding balance under the 2021 ABS Financing Facility was $ 8.5billion as of
December 31, 2023. In January 2024, we prepaid an aggregate of $ 900million under the loan agreements
outstanding in connection with the 2021 ABS Financing Facility.
In March 2023, we borrowed an additional $ 500million under the loan agreement outstanding in
connection with the ABS Financing Facility that we originally entered into in 2022 (2022 ABS
Financing Facility). In December 2023, we renewed the loan agreement in connection with the 2022 ABS
Financing Facility which reset the revolving period by one year, and we borrowed an additional $
450million. T he aggregate outstanding balance under the 2022 ABS Financing Facility was $ 3.0billion
as of December 31, 2023 .
Variable Interest Entities
The ABS Entities meet the definition of a VIE for which we have determined that we are the primary
beneficiary as we have both the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly
impact the entity’s performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits
of the entity. Therefore, the assets, liabilities and activities of the ABS Entities are consolidated
in our financial results and are included in amounts presented on the face of our consolidated
balance sheets.
The assets and liabilities related to our asset-backed debt arrangements included in our consolidated
balance sheets were as follows:

(1) The revolving credit facility does not require us to comply with financial covenants or maintain
specified credit ratings, and it permits us to borrow even if our business has incurred a material
adverse change. The revolving credit facility provides for the issuance of letters of credit. As of
December 31, 2023, there have been nodrawings against the $ 9.5billion revolving credit facility
since its inception.
(2) During 2023 and 2022, we drew down $ 1.0billion and $ 3.0billion, respectively, from these
facilities. Borrowings under certain of these facilities are amortized semi-annually in equal
installments up to the applicable maturity dates. Maturities reflect maturity dates of principal
amounts outstanding. Any amounts borrowed under these facilities and subsequently repaid cannot be
reborrowed.
Non-Cash Transactions
During the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we financed, primarily through alternative
financing arrangements, the purchase of approximately $ 1.3billion, $ 832million, and $ 461million,
respectively, of long-lived assets consisting primarily of network equipment. As of December 31, 2023
and 2022, $ 2.2billion and $ 1.7billion, respectively, relating to these financing arrangements,
including those entered into in prior years and liabilities assumed through acquisitions, remained
outstanding. These purchases are non-cash financing activities and therefore are not reflected within
Capital expenditures in our consolidated statements of cash flows.
Net Debt Extinguishment Gains (Losses)
During the year ended December 31, 2023 , we recorded net debt extinguishment gains of $ 308million.
During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recorded net debt extinguishment losses of $
1.1billion and $ 3.6billion, respectively. The net gains and losses are recorded in Other income
(expense), net in our consolidated statements of income. The total gains and losses are reflected
within Other, net cash flow from operating activities, and the portion of the gains and losses
representing cash payments are reflected within Other, net cash flow from financing activities in our
consolidated statements of cash flows.
Guarantees
We guarantee the debentures of our operating telephone company subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2023,
$ 614million aggregate principal amount of these obligations remained outstanding. Each guarantee
will remain in place for the life of the obligation unless terminated pursuant to its terms,
including the operating telephone company no longer being a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.
Debt Covenants
We and our consolidated subsidiaries are in compliance with all of our restrictive covenants in our
debt agreements.

Included in Other assets and Accounts receivable, net at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 are
net device payment plan agreement receivables and net wireless service receivables of $ 26.1billion
and $ 23.6billion, respectively, which have been transferred to ABS Entities and continue to be
reported in our consolidated balance sheets. Included in Accounts receivable, net at December 31,
2023 are net other receivables of $ 911million, on which a participation interest has been
transferred to ABS Entities and continue to be reported in our consolidated balance sheet. See Note 7
for additional information. We believe the carrying value of these receivables approximate their fair
value using a Level 3 expected cash flow model.

Table of Contents
Under the Verizon device payment program, our eligible wireless customers purchase wireless devices
under a device payment plan agreement. Customers that activate service on devices purchased under the
device payment program pay lower service fees as compared to those under our fixed-term service
plans, and their device payment plan charge is included on their wireless monthly bill. We no longer
offer Consumer customers new fixed-term, subsidized service plans for devices; however, we continue
to offer subsidized plans to our Business customers. We also continue to service existing plans for
customers who have not yet purchased and activated devices under the Verizon device payment program.

(1) Includes allowance for both short-term and long-term device payment plan agreement receivables.
For indirect channel wireless contracts with customers, we impute risk adjusted interest on the
device payment plan agreement receivables. We record the imputed interest as a reduction to the
related accounts receivable. The associated interest income, which is included within Service
revenues and other in our consolidated statements of income, is recognized over the financed device
payment term.
Promotions
In connection with certain device payment plan agreements, we may offer a promotion to allow our
customers to upgrade to a new device after paying down a certain specified portion of the required
device payment plan agreement amount as well as trading in their device in good working order. When a
customer enters into a device payment plan agreement with the right to upgrade to a new device, we
account for this trade-in right as a guarantee obligation. We recognize a liability measured at fair
value for the customer’s right to trade in the device which is determined by considering several
factors, including the weighted-average selling prices obtained in recent resales of similar devices
eligible for trade-in. At December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the amount of the guarantee
liability was insignificant and $ 54million, respectively.
We may offer certain promotions that allow a customer to trade in their owned device in connection
with the purchase of a new device. Under these types of promotions, the customer receives a credit
for the value of the trade-in device. At December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the amount of
trade-in liability was $ 566million and $ 562million, respectively.
In addition, we may provide the customer with additional future billing credits that will be applied
against the customer’s monthly bill as long as service is maintained. These future billing credits
are accounted for as consideration payable to a customer and are included in the determination of
total transaction price, resulting in a contract liability.
Device payment plan agreement receivables, net, disclosed in the table above, does not reflect the
trade-in liability, additional future credits or the guarantee liability.
Origination of Device Payment Plan Agreements
When originating device payment plan agreements, we use internal and external data sources to create
a credit risk score to measure the credit quality of a customer and to determine eligibility for the
device payment program. Verizon’s experience has been that the payment attributes of longer tenured
customers are highly predictive for estimating their reliability to make future payments. Customers
with longer tenures tend to exhibit similar risk characteristics to other customers with longer
tenures, and receivables due from customers with longer tenures tend to perform better than
receivables from customers that have not previously been Verizon customers. As a result of this
experience, we make initial lending decisions based upon whether the customers are "established
customers" or "short-tenured customers." If a Consumer customer has been a customer for 45days or
more, or if a Business customer has been a customer for 12months or more, the customer is considered
an "established customer." For established customers, the credit decision and ongoing credit
monitoring processes rely on a combination of internal and external data sources. If a Consumer
customer has been a customer less than 45days, or a Business customer has
 80 
Table of Contents
been a customer for less than 12months, the customer is considered a "short-tenured customer." For
short-tenured customers, the credit decision and credit monitoring processes rely more heavily on
external data sources.
Available external credit data from credit reporting agencies along with internal data are used to
create custom credit risk scores for Consumer customers. The custom credit risk score is generated
automatically from the applicant’s credit data using proprietary custom credit models. The credit
risk score measures the likelihood that the potential customer will become severely delinquent and be
disconnected for non-payment. For a small portion of short-tenured customer applications, a
traditional credit report is not available from one of the national credit reporting agencies because
the potential customer does not have sufficient credit history. In those instances, alternative
credit data is used for the risk assessment. For Business customers, we also verify the existence of
the business with external data sources.
Based on the custom credit risk score, we assign each customer a credit class, each of which has
specified offers of credit. This includes an account level spending limit and a maximum amount of
credit allowed per device for Consumer customers or a required down payment percentage for Business
customers.
Credit Quality Information
Subsequent to origination, we assess indicators for the quality of our wireless device payment plan
agreement portfolio using two models, one for new customers and one for existing customers. The model
for new customers pools all Consumer and Business wireless customers based on less than 210days as
"new customers." The model for existing customers pools all Consumer and Business wireless customers
based on 210days or more as "existing customers."

The data presented in the table above was last updated on December 31, 2023.
Allowance for Credit Losses
The credit quality indicators are used in determining the estimated amount and the timing of expected
credit losses for the device payment plan agreement and wireless service receivables portfolios.
For device payment plan agreement receivables, we record bad debt expense based on a default and loss
calculation using our proprietary loss model. The expected loss rate is determined based on customer
credit scores and other qualitative factors as noted above. The loss rate is assigned individually on
a customer by customer basis and the custom credit scores are then aggregated by vintage and used in
our proprietary loss model to calculate the weighted-average loss rate used for determining the
allowance balance.
We monitor the collectability of our wireless service receivables as one overall pool. Wireline
service receivables are disaggregated and pooled by the following types of customers and related
contracts: consumer, small and medium business,
 81 
Table of Contents
enterprise, public sector and wholesale. For wireless service receivables and wireline consumer and
small and medium business receivables, the allowance is calculated based on a 12 month rolling
average write-off balance multiplied by the average life-cycle of an account from billing to write-
off. The risk of loss is assessed over the contractual life of the receivables and is adjusted based
on the historical loss amounts for current and future conditions based on management’s qualitative
considerations. For enterprise, public sector and wholesale wireline receivables, the allowance for
credit losses is based on historical write-off experience and individual customer credit risk, if
applicable.
Activity in the allowance for credit losses by portfolio segment of receivables was as follows:

(1) Includes allowance for both short-term and long-term device payment plan agreement receivables.
We monitor delinquency and write-off experience based on the quality of our device payment plan
agreement and wireless service receivables portfolios. The extent of our collection efforts with
respect to a particular customer are based on the results of our proprietary custom internal scoring
models that analyze the customer’s past performance to predict the likelihood of the customer falling
further delinquent. These custom scoring models assess a number of variables, including origination
characteristics, customer account history and payment patterns. Since our customers’ behaviors may be
impacted by general economic conditions, we analyzed whether changes in macroeconomic conditions
impact our credit loss experience and have concluded that our credit loss estimates are generally not
materially impacted by reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions. Based on
the score derived from these models, accounts are grouped by risk category to determine the
collection strategy to be applied to such accounts. For device payment plan agreement receivables and
wireless service receivables, we consider an account to be delinquent and in default status if there
are unpaid charges remaining on the account on the day after the bill’s due date. The risk class
determines the speed and severity of the collections effort including initiatives taken to facilitate
customer payment.

Certain of our equity investments do not have readily determinable fair values and are excluded from
the tables above. Such investments are measured at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus changes
resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar
investment of the same issuer and are included in Investments in unconsolidated businesses in our
consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the carrying amount of
our investments without readily determinable fair values was $ 764million and $ 804million,
respectively. During 2023, there were insignificant adjustments due to observable price changes and
insignificant impairment charges. Cumulative adjustments due to observable price changes and
impairment charges were approximately $ 209million and $ 98million, respectively.
Verizon has a liability for contingent consideration related to its acquisition of TracFone,
completed in November 2021. The fair value is calculated using a probability-weighted discounted cash
flow model and represents a Level 3 measurement. Level 3 instruments include valuation based on
unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions
made by other market participants. Subsequent to the Acquisition Date, at each reporting date, the
contingent consideration liability is remeasured to fair value. During 2023 and 2022, we made
payments of $ 257million and $ 188million, respectively, related to the contingent consideration. The
payments were completed in January of 2024. See Note 3 for additional information.
Fixed income securities consist primarily of investments in municipal bonds. The valuation of the
fixed income securities is based on the quoted prices for similar assets in active markets or
identical assets in inactive markets or models that apply inputs from observable market data. The
valuation determines that these securities are classified as Level 2.
Derivative contracts are valued using models based on readily observable market parameters for all
substantial terms of our derivative contracts and thus are classified within Level 2. We use mid-
market pricing for fair value measurements of our derivative instruments. Our derivative instruments
are recorded on a gross basis.
We recognize transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end of the reporting
period.

Derivative Instruments
We enter into derivative transactions primarily to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign
currency exchange rates and interest rates. We employ risk management strategies, which may include
the use of a variety of derivatives including interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps, forward
starting interest rate swaps, treasury rate locks, interest rate caps, swaptions and foreign exchange
forwards. We do not hold derivatives for trading purposes.

Interest Rate Swaps
We enter into interest rate swaps to achieve a targeted mix of fixed and variable rate debt. We
principally receive fixed rates and pay variable rates, resulting in a net increase or decrease to
Interest expense. These swaps are designated as fair value hedges and hedge against interest rate
risk exposure of designated debt issuances. We record the interest rate swaps at fair value in our
consolidated balance sheets as assets and liabilities. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate
swaps are recorded to Interest expense, which are primarily offset by changes in the fair value of
the hedged debt due to changes in interest rates.
Cross Currency Swaps
We have entered into cross currency swaps previously designated as cash flow hedges through March 31,
2022 to exchange our British Pound Sterling, Euro, Swiss Franc, Canadian Dollar and Australian
Dollar-denominated cash flows into U.S. dollars and to fix our cash payments in U.S. dollars, as well
as to mitigate the impact of foreign currency transaction gains or losses. A portion of the loss
recognized in Other comprehensive income (loss) was reclassified to Interest expense to offset the
related pre-tax foreign currency transaction gain or loss on the underlying hedged item.
On March 31, 2022, we elected to de-designate our cross currency swaps as cash flow hedges and re-
designated these swaps as fair value hedges. For these hedges, we have elected to exclude the change
in fair value of the cross currency swaps related to both time value and cross currency basis spread
from the assessment of hedge effectiveness (the excluded components). The initial value of the
excluded components of $ 1.0billion as of March 31, 2022 will continue to be amortized into Interest
expense over the remaining life of the hedging instruments. We estimate that $ 104million will be
amortized into Interest expense within the next 12 months.
In addition to the previously mentioned cross currency swaps, we have executed additional cross
currency swaps to exchange Euro-denominated cash flows into U.S. dollars to fix our cash payments in
U.S. dollars. These swaps are designated as fair value hedges. We record the cross currency swaps at
fair value in our consolidated balance sheets as assets and liabilities. Changes in the fair value of
the cross currency swaps attributable to changes in the spot rate of the hedged item and changes in
the recorded value of the hedged debt due to changes in spot rates are recorded in the same income
statement line item. We present exchange gains and losses from the conversion of foreign currency
denominated debt as a part of Interest expense. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022,
these amounts completely offset each other and no net gain or loss was recorded.
Changes in the fair value of cross currency swaps attributable to time value and cross currency basis
spread are initially recorded to Other comprehensive income (loss). Unrealized gains or losses on
excluded components are recorded in Other comprehensive income (loss) and are recognized into
Interest expense on a systematic and rational basis through the swap accrual over the life of the
hedging instrument. The amount remaining in Accumulated other comprehensive loss related to cash flow
hedges on the date of transition will be reclassified to earnings when the hedged item is recognized
in earnings or when it becomes probable that the forecasted transactions will not occur. During the
years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the amortization of the initial value of the excluded
component completely offset the amortization related to the amount remaining in Other comprehensive
income (loss) related to cash flow hedges. See Note 14 for additional information.

Forward Starting Interest Rate Swaps
From time to time we enter into forward starting interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges
in order to manage our exposure to interest rate changes on future forecasted transactions . We hedge
our exposure to the variability in future cash flows based on the expected maturities of the related
forecasted debt issuance. We recognize gains and losses resulting from interest rate movements in
Other comprehensive income (loss).
Treasury Rate Locks
We have entered into treasury rate locks designated as cash flow hedges to mitigate our interest rate
risk on future transactions. We recognize gains and losses resulting from interest rate movements in
Other comprehensive income (loss).
Net Investment Hedges
We have designated certain foreign currency debt instruments as net investment hedges to mitigate
foreign exchange exposure related to non-U.S. dollar net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries
against changes in foreign exchange rates. The notional amount of Euro-denominated debt designated as
a net investment hedge was € 750million as of both December 31, 2023 and 2022.
Undesignated Derivatives
We also have the following derivative contracts which we use as economic hedges but for which we have
elected not to apply hedge accounting.

Swaptions
We enter into swaptions to achieve a targeted mix of fixed and variable rate debt.
Concentrations of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of temporary
cash investments, short-term and long-term investments, trade receivables, including device payment
plan agreement receivables, certain notes receivable, including lease receivables, and derivative
contracts.
Counterparties to our derivative contracts are major financial institutions with whom we have
negotiated derivatives agreements (ISDA master agreements) and credit support annex (CSA) agreements
which provide rules for collateral exchange. The CSA agreements contain fixed cap amounts or rating
based thresholds such that we or our counterparties may be required to hold or post collateral based
upon changes in outstanding positions as compared to established thresholds or caps and changes in
credit ratings. We do not offset fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments and fair
value amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral or the obligation to return cash
collateral arising from derivative instruments recognized at fair value. At both December 31, 2023
and 2022, we did not hold any collateral. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, we posted $ 1.4billion and $
2.3billion, respectively, of collateral related to derivative contracts under collateral exchange
agreements, which were recorded as Prepaid expenses and other in our consolidated balance sheets.
While we may be exposed to credit losses due to the nonperformance of our counterparties, we consider
the risk remote and do not expect that any such nonperformance would result in a significant effect
on our results of operations or financial condition due to our diversified pool of counterparties.

 Note 10. Stock-Based Compensation 
Verizon Long-Term Incentive Plan
In May 2017, our shareholders approved the 2017 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the 2017 Plan) and
terminated the Company's authority to grant new awards under the Verizon 2009 Long-Term Incentive
Plan (the 2009 Plan). The 2017 Plan provides for broad-based equity grants to employees, including
executive officers, and permits the granting of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted
stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance stock units and other awards. Upon
approval of the 2017 Plan, we reserved for issuance under the 2017 Plan the number of shares that
were remaining but not issued under the 2009 Plan. Shares subject to outstanding awards under the
2009 Plan that expire, are canceled or otherwise terminated will also be available for awards under
the 2017 Plan. As of December 31, 2023, 57million shares are reserved for future issuance under the
2017 Plan.
Restricted Stock Units
Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) granted under the 2017 Plan generally vest in threeequal installments
on each anniversary of the grant date. The RSUs that are paid in stock upon vesting and are thus
classified as equity awards are measured using the grant date fair value of Verizon common stock and
are not remeasured at the end of each reporting period. In 2020, Verizon announced a broad-based
program that provides for the annual award of cash-settled RSUs under the 2017 Plan to all full-time
and part-time employees who meet eligibility requirements. The RSUs that are settled in cash are
classified as liability awards and the liability is measured at its fair value at the end of each
reporting period. All RSUs granted under the 2017 Plan have dividend equivalent units (DEUs), which
will be paid to participants if, and only to the extent the applicable RSU award vests, and is paid
at the time the RSU award is paid, and in the same proportion as the RSU award.
We estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if
actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. We use historical data to estimate forfeitures and
recognize that estimated compensation cost of restricted stock units, net of estimated forfeitures,
on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
Performance Stock Units
The 2017 Plan also provides for grants of Performance Stock Units (PSUs) that generally vest at the
end of the third year after the grant. As defined by the 2017 Plan, the Human Resources Committee of
the Board of Directors determines the number of PSUs a participant earns based on the extent to which
the corresponding performance goals have been achieved over the three-yearperformance cycle. The PSUs
that are paid in stock upon vesting and are classified as equity awards are measured using the grant
date fair value of Verizon common stock and are not remeasured at the end of each reporting period.
The PSUs that are settled in cash and are classified as liability awards are measured at its fair
value at the end of each reporting period and, therefore, will fluctuate based on the price of
Verizon common stock as well as performance relative to the targets. All PSUs granted under the 2017
Plan have DEUs, which will be paid to participants if, and only to the extent the applicable PSU
award vests, and is paid at the time that PSU award is paid, and in the same proportion as the PSU
award. The granted and cancelled activity for the PSU award includes adjustments for the performance
goals achieved.

As of December 31, 2023, unrecognized compensation expense related to the unvested portion of
Verizon’s RSUs and PSUs was approximately $ 719million and is expected to be recognized over
approximately 2years.
The equity awards granted in 2023, 2022 and 2021 have weighted-average grant date fair values of $
37.53, $ 53.26and $ 55.39per unit, respectively. During 2023, 2022 and 2021, we paid $ 415million, $
433million and $ 986million, respectively, to settle RSUs and PSUs classified as liability awards.

 Note 11. Employee Benefits 
We maintain non-contributory defined benefit pension plans for certain employees. In addition, we
maintain postretirement health care and life insurance plans for certain retirees and their
dependents, which are both contributory and non-contributory, and include a limit on our share of the
cost for certain current and future retirees. In accordance with our accounting policy for pension
and other postretirement benefits, operating expenses include service costs associated with pension
and other postretirement benefits while other credits and/or charges based on actuarial assumptions,
including projected discount rates, an estimated return on plan assets, and impact from health care
trend rates are reported in Other income (expense), net. These estimates are updated in the fourth
quarter or upon a remeasurement event, to reflect actual return on plan assets and updated actuarial
assumptions. The adjustment is recognized in the income statement during the fourth quarter and upon
a remeasurement event pursuant to our accounting policy for the recognition of actuarial gains and
losses.
Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits
Pension and other postretirement benefits for certain employees are subject to collective bargaining
agreements. Modifications in benefits have been bargained from time to time, and we may also
periodically amend the benefits in the management plans. The following tables summarize benefit
costs, as well as the benefit obligations, plan assets, funded status and rate assumptions associated
with pension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans.

The accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans was $ 15.1billion and $
15.3billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Actuarial (Gain) Loss, Net
The net actuarial loss in 2023 is primarily the result of a $ 534million loss in our postretirement
benefit plans due to an increase in our healthcare cost trend rate assumption used to determine the
current year liabilities of our postretirement benefit plans from a weighted-average of 6.6% at
December 31, 2022 to a weighted-average of 7.3% at December 31, 2023; and a $ 503million loss ($
288million in our pension plans and $ 215million in our postretirement benefit plans) due to a
decrease in our discount rate assumption used to determine the current year liabilities of our
pension plans and postretirement benefit plans from a weighted-average of 5.2% at December 31, 2022
to a weighted-average of 5.0% at December 31, 2023.
The net actuarial gain in 2022 is primarily the result of a $ 7.0billion gain ($ 4.1billion gain in
our pension plans and $ 2.9billion gain in our postretirement benefit plans) due to an increase in
our discount rate assumption used to determine the current year liabilities of our pension plans and
postretirement benefit plans from a weighted-average of 2.9% at December 31, 2021 to a weighted-
average of 5.2% at December 31, 2022.
Plan Amendments
The reclassifications from the amounts recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a
result of collective bargaining agreements and plan amendments made in 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2022
resulted in a net decrease to net periodic benefit cost and net increase to pre-tax income of
approximately $ 252million, $ 390million and $ 708million during 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

In determining our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, we used a weighted-average
discount rate of 5.0% in 2023. The rates were selected to approximate the composite interest rates
available on a selection of high-quality bonds available in the market at December 31, 2023. The
bonds selected had maturities that coincided with the time periods during which benefits payments are
expected to occur, were non-callable (or callable with certain selection criteria met) and available
in sufficient quantities to ensure marketability (at least $ 300million par outstanding).
In order to project the long-term target investment return for the total portfolio, estimates are
prepared for the total return of each major asset class over the subsequent 10-yearperiod. Those
estimates are based on a combination of factors including the current market interest rates and
valuation levels, consensus earnings expectations and historical long-term risk premiums. To
determine the aggregate return for the pension trust, the projected return of each individual asset
class is then weighted according to the allocation to that investment area in the trust’s long-term
asset allocation policy.
The assumed health care cost trend rates are as follows:
 Health Care and Life 
 At December 31, 2023 2022 2021 
 ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── 
 Weighted-average healthcare cost trend 7.30 % 6.60 % 6.20 % 
 rate assumed for next year 
 Rate to which cost trend rate gradually 4.50 4.50 4.50 
 declines 
 Year the rate reaches the level it is 2032 2031 2029 
 assumed to remain thereafter 
Plan Assets
The Company’s overall investment strategy is to achieve a mix of assets that allows us to meet
projected benefit payments while taking into consideration risk and return. While target allocation
percentages will vary over time, the current target allocation for plan assets is designed so that
34% to 44% of the assets have the objective of achieving a return in excess of the growth in
liabilities (comprised of public equities, private equities, real estate, hedge funds, high yield
bonds and emerging market debt) and 62% to 72% of the assets are invested as liability hedging assets
(where interest rate sensitivity of the liability hedging assets better match the interest rate
sensitivity of the liability) and a maximum of 10% is in cash. This allocation will shift as funded
status improves to a higher allocation of liability hedging assets. Target policies will be revisited
periodically to ensure they are in line with fund objectives. Both active and passive management
approaches are used depending on perceived market efficiencies and various other factors. Due to our
diversification and risk control processes, there are no significant concentrations of risk, in terms
of sector, industry, geography or company names.
Pension and healthcare and life plans assets do not include significant amounts of Verizon bonds or
common stock.

The following are general descriptions of asset categories, as well as the valuation methodologies
and inputs used to determine the fair value of each major category of assets.
Cash and cash equivalents include short-term investment funds (less than 90 days to maturity),
primarily in diversified portfolios of investment grade money market instruments and are valued using
quoted market prices or other valuation methods. The carrying value of cash equivalents approximates
fair value due to the short-term nature of these investments.
Investments in securities traded on national and foreign securities exchanges are valued by the
trustee at the last reported sale prices on the last business day of the year or, if no sales were
reported on that date, at the last reported bid prices. Government obligations, corporate bonds,
international bonds and asset-backed debt are valued using matrix prices with input from independent
third-party valuation sources. Over-the-counter securities are valued at the bid prices or the
average of the bid and ask prices on the last business day of the year from published sources or, if
not available, from other sources considered reliable such as multiple broker quotes.
Commingled funds not traded on national exchanges are priced by the custodian or fund's administrator
at their net asset value (NAV). Commingled funds held by third-party custodians appointed by the fund
managers provide the fund managers with a NAV. The fund managers have the responsibility for
providing this information to the custodian of the respective plan.
The investment manager of the entity values venture capital, corporate finance and natural resource
limited partnership investments. Real estate investments are valued at amounts based upon appraisal
reports prepared by either independent real estate appraisers or the investment manager using
discounted cash flows or market comparable data. Loans secured by mortgages are carried at the lesser
of the unpaid balance or appraised value of the underlying properties. The values assigned to these
investments are based upon available and current market information and do not necessarily represent
amounts that might ultimately be realized. Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation,
estimated fair values might differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a
ready market for the securities existed. These differences could be material.
Forward currency contracts, futures, and options are valued by the trustee at the exchange rates and
market prices prevailing on the last business day of the year. Both exchange rates and market prices
are readily available from published sources. These securities are classified by the asset class of
the underlying holdings.
Hedge funds are valued by the custodian at NAV based on statements received from the investment
manager. These funds are valued in accordance with the terms of their corresponding offering or
private placement memoranda.

Table of Contents
Commingled funds, hedge funds, venture capital, corporate finance, natural resource and real estate
limited partnership investments for which fair value is measured using the NAV per share as a
practical expedient are not leveled within the fair value hierarchy but are included in total
investments.
Employer Contributions
In 2023, we made a $ 200million discretionary contribution to one of our qualified pension plans, $
52million of contributions to our nonqualified pension plans and $ 936million of contributions to our
other postretirement benefit plans. For 2024, we expect no required qualified pension plan
contributions and insignificant nonqualified pension plan contributions. Contributions to our other
postretirement benefit plans are estimated to be approximately $ 770million in 2024.
Estimated Future Benefit Payments
The benefit payments to retirees are expected to be paid as follows:
 (dollars in millions) 
 Year Pension Benefits Health Care and Life

 2028 974 843 
 2029 to 2033 4,734 4,294 
Savings Plan and Employee Stock Ownership Plans
We maintain fourleveraged employee stock ownership plans (ESOP). We match a certain percentage of
eligible employee contributions to certain savings plans with shares of our common stock from this
ESOP. At December 31, 2023, the number of allocated shares of common stock in this ESOP was
42million. There were nounallocated shares of common stock in this ESOP at December 31, 2023. All
leveraged ESOP shares are included in earnings per share computations.
Total savings plan costs were $ 724million in 2023, $ 620million in 2022 and $ 690million in 2021.

Severance, Pension and Benefits (Credits) Charges
During 2023, in accordance with our accounting policy to recognize actuarial gains and losses in the
period in which they occur, we recorded net pre-tax pension and benefits charges of $ 992million in
our pension and postretirement benefit plans. The charges were recorded in Other income (expense),
net in our consolidated statement of income and were primarily driven by a charge of $ 534million due
to an increase in our healthcare cost trend rate assumption used to determine the current year
liabilities of our postretirement benefit plans from a weighted-average of 6.6% at December 31, 2022
to a weighted-average of 7.3% at December 31, 2023; a charge of $ 503million due to a decrease in our
discount rate assumption used to determine the current year liabilities of our pension plans ($
288million) and postretirement benefit plans ($ 215million) from a weighted-average of 5.2% at
December 31, 2022 to a weighted-average of 5.0% at December 31, 2023; a net credit of $ 45million
primarily due to changes in other actuarial adjustments, which includes the difference between our
estimated and our actual return on plan assets. During 2023, we also recorded net pre-tax severance
charges of $ 531million in Selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements
of income.
During 2022, we recorded net pre-tax pension and benefits credits of $ 1.7billion in our pension and
postretirement benefit plans. The credits were recorded in Other income (expense), net in our
consolidated statement of income and were primarily driven by a credit of $ 7.0billion due to an
increase in our discount rate assumption used to determine the current year liabilities of our
pension plans ($ 4.1billion) and postretirement benefit plans ($ 2.9billion) from a weighted-average
of 2.9% at December 31, 2021 to a weighted-average of 5.2% at December 31, 2022, a charge of $
5.5billion due to the difference between our estimated and our actual return on assets and a credit
of $ 206million due to other actuarial assumption adjustments. During 2022, we also
 94 
Table of Contents
recorded net pre-tax severance charges of $ 319million in Selling, general and administrative expense
in our consolidated statements of income.
During 2021, we recorded net pre-tax pension and benefits credits of $ 2.4billion in our pension and
postretirement benefit plans. The credits were recorded in Other income (expense), net in our
consolidated statement of income and were primarily driven by a credit of $ 1.1billion due to an
increase in our discount rate assumption used to determine the current year liabilities of our
pension plans and postretirement benefit plans from a weighted-average of 2.6% at December 31, 2020
to a weighted-average of 2.9% at December 31, 2021, a credit of $ 847million due to the difference
between our estimated and our actual return on assets and a credit of $ 453million due to other
actuarial assumption adjustments. During 2021, we also recorded net pre-tax severance charges of $
233million in Selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of income.
 Note 12. Taxes 
The components of income before provision for income taxes are as follows:
 Years Ended December  (dollars in millions)

 Total income tax provision $ 4,892 $ 6,523 $ 6,802 
The following table shows the principal reasons for the difference between the effective income tax
rate and the statutory federal income tax rate:
 Years Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2021 
 ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── 
 Statutory federal income tax rate 21.0 % 21.0 % 21.0 %

 Noncontrolling interest -0.6 -0.4 -0.4 
 Goodwill impairment 7.0 — — 
 Divestitures — — -0.6 
 Tax credits -0.8 -0.5 -0.5 
 Other, net -1.4 -0.9 -0.2 
 Effective income tax rate 28.8 % 23.1 % 23.1 % 
The effective income tax rate for 2023 was 28.8% compared to 23.1% for 2022. The increase in the
effective income tax rate was primarily due to the Verizon Business Group goodwill impairment charge
of $ 5.8billion that substantially decreased income before income taxes and is not deductible. The
decrease in the provision for income taxes was primarily due to the decrease in income before income
taxes in the current period.
The effective income tax rate for 2022 and 2021 was 23.1%. The effective income tax rate for the
twelve months ended December 31, 2022 was comparable to the similar period in 2021. The decrease in
the provision for income taxes was primarily due to the decrease in income before income taxes in the
current period.

Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities
Deferred taxes arise because of differences in the book and tax bases of certain assets and
liabilities. Significant components of deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:

 Other - liabilities 2,696 2,489 
 Deferred tax liabilities 57,315 54,735 
 Net deferred tax liability $ 45,633 $ 43,268 
At December 31, 2023, undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries indefinitely invested
outside the U.S. amounted to approximately $ 2.4billion. The majority of Verizon's cash flow is
generated from domestic operations and we are not dependent on foreign cash or earnings to meet our
funding requirements, nor do we intend to repatriate these undistributed foreign earnings to fund
U.S. operations. Furthermore, a portion of these undistributed earnings represents amounts that
legally must be kept in reserve in accordance with certain foreign jurisdictional requirements and
are unavailable for distribution or repatriation. As a result, we have not provided U.S. deferred
taxes on these undistributed earnings because we intend that they will remain indefinitely reinvested
outside of the U.S. and, therefore unavailable for use in funding U.S. operations. Determination of
the amount of unrecognized deferred taxes related to these undistributed earnings is not practicable.
At December 31, 2023, we had net after-tax loss, credit, and other carry forwards for income tax
purposes of approximately $ 1.9billion that relate to federal, state and foreign taxes. Of these net
after-tax loss, credit, and other carry forwards, approximately $ 1.0billion will expire between 2024
and 2043 and approximately $ 911million may be carried forward indefinitely.
During 2023, the valuation allowance decreased by an insignificant amount. The $ 1.3billion valuation
allowance at December 31, 2023 is primarily related to state and foreign taxes.
Unrecognized Tax Benefits

$ 2.5billion and $ 2.8billion, respectively, that if recognized, would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate.
We recognized the following net after-tax expenses (benefit) related to interest and penalties in the
provision for income taxes:

 ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

are as follows:
 At December 31, (dollars in millions) 
 ────────────────────────────────────────────────── 
 2023 $ 630 
 2022 544 
The decrease in unrecognized tax benefits in 2023 was primarily due to lapses of statutes of
limitations in the current period. The decrease in unrecognized tax benefits for 2022 was primarily
related to the resolution of issues with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) involving tax years
2015-2016 as well as final purchase accounting adjustments made in connection with the 2021
acquisition of TracFone.
Verizon and/or its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various
state, local and foreign jurisdictions. As a large taxpayer, we are under audit by the IRS and
multiple state and foreign jurisdictions for various open tax years. The IRS is currently examining
the Company’s U.S. income tax returns for tax years 2017 through 2019 and Cellco's U.S. income tax
return for tax years 2017 through 2020. Tax controversies are ongoing for tax years as early as 2011
in certain states and as early as 2000 outside the U.S. The amount of the liability for unrecognized
tax benefits will change in the next twelve months due to the expiration of the statute of
limitations in various jurisdictions and it is reasonably possible that various current tax
examinations will conclude or require reevaluations of the Company’s tax positions during this
period. An estimate of the range of the possible change cannot be made until these tax matters are
further developed or resolved.
 Note 13. Segment Information 
Reportable Segments
We have tworeportable segments that we operate and manage as strategic business units - Consumer and
Business. We measure and evaluate our reportable segments based on segment operating income,
consistent with the chief operating decision maker’s assessment of segment performance.
Our segments and their principal activities consist of the following:
 Segment Description 
 Our Consumer segment provides consumer-focused wireless and wireline 
 communications services and products. Our wireless services are 
 provided across one of the most extensive wireless networks in the U.S. 
 under the Verizon family of brands and through wholesale and other 
 arrangements. We also provide FWA broadband through our 5G or 4G LTE 
 Verizon Consumer Group networks as an alternative to traditional landline internet access. Our 
 wireline services are provided inninestates in the Mid-Atlantic and 
 Northeastern U.S., as well as Washington D.C., over our 100% 
 fiber-optic network through our Verizon Fios product portfolio and over 
 a traditional copper-based network to customers who are not served by 
 Fios. 
 Our Business segment provides wireless and wireline communications 
 services and products, including FWA broadband, data, video and 
 conferencing services, corporate networking solutions, security and 
 Verizon managed network services, local and long distance voice services and 
 Business Group network access to deliver various IoT services and products. We provide 
 these products and services to businesses, government customers and 
 wireless and wireline carriers across the U.S. and a subset of these 
 products and services to customers around the world. 
Our Consumer segment's wireless and wireline products and services are available to our retail
customers, as well as resellers that purchase wireless network access from us on a wholesale basis.
Our Business segment’s wireless and wireline products and services are organized by the primary
customer groups targeted by these offerings. During the first quarter of 2023, Verizon reorganized
the customer groups within its Business segment. Previously, this segment was comprised of
fourcustomer groups: Small and Medium Business, Global Enterprise, Public Sector and Other, and
Wholesale. Following the reorganization, there are now threecustomer groups: Enterprise and Public
Sector, Business Markets and Other, and Wholesale. Enterprise and Public Sector combines the
customers previously included in Global Enterprise and Public Sector and Other (excluding BlueJeans
and Connect customers) as well as the commercial wireline customers previously included in Small and
Medium Business. Business Markets and Other combines the customers previously
 97 
Table of Contents
included in Small and Medium Business (excluding commercial wireline customers), the BlueJeans
customers previously included in Global Enterprise and Public Sector and Other, and the Connect
customers previously included in Public Sector and Other. The Wholesale customer group remained
unchanged. Prior period operating revenue results within the Business segment have been recast for
these reorganized customer groups. There was no change to the composition of our reportable segments
and total segment results, nor the determination of segment profit.
Corporate and other primarily includes device insurance programs, investments in unconsolidated
businesses and development stage businesses that support our strategic initiatives, as well as
unallocated corporate expenses, certain pension and other employee benefit related costs and interest
and financing expenses. Corporate and other also includes the historical results of divested
businesses including Verizon Media, and other adjustments and gains and losses that are not allocated
or used in assessing segment performance due to their nature. Although such transactions are excluded
from the business segment results, they are included in reported consolidated earnings. Gains and
losses from these transactions that are not individually significant are included in segment results
and therefore included in the chief operating decision maker’s assessment of segment performance.
We completed the sale of Verizon Media on September 1, 2021. See Note 3 for additional information on
the sale of Verizon Media.

No single customer accounted for more than 10% of our total operating revenues during the years ended
December 31, 2023, 2022 or 2021. International operating revenues were not significant during the
years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, international long-
lived assets were not significant.
The chief operating decision maker does not review disaggregated assets on a segment basis;
therefore, such information is not presented. Depreciation and amortization included in the measure
of segment profitability is primarily allocated based on proportional usage, and is included within
Total reportable segment operating income.
 Note 14. Equity and Comprehensive Income (Loss) 
Equity
Common Stock
In February 2020, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized a share buyback program to
repurchase up to 100million shares of our common stock. The program will terminate when the aggregate
number of shares purchased reaches 100million
 100 
Table of Contents
or a new share repurchase plan superseding the current plan is authorized, whichever is sooner.
During the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, we did not repurchase any shares of our
common stock under our authorized share buyback program. At December 31, 2023, the maximum number of
shares that could be purchased by or on behalf of Verizon under our share buyback program was
100million.
Common stock has been used from time to time to satisfy some of the funding requirements of employee
and shareholder plans. During the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, we issued
4.4million, 2.1million and 2.1million shares of common stock from treasury stock, which had aggregate
values of $ 192million, $ 91million and $ 91million, respectively.
In connection with our acquisition of TracFone in November 2021, we issued approximately 57.6million
shares of our common stock from treasury stock valued at approximately $ 3.0billion. See Note 3 for
additional information.

Supplier Finance Program
We maintain a voluntary supplier finance program (SFP) with a financial institution which provides
certain suppliers the option, at their sole discretion, to participate in the program and sell their
receivables due from Verizon to the financial institution on a non-recourse basis. The eligible
suppliers negotiate the terms directly with the financial institution and we have no involvement in
establishing those terms nor are we a party to these agreements.
Our payments associated with the invoices from the suppliers participating in the SFP are made to the
financial institution according to the original invoice terms generally at 90 days from the invoice
date and for the original invoice amount. No additional payments are exchanged between Verizon and
the financial institution related to the SFP. Verizon does not pledge any assets nor provide any
guarantees to the financial institution in connection with the SFP. The SFP can be terminated by
Verizon or the financial institution with a 60-daynotice period.
Confirmed obligations outstanding related to suppliers participating in the SFP are recorded within
Accounts payable and accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets and the associated
payments are reflected in the operating activities section of our consolidated statements of cash
flows. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022 , $ 817million and $ 1.0billion, respectively, remained as
confirmed obligations outstanding related to suppliersparticipating in the SFP.
 Note 16. Commitments and Contingencies 
In the ordinary course of business, Verizon is involved in various litigation and regulatory
proceedings at the state and federal level. Where it is determined, in consultation with counsel
based on litigation and settlement risks, that a loss is probable and estimable in a given matter,
Verizon establishes an accrual. In none of the currently pending matters is the amount of accrual
material. An estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss in excess of the amounts
already accrued cannot be made at this time due to various factors typical in contested proceedings,
including: (1) uncertain damage theories and demands; (2) a less than complete factual record; (3)
uncertainty concerning legal theories and their resolution by courts or regulators; and (4) the
unpredictable nature of the opposing party and its demands. We continuously monitor these proceedings
as they develop and adjust any accrual or disclosure as needed. We do not expect that the ultimate
resolution of any pending regulatory or legal matter in future periods will have a material effect on
our financial condition, but it could have a material effect on our results of operations for a given
reporting period.
Verizon is currently involved in approximately 25federal district court actions alleging that Verizon
is infringing various patents. Most of these cases are brought by non-practicing entities and
effectively seek only monetary damages; a small number are brought by companies that have sold
products and could seek injunctive relief as well. These cases have progressed to various stages and
a small number may go to trial in the coming 12 months if they are not otherwise resolved.
In connection with the execution of agreements for the sales of businesses and investments, Verizon
ordinarily provides representations and warranties to the purchasers pertaining to a variety of
nonfinancial matters, such as ownership of the securities being sold, as well as indemnity from
certain financial losses. From time to time, counterparties may make claims under these provisions,
and Verizon will seek to defend against those claims and resolve them in the ordinary course of
business.
 103 
Table of Contents
As of December 31, 2023, letters of credit totaling approximately $ 803million, which were executed
in the normal course of business and support several financing arrangements and payment obligations
to third parties, were outstanding.
As of December 31, 2023, Verizon had 26renewable energy purchase agreements (REPAs) with third
parties. Each of the REPAs is based on the expected operation of a renewable energy-generating
facility and has a fixed price term of 12to 20years from the commencement of the facility's entry
into commercial operation. Thirteenof the facilities have entered into commercial operation, and the
remainder are under development. The REPAs generally are expected to be financially settled based on
the prevailing market price as energy is generated by the facilities.
We have various unconditional purchase obligations, which represent agreements to purchase goods or
services that are enforceable and legally binding. We estimate that these unconditional purchase
obligations, for contracts with terms in excess of one year, total $ 21.7billion, and primarily
represent commitments to purchase network equipment, software and services, content, marketing
services and other items which will be used or sold in the ordinary course of business from a variety
of suppliers. Of this total amount, $ 8.9billion is attributable to 2024, $ 8.2billion is
attributable to 2025, $ 2.5billion is attributable to 2026, $ 1.1billion is attributable to 2027, $
408million is attributable to 2028 and $ 603million is attributable to years thereafter. These
amounts do not represent our entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those
items that are the subject of contractual obligations. Our commitments are generally determined based
on the noncancelable quantities to which we are contractually obliged. Since the commitments to
purchase programming services from television networks and broadcast stations have no minimum volume
requirement, we estimated our obligation based on number of subscribers at December 31, 2023, and
applicable rates stipulated in the contracts in effect at that time. We also purchase products and
services as needed with no firm commitment.
 Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with 
 Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure 
None.
 Item 9A.    Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the effectiveness of the
registrant’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934), as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, that
ensure that information relating to the registrant which is required to be disclosed in this report
is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within required time periods using the criteria for
effective internal control established in Internal Control–Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. Based on this evaluation,
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the registrant’s
disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2023.
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial 
 Reporting 
In the ordinary course of business, we routinely review our system of internal control over financial
reporting and make changes to our systems and processes that are intended to ensure an effective
internal control environment. In the third quarter of 2020, we began a multi-year implementation of a
new global enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, which will replace many of our existing core
financial systems. The new ERP system is designed to enhance the flow of financial information,
facilitate data analysis and accelerate information reporting. The implementation is expected to
occur in phases over the next several years.
As the phased implementation of the new ERP system continues, we could have changes to our processes
and procedures which, in turn, could result in changes to our internal controls over financial
reporting. As such changes occur, we will evaluate quarterly whether such changes materially affect
our internal control over financial reporting.
There were no changes in Verizon's internal control over financial reporting during the fourth
quarter of 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting.
 Management's Annual Report on Internal Control 
 over Financial Reporting 
The management of Verizon Communications Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting of Verizon. Management has evaluated internal
control over financial reporting of Verizon using the criteria for effective internal control
established in Internal Control–Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013.
Management has assessed the effectiveness of Verizon’s internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2023. Based on this assessment, management believes that the internal control over
financial reporting of Verizon is effective as of December 31, 2023. In connection with this
assessment, there were no material weaknesses in Verizon’s internal control over
 104

financial reporting identified by management. The Company’s independent registered public accounting
firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has provided an attestation report on Verizon’s internal control over
financial reporting and is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
