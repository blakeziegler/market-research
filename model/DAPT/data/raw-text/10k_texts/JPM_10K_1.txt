│ Item 1. Business. │
 Overview 
JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorganChase” or the
“Firm”, NYSE: JPM), a financial holding company
incorporated under Delaware law in 1968, is a
leading financial services firm based in the
United States of America (“U.S.”), with
operations worldwide. JPMorganChase had $4.0
trillion in assets and $344.8 billion in
stockholders’ equity as of December 31, 2024.
The Firm is a leader in investment banking,
financial services for consumers and small
businesses, commercial banking, financial
transaction processing and asset management.
Under the J.P. Morgan and Chase brands, the Firm
serves millions of customers, predominantly in
the U.S., and many of the world’s most prominent
corporate, institutional and government clients
globally.
JPMorganChase’s principal bank subsidiary is
JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association
(“JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.”), a national
banking association with U.S. branches in 48
states and Washington, D.C. JPMorganChase’s
principal non-bank subsidiary is J.P. Morgan
Securities LLC (“J.P. Morgan Securities”), a
U.S. broker-dealer. The bank and non-bank
subsidiaries of JPMorganChase operate nationally
as well as through overseas branches and
subsidiaries, representative offices and
subsidiary foreign banks. The Firm’s principal
operating subsidiaries outside the U.S. are J.P.
Morgan Securities plc and J.P. Morgan SE
(“JPMSE”), which are subsidiaries of JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A. and are based in the United
Kingdom (“U.K.”) and Germany, respectively.
The Firm’s website is www.jpmorganchase.com.
JPMorganChase makes available on its website,
free of charge, annual reports on Form 10-K,
quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current
reports on Form 8-K pursuant to Section 13(a) or
Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as soon as reasonably practicable after it
electronically files or furnishes such material
to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
(the “SEC”) at www.sec.gov. JPMorganChase makes
new and important information about the Firm
available on its website at
https://www.jpmorganchase.com, including on the
Investor Relations section of its website at
https://www.jpmorganchase.com/ir. Information on
the Firm's website, including documents on the
website that are referenced in this Form 10-K,
is not incorporated by reference into this
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2024 (“2024 Form 10-K” or “Form
10-K”) or the Firm’s other filings with the SEC.
 Business segments & Corporate 
Effective in the second quarter of 2024,
JPMorganChase reorganized its reportable
business segments by combining the former
Corporate & Investment Bank and Commercial
Banking business segments to form one reportable
segment, the Commercial & Investment Bank. As a
result of the reorganization, the Firm has three
reportable business segments – Consumer &
Community Banking (“CCB”), Commercial &
Investment Bank (“CIB”) and Asset & Wealth
Management (“AWM”) – with the remaining
activities in Corporate. The Firm’s consumer
business segment is CCB, and the Firm’s
wholesale business segments are CIB and AWM.
A description of the Firm’s reportable business
segments and the products and services that they
provide to their respective client bases, as
well as a description of Corporate activities,
is provided in the Management’s discussion and
analysis of financial condition and results of
operations section of this Form 10-K
(“Management’s discussion and analysis” or
“MD&A”) under the heading “Business Segment &
Corporate Results,” which begins on page 52, and
in Note 32.
 Competition 
JPMorganChase and its subsidiaries and
affiliates operate in highly competitive
environments. Competitors include other banks,
brokerage firms, investment banking companies,
merchant banks, hedge funds, commodity trading
companies, private equity firms, insurance
companies, mutual fund companies, investment
managers, credit card companies, mortgage
banking companies, trust companies, securities
processing companies, automobile financing
companies, leasing companies, e-commerce and
other internet-based companies, financial
technology companies, and other companies
engaged in providing similar and new products
and services. The Firm’s businesses generally
compete on the basis of the quality and variety
of the Firm’s products and services, transaction
execution, innovation, reputation and price.
Competition also varies based on the types of
clients, customers, industries and geographies
served. With respect to some of its geographies
and products, JPMorganChase competes globally;
with respect to others, the Firm competes on a
national or regional basis. New competitors in
the financial services industry continue to
emerge, including firms that offer products and
services solely through the internet and non-
financial companies that offer products and
services that disintermediate traditional
banking products and services offered by
financial services firms such as JPMorganChase.
 1 
║ Part I ║
 Supervision and regulation 
The Firm is subject to extensive and
comprehensive regulation under U.S. federal and
state laws, as well as the applicable laws of
the jurisdictions outside the U.S. in which the
Firm does business.
Financial holding company:
Consolidated supervision . JPMorgan Chase & Co.
is a bank holding company (“BHC”) and a
financial holding company (“FHC”) under U.S.
federal law, and is subject to comprehensive
consolidated supervision, regulation and
examination by the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”).
The Federal Reserve acts as the supervisor of
the consolidated operations of BHCs. Certain of
JPMorganChase’s subsidiaries are also regulated
directly by additional authorities based on the
activities or licenses of those subsidiaries.
JPMorganChase’s national bank subsidiary,
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., is supervised and
regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of
the Currency (“OCC”) and, with respect to
certain matters, by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”).
JPMorganChase’s U.S. broker-dealers are
supervised and regulated by the Securities and
Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and the Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”).
Subsidiaries of the Firm that engage in certain
futures-related and swaps-related activities are
supervised and regulated by the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”). J.P. Morgan
Securities plc holds a banking license in the
U.K. and is regulated by the U.K. Prudential
Regulation Authority (the “PRA”) and the U.K.
Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”).
JPMSE is a Germany-based credit institution
jointly regulated by the European Central Bank
(“ECB”), the German Financial Supervisory
Authority and the German Central Bank, as well
as the local regulators in each of the countries
in which it operates. The Firm’s other non-U.S.
subsidiaries are regulated by the banking,
securities, prudential, payments and conduct
regulatory authorities, as applicable, in the
countries in which they operate.
Permissible business activities . The Bank
Holding Company Act restricts BHCs from engaging
in business activities other than the business
of banking and certain closely-related
activities. FHCs are permitted to engage in a
broader range of financial activities. The
Federal Reserve has the authority to limit an
FHC’s ability to conduct otherwise permissible
activities if the FHC or any of its depository
institution subsidiaries ceases to meet
applicable eligibility requirements. The Federal
Reserve may also impose corrective capital
and/or managerial requirements on the FHC, and
if deficiencies are persistent, may require
divestiture of the FHC’s depository
institutions. If any
depository institution controlled by an FHC
fails to maintain a satisfactory rating under
the Community Reinvestment Act, the Federal
Reserve must prohibit the FHC and its
subsidiaries from engaging in any new activities
other than those permissible for BHCs, or
acquiring a company engaged in such activities.
Capital and liquidity requirements . The Federal
Reserve establishes capital, liquidity and
leverage requirements for JPMorganChase that are
generally consistent with the international
Basel III capital and liquidity framework and
evaluates the Firm’s compliance with those
requirements. The OCC establishes similar
requirements for JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.
Certain of the Firm’s non-U.S. subsidiaries and
branches are also subject to local capital and
liquidity requirements.
Banking supervisors globally continue to refine
and enhance the Basel III capital framework for
financial institutions. In July 2023, U.S.
banking regulators released a proposal to amend
the U.S. risk-based capital framework to
incorporate certain elements of the revised
international Basel III capital framework. The
proposal would significantly revise risk-based
capital requirements for banks with assets of
$100 billion or more, including the Firm and
other U.S. global systemically important banks
("GSIBs"). Finalization of the proposal,
including the required implementation date, is
uncertain. The Firm continues to monitor
developments and potential impacts.
In the EU and U.K., regulators have finalized
the rules implementing their Basel III
frameworks. The new rules became effective in
the EU beginning January 1, 2025, with market
risk aspects delayed until January 1, 2026. In
January 2025, the PRA announced that it intends
to delay the implementation of the new rules in
the U.K. to January 1, 2027. There are certain
transitional arrangements applicable in both the
EU and U.K. until 2032 and 2030, respectively.
Stress tests . As a large BHC, JPMorganChase is
subject to supervisory stress testing
administered by the Federal Reserve as part of
the Federal Reserve’s annual Comprehensive
Capital Analysis and Review (“CCAR”) framework.
The Firm must conduct annual company-run stress
tests and must also submit an annual capital
plan to the Federal Reserve, taking into account
the results of separate stress tests designed by
each of the Firm and the Federal Reserve. The
Federal Reserve uses the results under the
severely adverse scenario from its supervisory
stress test to determine the Firm’s Stress
Capital Buffer (“SCB”) requirement for the
coming year, which forms part of the Firm’s
applicable capital buffers. The Firm is required
to file its annual CCAR submission on April 5,
2025. The Federal Reserve will notify the Firm
of its indicative SCB requirement by June 30,
2025 and final SCB requirement by August 31,
2025. The Firm’s final
 2 
SCB requirement will become effective on October
1, 2025. The OCC requires JPMorgan Chase Bank,
N.A. to perform separate, similar stress tests
annually. The Firm publishes each year the
results of the annual stress tests for the Firm
and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. under the
supervisory “severely adverse” scenarios
provided by the Federal Reserve and the OCC. In
December 2024, the Federal Reserve indicated in
a press release that it intends to seek public
comment on changes to its stress testing
framework. Additionally, there is a pending
legal challenge to the manner in which stress
testing is administered. Refer to Litigation and
regulatory challenges on pages 6-7 for further
information.
Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 97–107
and Liquidity Risk Management on pages 108–115
for more information.
Enhanced prudential standards . As part of its
mandate to identify and monitor risks to the
financial stability of the U.S. posed by large
banking organizations, the Financial Stability
Oversight Council (“FSOC”) recommends prudential
standards and reporting requirements to the
Federal Reserve for systemically important
financial institutions (“SIFIs”), such as
JPMorganChase. The Federal Reserve has adopted
several rules to implement those heightened
prudential standards, including rules relating
to risk management and corporate governance of
subject BHCs. JPMorganChase is required under
these rules to comply with enhanced liquidity
and overall risk management standards, including
oversight by the board of directors of risk
management activities.
Holding company as a source of strength.
JPMorgan Chase & Co. is required to serve as a
source of financial strength for its depository
institution subsidiaries and to commit resources
to support those subsidiaries, including when
directed to do so by the Federal Reserve.
Regulation of acquisitions . Acquisitions by
BHCs and their banks are subject to
requirements, limitations and prohibitions
established by law and by the Federal Reserve
and the OCC. For example, FHCs and BHCs are
required to obtain the approval of the Federal
Reserve before they acquire more than 5% of the
voting shares of an unaffiliated bank. In
addition, acquisitions by financial companies
are generally prohibited if, as a result of the
acquisition, the total liabilities of the
financial company would exceed 10% of the total
liabilities of all financial companies, as
determined under Federal Reserve regulations.
Furthermore, for certain acquisitions, the Firm
must provide written notice to the Federal
Reserve prior to acquiring direct or indirect
ownership or control of any voting shares of any
company with over $10 billion in assets that is
engaged in activities that are “financial in
nature.” Moreover, while FHCs may engage in a
broader range of activities (including
acquisitions) than BHCs, the Federal Reserve has
the authority to limit an FHC’s ability to
conduct otherwise permissible acquisitions if
the FHC or any of its depository institution
subsidiaries ceases to meet applicable
eligibility requirements.
Ongoing obligations . The Firm is subject to a
five-year cooperation obligation under an order
issued by the CFTC on September 29, 2020,
relating to precious metals and U.S. Treasuries
markets investigations. The Firm also remains
subject to consent orders entered into in March
2024 with the OCC and the Board of Governors of
the Federal Reserve System, and a resolution
entered into in May 2024 with the CFTC, which
relate to the Firm’s processes to inventory
trading venues and confirm the completeness of
certain data fed to trade surveillance
platforms.
Subsidiary banks:
The activities of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., the
Firm’s principal subsidiary bank, are limited to
those specifically authorized under the National
Bank Act and related interpretations of the OCC.
The OCC has authority to bring an enforcement
action against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. for
unsafe or unsound banking practices, which could
include limiting JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s
ability to conduct otherwise permissible
activities, or imposing corrective capital or
managerial requirements on the bank.
FDIC deposit insurance. The FDIC deposit
insurance fund provides insurance coverage for
certain deposits and is funded through
assessments on banks, including JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A. The FDIC is required to maintain a
minimum reserve ratio, which measures the
balance of reserves in the deposit insurance
fund against an estimate of FDIC-insured
deposits, of 1.35%. The reserve ratio is
currently below the statutory minimum and, in
October 2022, the FDIC adopted a final rule to
raise bank assessments and accelerate the time
by which the reserve ratio would meet the
statutory minimum. As a result, the FDIC has
adopted a restoration plan to bring the reserve
ratio up to the required 1.35% by September 30,
2028, with a longer-term target of maintaining a
reserve ratio of 2%.
FDIC powers upon a bank insolvency. Upon any
insolvency of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., the
FDIC could be appointed as conservator or
receiver under the Federal Deposit Insurance
Act. The FDIC has broad powers to transfer
assets and liabilities without the approval of
the institution’s creditors.
Prompt corrective action. The Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991
requires the relevant federal banking regulator
to take “prompt corrective action” with respect
to a depository institution if that institution
does not meet certain
 3 
║ Part I ║
capital adequacy standards. The Federal Reserve
is also authorized to take appropriate action
against the parent BHC, such as JPMorgan Chase &
Co., based on the undercapitalized status of any
bank subsidiary. In certain instances, the BHC
would be required to guarantee the performance
of the capital restoration plan for its
undercapitalized subsidiary.
Heightened Supervisory Standards. In the U.S.,
the OCC has established guidelines setting forth
heightened standards for large banks, including
minimum standards for the design and
implementation of a risk governance framework
for banks. Under these standards, a bank’s risk
governance framework must ensure that the bank’s
risk profile is easily distinguished and
separate from that of its parent BHC for risk
management purposes. The bank’s board or risk
committee is responsible for approving the
bank’s risk governance framework, providing
active oversight of the bank’s risk-taking
activities, and holding management accountable
for adhering to the risk governance framework.
The Firm’s banking entities in the EU and the
U.K. are subject to supervisory expectations
published by the ECB and the PRA, respectively,
addressing bank strategy, governance and risk
management in the areas of climate change,
operational resilience, reliance on IT systems
and third-party services, and resilience from
macro-financial and geopolitical shocks.
Restrictions on transactions with affiliates.
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its subsidiaries
are subject to restrictions imposed by federal
law on extensions of credit to, investments in
stock or securities of, and derivatives,
securities lending and certain other
transactions with, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and
certain other affiliates. These restrictions
prevent JPMorgan Chase & Co. and other
affiliates from borrowing from JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A. and its subsidiaries unless the loans
are secured in specified amounts and comply with
certain other requirements.
Dividend restrictions. Federal law imposes
limitations on the payment of dividends by
national banks, such as JPMorgan Chase Bank,
N.A. Refer to Note 26 for the amount of
dividends that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. could
pay, at January 1, 2025, to JPMorganChase
without the approval of the banking regulators.
The OCC and the Federal Reserve also have
authority to prohibit or limit the payment of
dividends of a bank subsidiary that they
supervise if, in the banking regulator’s
opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute
an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the
financial condition of the bank.
Depositor preference. Under federal law, the
claims of a receiver of an insured depositary
institution (“IDI”) for administrative expense
and the claims of holders of
U.S. deposit liabilities (including the FDIC and
deposits in non-U.S. branches that are dually
payable in the U.S. and in a non-U.S. branch)
have priority over the claims of other unsecured
creditors of the institution, including
depositors in non-U.S. branches and public
noteholders.
Consumer supervision and regulation.
JPMorganChase and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. are
subject to supervision and regulation in the
U.S. by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
(“CFPB”) with respect to federal consumer
protection laws, including laws relating to fair
lending and the prohibition of unfair, deceptive
or abusive acts or practices in connection with
the offer, sale or provision of consumer
financial products and services. The CFPB also
has jurisdiction over small business lending
activities with respect to fair lending and the
Equal Credit Opportunity Act. As part of its
regulatory oversight, the CFPB has authority to
take enforcement actions against firms that
offer certain products and services to consumers
using practices that are deemed to be unfair,
deceptive or abusive. In March 2024, the CFPB
released a final rule which significantly
reduces the late payment fees that large credit
card issuers, including the Firm, are permitted
to charge to customers (the “CFPB Late Fee
Rule”). The final rule is currently stayed
pending resolution of an industry-led challenge
in federal court. Refer to Litigation and
regulatory challenges on pages 6-7 for further
information.
In addition, in October 2024, the CFPB issued a
final rule that requires data providers,
including banks, to make certain consumer data
available to consumers and authorized third
parties in electronic form beginning in April
2026 (the “CFPB Data Sharing Rule”). Refer to
Litigation and regulatory challenges on pages
6-7 for further information.
Separately, in December 2024, the CFPB announced
a final rule that would significantly restrict
overdraft fees for certain insured depository
institutions, including the Firm (the “CFPB
Overdraft Rule”). The rule imposes certain
requirements on overdraft protections that are
similar to those that apply to credit cards,
unless the institution prices the overdraft fee
at $5 per transaction or the institution’s cost
as outlined by the CFPB . Refer to Litigation
and regulatory challenges on pages 6-7 for
further information.
In October 2023, the Federal Reserve Board
proposed to lower the maximum interchange fee
that large debit card issuers, including the
Firm, would be permitted to receive for a debit
card transaction. The proposal would also
establish a process for automatically publishing
an updated maximum fee amount every other year
going forward. The Firm’s consumer activities
are also subject to regulation under state
 4 
statutes which are enforced by the Attorney
General or empowered agency of each state.
In the U.K., the Firm operates a retail bank
through J.P. Morgan Europe Limited (“JPMEL”) and
provides retail investment management services
through Nutmeg Saving and Investment Limited
(“Nutmeg”). JPMEL is regulated by the PRA, and
both JPMEL and Nutmeg are regulated by the FCA
with respect to their conduct of financial
services in the U.K., including obligations
relating to the fair treatment of customers.
JPMEL is also regulated by the U.K. Payment
Systems Regulator with respect to its operation
and use of payment systems. In addition, the
retail businesses of JPMEL and Nutmeg are
subject to U.K. consumer-protection legislation.
Securities and broker-dealer regulation:
The Firm conducts securities underwriting,
dealing and brokerage activities in the U.S.
through J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and other
non-bank broker-dealer subsidiaries, all of
which are subject to regulations of the SEC,
FINRA and the New York Stock Exchange, among
others. The Firm conducts similar securities
activities outside the U.S. subject to local
regulatory requirements. In the U.K., those
activities are primarily conducted by J.P.
Morgan Securities plc and in the EU, those
activities are primarily conducted by JPMSE.
Broker-dealers are subject to laws and
regulations covering all aspects of the
securities business, including sales and trading
practices, securities offerings, publication of
research reports, use of customer funds, the
financing of client purchases, capital
structure, record-keeping and retention, and the
conduct of their directors, officers and
employees. Refer to Broker-dealer regulatory
capital on page 107 for information concerning
the capital of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, J.P.
Morgan Securities plc and JPMSE. In addition,
the Firm's sales and trading activities, which
are conducted through both bank and non-bank
subsidiaries, are subject to laws and
regulations relating to market conduct,
including prohibitions on manipulative or anti-
competitive practices.
Investment management regulation:
The Firm’s asset and wealth management
businesses are subject to significant regulation
in jurisdictions around the world relating to,
among other things, the safeguarding and
management of client assets, offerings of funds
and marketing activities. Certain of the Firm’s
subsidiaries are registered with, and subject to
oversight by, the SEC as investment advisers and
broker-dealers. The Firm’s registered investment
advisers in the U.S. are subject to the
fiduciary and other obligations imposed under
the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and
applicable state and federal law. The Firm’s
bank fiduciary activities are subject to
supervision by the OCC.
The Firm’s asset and wealth management
businesses continue to be subject to ongoing
rule-making and implementation of new
regulations and other guidance, including by the
SEC and certain U.S. states with respect to
enhanced standards of conduct and conflicts of
interest. In April 2024, the Department of Labor
(“DOL”) finalized a new “fiduciary” rule that
would significantly expand the scope for
defining who can be deemed investment advice
fiduciaries for purposes of retirement plans and
individual retirement accounts (“IRAs”) under
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974, as amended (the “Fiduciary Rule”). Among
the most significant impacts of the rule and
related amendments to prohibited transaction
exemptions would be the impact on the fee and
compensation practices at financial institutions
that offer investment recommendations to
retirement clients, including in the context of
rollovers from an employer plan to an IRA. The
effective date of the Fiduciary Rule has been
stayed by two federal courts. Refer to
Litigation and regulatory challenges on pages
6-7 for further information.
Derivatives regulation:
The Firm is subject to comprehensive regulation
of its derivatives businesses. In the U.S.,
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan
Securities LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities plc
are registered with the CFTC as “swap dealers”.
In addition, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P.
Morgan Securities LLC are registered with the
SEC as “security-based swap dealers”. As a
result, these entities are subject to a
comprehensive regulatory framework applicable to
their swap or security-based swap activities,
including capital requirements, rules requiring
the collateralization of uncleared swaps and
security-based swaps, rules regarding
segregation of counterparty collateral, business
conduct and documentation standards, rules
requiring the central clearing of standardized
over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivatives,
requirements that certain standardized OTC swaps
be traded on regulated trading venues, record-
keeping and reporting obligations, and anti-
fraud and anti-manipulation requirements.
Similar requirements have also been established
in the European Union (“EU”) under the European
Market Infrastructure Regulation (“EMIR”) and
the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive
(“MiFID II”), as well as in the U.K. and other
jurisdictions around the world.
J.P. Morgan Securities LLC is also registered
with the CFTC as a futures commission merchant
and is a member of the National Futures
Association.
Data, privacy, cybersecurity and artificial
intelligence regulation:
The Firm and its subsidiaries are subject to
laws, rules and regulations globally concerning
data, including data protection, consumer
protection, privacy, cybersecurity, artificial
intelligence and related
 5 
║ Part I ║
matters. These laws, rules and regulations are
constantly evolving, subject to interpretation,
remain a focus of regulators globally, may be
enforced by private parties or government
bodies, and continue to have a significant
impact on all of the Firm’s businesses and
operations.
For example, the Digital Operational Resilience
Act (DORA) mandates that the Firm’s financial
services subsidiaries operating in the EU comply
with requirements relating to information and
communications technology (“ICT”) risk
management, reporting, security control testing
and ICT third party risks beginning in January
2025. In addition, the EU Artificial
Intelligence Act regulates the development and
deployment of artificial intelligence systems
within the EU, with phased-in requirements that
began in February 2025.
The Bank Secrecy Act and Economic Sanctions:
The Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”) requires all
financial institutions, including banks and
securities broker-dealers, to establish a risk-
based system of internal controls reasonably
designed to prevent money laundering and the
financing of terrorism. The BSA includes a
variety of record-keeping and reporting
requirements, as well as due diligence/know-
your-customer documentation requirements. The
Firm is also subject to the regulations and
economic sanctions programs administered and
enforced by the U.S. Treasury’s Office of
Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) and EU and U.K.
authorities which target entities or individuals
that are, or are located in countries that are,
involved in activities including terrorism,
hostilities, embezzlement or human rights
violations. The Firm is also subject to economic
sanctions laws, rules and regulations in other
jurisdictions in which it operates, including
those that conflict with or prohibit a firm such
as JPMorganChase from complying with certain
laws, rules and regulations to which it is
otherwise subject.
Anti-Corruption:
The Firm is subject to laws and regulations
relating to corrupt and illegal payments to
government officials and others in the
jurisdictions in which it operates, including
the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the
U.K. Bribery Act.
Compensation practices:
The Firm’s compensation practices are subject to
oversight by the Federal Reserve, as well as
other agencies. The Federal Reserve has jointly
issued guidance with the FDIC and the OCC that
is designed to ensure that incentive
compensation paid by banking organizations does
not encourage imprudent risk-taking that
threatens the organizations’ safety and
soundness. The Financial Stability Board (“FSB”)
has also established standards covering
compensation principles for banks. The Firm’s
compensation
practices are also subject to regulation and
oversight by regulators in other jurisdictions,
notably the Fifth Capital Requirements Directive
(“CRD V”), as implemented in the EU and as
largely adopted in the U.K, which includes
compensation-related provisions. The European
Banking Authority has instituted guidelines on
compensation policies including under CRD V
which in certain countries (such as Germany) are
implemented or supplemented by local regulations
or guidelines. The U.K. regulators have also
instituted regulations and guidelines on
compensation policies, which diverge in certain
areas from EU rules. The Firm expects that the
implementation of regulatory guidelines
regarding compensation in the U.S. and other
countries will continue to evolve, and may
affect the manner in which the Firm structures
its compensation programs and practices.
Sustainability:
Policymakers in the U.K. and the EU have
continued to implement and enhance
sustainability-related initiatives and
disclosure requirements. The Corporate
Sustainability Reporting Directive (“CSRD”) will
replace and significantly expand the scope and
content of certain EU ESG reporting
requirements, with phased-in requirements
expected to start with fiscal year 2024. The
implementation of CSRD into local law has been
delayed in a number of member states, including
in Germany, and the Firm continues to monitor
developments and potential impacts. In addition,
in July 2024, the EU enacted the Corporate
Sustainability Due Diligence Directive
(“CSDDD”), which provides for phased-in
requirements starting in 2027. The CSDDD sets
mandatory due diligence obligations for
companies to address actual and potential human
rights violations and environmental adverse
impacts stemming from their own operations and
business relationships, including the activities
of certain companies with which they have
established business relationships and also
requires the adoption of company-specific
climate-related transition plans. Both the CSRD
and CSDDD will impact certain of the Firm’s EU
and non-EU entities.
Litigation and regulatory challenges:
Trade organizations representing the financial
services industry and others have filed lawsuits
challenging various laws, rules and regulations
that, if enacted, adopted or implemented, could
have significant adverse impacts on the results
of operations or compliance costs of financial
institutions, including the Firm. These matters
include:
• Stress tests: The Bank Policy Institute
(“BPI”), the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other
trade organizations filed an action against the
Federal Reserve in the United States District
Court for the Southern District of Ohio in
December 2024 challenging the manner in which
the annual stress testing process is
administered.
 6 
• CFPB Late Fee Rule : This rule has been stayed
pending resolution of an action challenging the
rule filed against the CFPB in the United States
District Court for the Northern District of
Texas in March 2024 by trade organizations
including the American Bankers Association and
the Consumer Bankers Association.
• CFPB Data Sharing Rule : The BPI, the Kentucky
Bankers Association and other organizations
filed an action against the CFPB in the United
States District Court for the Eastern District
of Kentucky in October 2024 challenging key
aspects of this rule.
• CFPB Overdraft Rule : An action filed by trade
organizations led by the Mississippi Bankers
Association against the CFPB in the United
States District Court for the Southern District
of Mississippi in December 2024 seeks a
preliminary injunction to stay the October 1,
2025 effective date of this rule. The CFPB has
consented in part to stay the effective date of
the rule by 90 days and to temporarily stay the
litigation. The preliminary injunction and the
stay of litigation are pending court approval.
• Fiduciary Rule : Trade organizations including
the Federation of Americans for Consumer Choice
and the American Council of Life Insurers filed
actions against the DOL seeking to enjoin this
rule, and in July 2024, the effective date of
the rule was stayed by two United States
District Courts.

The above summary is subject in its entirety to
the discussion of the risk factors set forth
below .
 Regulatory 
JPMorganChase’s businesses are highly regulated,
and the laws, rules and regulations that apply
to JPMorganChase have a significant impact on
its business and operations.
JPMorganChase is a financial services firm with
operations worldwide. JPMorganChase must comply
with the laws, rules and regulations that apply
to its operations in all of the jurisdictions
around the world in which it does business, and
financial services firms such as JPMorganChase
are subject to extensive and constantly-evolving
regulation and supervision.
The regulation and supervision of JPMorganChase
significantly affects the way that it conducts
its business and structures its operations, and
JPMorganChase could be required to make changes
to its business and operations in response to
supervisory expectations or decisions or to new
or changed laws,
rules and regulations. These types of
developments could result in JPMorganChase
incurring additional costs or experiencing a
reduction in revenues to comply with applicable
laws, rules and regulations, which could reduce
its profitability. Furthermore, JPMorganChase’s
entry into or acquisition of a new business or
an increase in its principal investments may
require JPMorganChase to comply with additional
laws, rules, and regulations.
Additionally, JPMorganChase’s ability to execute
certain business initiatives could become more
challenging due to increased regulation in the
financial services industry, such as limitations
on late payment, overdraft and interchange fees.
This could adversely affect JPMorganChase’s
earnings from its consumer businesses, prompting
the reevaluation or adjustment of certain
businesses or product offerings, as well as the
reallocation of resources and incurrence of
restructuring costs, which could impact revenue
and profitability in the affected lines of
business.
In response to new and existing laws, rules and
regulations and expanded supervision,
JPMorganChase has in the past been and could in
the future be, required to:
• limit the products and services that it offers
• reduce the liquidity that it can provide
through its market-making activities
• refrain from engaging in business
opportunities that it might otherwise pursue
• pay higher taxes (including as part of any
minimum global tax regime), assessments, levies
or other governmental charges, including in
connection with the resolution of tax
examinations
• incur losses, including with respect to
fraudulent transactions perpetrated against its
customers
• dispose of certain assets, and do so at times
or prices that are disadvantageous
• impose restrictions on certain business
activities, or
• increase the prices that it charges for
products and services, which could reduce the
demand for them.
Any failure by JPMorganChase to comply with the
laws, rules and regulations to which it is
subject could result in:
• increased regulatory and supervisory scrutiny
• regulatory and governmental enforcement
actions
• the imposition of fines, penalties or other
sanctions
• increased exposure to litigation, or
• harm to its reputation.
 11 
║ Part I ║
Differences and inconsistencies in financial
services regulation and supervision can
negatively impact JPMorganChase’s businesses,
operations and financial results.
The content and application of laws, rules and
regulations affecting financial services firms
can vary according to factors such as the size
of the firm, the jurisdiction in which it is
organized or operates, and other criteria. For
example:
• larger firms such as JPMorganChase are often
subject to more stringent supervision,
regulation and regulatory scrutiny
• financial technology companies and other non-
traditional competitors may not be subject to
banking regulation, or may be supervised by a
national or state regulatory agency that does
not have the same resources or regulatory
priorities as the regulatory agencies that
supervise more diversified financial services
firms, or
• the financial services regulatory and
supervisory framework in a particular
jurisdiction may favor financial institutions
that are based in that jurisdiction.
These types of differences in the regulatory and
supervisory framework can result in
JPMorganChase losing market share to competitors
that are less regulated or not subject to
regulation, especially with respect to
unregulated financial products.
There can also be significant differences in the
ways that similar regulatory initiatives
affecting the financial services industry are
implemented in the U.S. and in other countries
and regions in which JPMorganChase does
business. For example, when adopting rules that
are intended to implement a global regulatory or
supervisory standard, a national regulator may
introduce additional or more restrictive
requirements, which can create competitive
disadvantages for financial services firms, such
as JPMorganChase, that may be subject to those
enhanced regulations.
In addition, certain national and multi-national
bodies and governmental agencies outside the
U.S. have adopted laws, rules or regulations
that may conflict with or prohibit JPMorganChase
from complying with laws, rules and regulations
to which it is otherwise subject, creating
conflict of law issues that also increase its
risk of non-compliance in those jurisdictions.
Legislative and regulatory initiatives outside
the U.S. have required and could in the future
require JPMorganChase to make significant
modifications to its operations and legal entity
structure in the relevant countries or regions
in order to comply with those requirements.
These include laws, rules and regulations that
have been adopted or proposed, as well as
regulatory expectations, relating to:
• the establishment of locally-based
intermediate holding companies or operating
subsidiaries
• requirements to maintain minimum amounts of
capital or liquidity in locally-based
subsidiaries
• the implementation of processes within
locally-based subsidiaries to comply with local
regulatory requirements or expectations
• the separation (or “ring fencing”) of core
banking products and services from markets
activities
• requirements for the orderly resolution of
financial institutions
• requirements for executing or settling
transactions on exchanges or through central
counterparties (“CCPs”), or for depositing funds
with other financial institutions or clearing
and settlement systems
• position limits and reporting rules for
derivatives
• governance and accountability regimes
• conduct of business and control requirements,
and
• restrictions on compensation.
These types of differences, inconsistencies and
conflicts in financial services regulation have
required and could in the future require
JPMorganChase to:
• divest assets or restructure its operations
• maintain higher levels of capital and
liquidity, or absorb increased capital and
liquidity costs
• incur higher operational and compliance costs
• change the prices that it charges for its
products and services
• curtail the products and services that it
offers to its customers and clients
• curtail other business opportunities,
including acquisitions or principal investments,
that it otherwise would have pursued
• become subject to regulatory fines, penalties
or other sanctions, or
• incur higher costs for complying with
different legal and regulatory frameworks.
Any or all of these factors could harm
JPMorganChase’s ability to compete against other
firms that are not subject to the same laws,
rules and regulations or supervisory oversight,
or harm JPMorganChase’s businesses, results of
operations and profitability.
Resolving regulatory investigations can subject
JPMorganChase to significant penalties and
collateral consequences, and could result in
higher compliance costs or restrictions on its
operations.
JPMorganChase is subject to heightened oversight
and scrutiny from regulatory authorities in many
jurisdictions. JPMorganChase has paid
significant fines, provided other monetary
relief, incurred other
 12 
penalties and experienced other repercussions in
connection with resolving investigations and
enforcement actions by governmental agencies.
JPMorganChase could become subject to similar
regulatory or governmental resolutions or other
actions in the future, and addressing the
requirements of any such resolutions or actions
could result in JPMorganChase incurring higher
operational and compliance costs, including
devoting substantial resources to the required
remediation or needing to comply with other
restrictions.
In connection with resolving specific regulatory
investigations or enforcement actions, certain
regulators have required JPMorganChase and other
financial institutions to admit wrongdoing with
respect to the activities that gave rise to the
resolution. These types of admissions can lead
to:
• greater exposure in litigation
• damage to JPMorganChase’s reputation
• disqualification from doing business with
certain clients or customers, or in specific
jurisdictions, or
• other direct and indirect adverse effects.
Furthermore, government officials in the U.S.
and other countries have demonstrated a
willingness to bring criminal actions against
financial institutions and have required that
institutions plead guilty to criminal offenses
or admit other wrongdoing in connection with
resolving regulatory investigations or
enforcement actions. Resolutions of this type
can have significant collateral consequences for
the subject financial institution, including:
• loss of clients, customers and business
• restrictions on offering certain products or
services, and
• losing permission to operate certain
businesses, either temporarily or permanently.
JPMorganChase expects that:
• it and other financial services firms will
continue to be subject to heightened regulatory
scrutiny and governmental investigations and
enforcement actions
• governmental authorities will continue to
require that financial institutions be penalized
for actual or deemed violations of law with
formal and punitive enforcement actions,
including the imposition of significant monetary
and other sanctions, rather than resolving these
matters through informal supervisory actions,
and
• governmental authorities will be more likely
to pursue formal enforcement actions and
resolutions against JPMorganChase to the extent
that it has previously been subject to other
governmental investigations or enforcement
actions.
If JPMorganChase fails to meet the requirements
of any resolution of a governmental
investigation or enforcement action, or to
maintain risk and control processes that meet
the heightened standards and expectations of its
regulators, it could be required to, among other
things:
• enter into further resolutions of
investigations or enforcement actions
• pay additional regulatory penalties or enter
into judgments, or
• accept material regulatory restrictions on, or
changes in the management of, its businesses.
In these circumstances, JPMorganChase could also
become subject to other sanctions, or to
prosecution or civil litigation with respect to
the conduct that gave rise to an investigation
or enforcement action. In addition,
JPMorganChase can be subject to higher costs or
requests for additional capital in connection
with the resolution of governmental
investigations and enforcement actions involving
newly-acquired businesses, companies in which
JPMorganChase has made principal investments,
parties to joint ventures with JPMorganChase,
and vendors with which JPMorganChase does
business.
JPMorganChase’s operations and financial results
can be negatively impacted in jurisdictions with
less predictable legal and regulatory frameworks
.
JPMorganChase conducts existing and new business
in certain countries, states, municipalities,
territories and other jurisdictions in which the
application of the rule of law is inconsistent,
extralegal or less predictable, including with
respect to:
• the absence of a statutory or regulatory basis
or guidance for engaging in specific types of
business or transactions
• conflicting or ambiguous laws, rules,
regulations and judicial orders, or the
inconsistent application or interpretation of
existing laws, rules, regulations and judicial
precedents
• actions by or at the direction of government
officials or agencies
• uncertainty concerning the enforceability of
intellectual property rights or contractual or
other obligations
• difficulty in competing in economies in which
the government controls or protects all or a
portion of the local economy or specific
businesses, or where graft or corruption may be
pervasive
• the threat of regulatory investigations, civil
litigations or criminal prosecutions that are
arbitrary or otherwise contrary to established
legal principles in other parts of the world,
and
 13 
║ Part I ║
• the termination of licenses required to
operate in the local market or the suspension of
business relationships with governmental bodies.
If the application of the laws, rules,
regulations and judicial precedents in any
jurisdiction is susceptible to producing
outcomes that are inconsistent, unexpected or
contrary to established legal principles, this
can create a more difficult environment in which
JPMorganChase conducts its business and could
negatively affect JPMorganChase’s operations and
reduce its earnings with respect to that
jurisdiction. For example, JPMorganChase has
faced actual and threatened litigation in Russia
with respect to payments that JPMorganChase
cannot make under, and is contractually excused
from paying as a result of, relevant economic
sanctions laws. That litigation has also
resulted in the seizure of assets. In addition,
conducting business in jurisdictions with less
predictable legal and regulatory frameworks
could require JPMorganChase to devote
significant additional resources to
understanding local laws, rules and regulations,
as well as structuring its operations to comply
with local laws, rules and regulations and
implementing and administering related internal
policies and procedures.
There can be no assurance that JPMorganChase
will always be successful in its efforts to
fully understand and to conduct its business in
compliance with the laws, rules and regulations
of all of the jurisdictions in which it
operates, and the risk of non-compliance, or of
interference with JPMorganChase's businesses,
can be greater in jurisdictions that have less
predictable legal and regulatory frameworks.
JPMorganChase's businesses may be negatively
impacted by governmental policies that either
discourage or penalize business with certain
industries or require specific business
practices.
JPMorganChase's businesses and results of
operations may be adversely affected by actions
or initiatives by national, state or local
governmental authorities that:
• seek to discourage financial institutions from
doing business with companies engaged in certain
industries, or conversely, to penalize financial
institutions that elect not to do business with
such companies, or
• mandate specific business practices that
companies operating in the relevant jurisdiction
must adopt.
Because governmental policies in one
jurisdiction may differ or conflict with those
in other jurisdictions, JPMorganChase may face
negative consequences regardless of the course
of action it takes or elects not to take,
including:
• restrictions or prohibitions on doing business
within a particular jurisdiction, or with
governmental entities in a jurisdiction
• the threat of enforcement actions, including
under antitrust or other anti-competition laws,
rules and regulations, and
• harm to its reputation arising from public
criticism, including from politicians, activists
and other stakeholders.
JPMorganChase has been prohibited from engaging
in certain business activities in specific
jurisdictions as a result of these types of
governmental actions, and there is no assurance
that it will not face similar restrictions on
its business and operations in the future.
Requirements for the orderly resolution of
JPMorganChase could result in JPMorganChase
having to restructure or reorganize its
businesses and could increase its funding or
operational costs or curtail its businesses.
JPMorganChase is required under Federal Reserve
and FDIC rules to prepare and submit
periodically to those agencies a detailed plan
for rapid and orderly resolution in bankruptcy,
without extraordinary government support, in the
event of material financial distress or failure.
The evaluation of JPMorganChase’s resolution
plan by these agencies may change, and the
requirements for resolution plans may be
modified from time to time. Any such
determinations or modifications could result in
JPMorganChase needing to make changes to its
legal entity structure or to certain internal or
external activities, which could increase its
funding or operational costs, or hamper its
ability to serve clients and customers.
If the Federal Reserve and the FDIC were both to
determine that a resolution plan submitted by
JPMorganChase has deficiencies, they could
jointly impose more stringent capital, leverage
or liquidity requirements or restrictions on
JPMorganChase’s growth, activities or
operations. The agencies could also require that
JPMorganChase restructure, reorganize or divest
assets or businesses in ways that could
materially and adversely affect JPMorganChase’s
operations and strategy.
Holders of JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s debt and
equity securities will absorb losses if it were
to enter into a resolution.
Federal Reserve rules require that JPMorgan
Chase & Co. (the “Parent Company”) maintain
minimum levels of unsecured external long-term
debt and other loss-absorbing capacity with
specific terms (“eligible LTD”) for purposes of
recapitalizing JPMorganChase’s operating
subsidiaries if the Parent Company were to enter
into a resolution either:
• in a bankruptcy proceeding under Chapter 11 of
the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, or
• in a receivership administered by the FDIC
under Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act (“Title
II”).
 14 
If the Parent Company were to enter into a
resolution, holders of eligible LTD, other
unsecured creditors and holders of equity
securities of the Parent Company will absorb the
losses of the Parent Company and its
subsidiaries.
The preferred “single point of entry” strategy
under JPMorganChase’s resolution plan
contemplates that the Parent Company would enter
bankruptcy proceedings and JPMorganChase’s
material subsidiaries would be recapitalized, as
needed, so that they could continue normal
operations or subsequently be divested or wound
down in an orderly manner. As a result, the
Parent Company’s losses and any losses incurred
by its subsidiaries would be imposed first on
holders of the Parent Company’s equity
securities and thereafter on its unsecured
creditors, including holders of eligible LTD.
Claims of the Parent Company's shareholders and
unsecured creditors would have a junior position
to the claims of creditors of JPMorganChase’s
subsidiaries and to the claims of priority (as
determined by statute) and secured creditors of
the Parent Company.
Accordingly, in a resolution of the Parent
Company in bankruptcy, unsecured creditors of
the Parent Company, including holders of
eligible LTD of the Parent Company, would
realize value only to the extent available to
the Parent Company as a shareholder of JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A. and its other subsidiaries, and
only after any claims of priority and secured
creditors of the Parent Company have been fully
repaid.
The FDIC has similarly indicated that a single
point of entry recapitalization model would be
its expected strategy to resolve a systemically
important financial institution, such as the
Parent Company, under Title II. However, the
FDIC has not formally adopted or committed to
any specific resolution strategy.
If the Parent Company were to approach, or enter
into, a resolution, none of the Parent Company,
the Federal Reserve or the FDIC is obligated to
follow JPMorganChase’s preferred resolution
strategy, and losses to unsecured creditors of
the Parent Company, including holders of
eligible LTD, and to holders of equity
securities of the Parent Company, under whatever
strategy is ultimately followed, could be
greater than they might have been under
JPMorganChase’s preferred strategy.
 Political 
Economic uncertainty or instability caused by
political and geopolitical developments can
negatively impact JPMorganChase’s businesses.
Political developments in the U.S. and other
countries can cause uncertainty in the economic
environment and market conditions in which
JPMorganChase operates its businesses. Certain
governmental policy initiatives, as well as
heightened geopolitical tensions,
could significantly affect U.S. and global
economic growth and cause higher volatility in
the financial markets, including:
• monetary policies and actions taken by the
Federal Reserve and other central banks or
governmental authorities, including changes in
interest rate levels and any sustained large-
scale asset purchases or any suspension or
reversal of those actions
• fiscal policies, including with respect to
taxation and spending
• isolationist foreign policies
• economic or financial sanctions
• the implementation of tariffs and other
protectionist trade policies
• changes to immigration policies, or
• actions that the government takes or fails to
take in response to the effects of health
emergencies, the spread of infectious diseases,
epidemics or pandemics.
These types of political developments, and
uncertainty about the possible outcomes of these
developments, could:
• erode investor or consumer confidence in the
U.S. economy and financial markets, which could
potentially undermine the status of the U.S.
dollar as a safe haven currency
• provoke retaliatory countermeasures by other
countries and otherwise heighten tensions in
regulatory, enforcement or diplomatic relations
• increase the risk of targeted cyber attacks
• increase concerns about whether the U.S.
government will be funded, and its outstanding
debt serviced, at any particular time
• result in periodic shutdowns of the U.S.
government
• influence investor perceptions concerning
government support of certain sectors of the
economy or the economy as a whole
• influence monetary policy actions of the
Federal Reserve to moderate the economic impact
of political developments, including decisions
on interest rate levels and asset purchases and
sales
• adversely affect the financial condition or
credit ratings of clients and counterparties
with which JPMorganChase does business, or
• cause JPMorganChase to refrain from engaging
in business opportunities that it might
otherwise pursue.
These factors could lead to:
• slower growth rates, rising inflation or
recession
• disruptions in labor markets
• greater market volatility
 15 
║ Part I ║
• a contraction of available credit and the
widening of credit spreads
• U.S. dollar currency fluctuations
• lower investments in a particular country or
sector of the economy
• large-scale sales of government debt and other
debt and equity securities
• reduced commercial activity among trading
partners or disruptions to supply chains, or
• the possible departure of a country from, or
the dissolution or formation of, a political or
economic alliance or treaty.
Under certain circumstances, such as
geopolitically challenging situations in regions
like Russia, the Middle East and China, these
various risks could become highly correlated or
combine in unprecedented ways.
Any of these potential outcomes could cause
JPMorganChase to suffer losses on its market-
making positions or in its investment portfolio,
reduce its liquidity and capital levels,
increase the allowance for credit losses or lead
to higher net charge-offs, hamper its ability to
deliver products and services to its clients and
customers, and weaken its results of operations
and financial condition or credit rating.
 Market 
Economic and market events and conditions can
materially affect JPMorganChase’s businesses and
investment and market-making positions.
JPMorganChase’s results of operations can be
negatively affected by adverse changes in any of
the following:
• investor, consumer and business sentiment
• events that reduce confidence in the financial
markets
• inflation, deflation or recession
• high unemployment or, conversely, a tightening
labor market
• the availability and cost of capital,
liquidity and credit
• levels and volatility of interest rates,
credit spreads and market prices for currencies,
debt and equity securities and commodities, as
well as the duration of any such changes
• the economic effects of an outbreak or
escalation of war, hostilities, terrorism or
other geopolitical instabilities, cyber attacks,
climate change, natural disasters, severe
weather conditions, health emergencies, the
spread of infectious diseases, epidemics or
pandemics or other extraordinary events beyond
JPMorganChase’s control, and
• the state of the U.S. and global economies.
All of these are affected by global economic,
market and political events and conditions,
including monetary policies and actions taken by
central banks or other governmental authorities,
as well as by the regulatory environment.
In addition, JPMorganChase’s investment
portfolio and market-making businesses can
suffer losses due to unanticipated market
events, including:
• severe declines in asset values
• unexpected credit events
• unforeseen events or conditions that may cause
previously uncorrelated factors to become
correlated (and vice versa)
• the inability to effectively hedge risks
related to market-making and investment
portfolio positions, or
• other market risks that may not have been
appropriately taken into account in the
development, structuring or pricing of a
financial instrument.
If JPMorganChase experiences significant losses
in its investment portfolio or from market-
making activities, this could reduce
JPMorganChase’s profitability and its liquidity
and capital levels, and thereby constrain the
growth of its businesses.
JPMorganChase’s consumer businesses can be
negatively affected by adverse economic
conditions and governmental policies.
JPMorganChase’s consumer businesses are
particularly affected by U.S. and global
economic conditions, including:
• personal and household income distribution
• unemployment or underemployment
• prolonged periods of exceptionally high or low
interest rates, or significant changes to
interest rates
• changes in the value of collateral such as
residential real estate and vehicles
• changes in housing prices
• the level of inflation and its effect on
prices for goods and services
• consumer and small business confidence levels,
and
• changes in consumer spending or in the level
of consumer debt.
Heightened levels of unemployment or
underemployment that result in reduced personal
and household income could negatively affect
consumer credit performance to the extent that
consumers are less able to service their debts.
In addition, sustained low growth, low or
negative interest rates, inflationary pressures
or recessionary conditions could diminish
customer demand for the products and services
offered by JPMorganChase’s consumer businesses.
 16 
Adverse economic conditions could also lead to
an increase in delinquencies, additions to the
allowance for credit losses and higher net
charge-offs, which can reduce JPMorganChase’s
earnings. These consequences could be
significantly worse in certain geographies,
including where declining industrial or
manufacturing activity has resulted in or could
result in higher levels of unemployment, or
where high levels of consumer debt, such as
outstanding student loans, could impair the
ability of customers to pay their other consumer
loan obligations.
JPMorganChase’s earnings from its consumer
businesses could also be adversely affected by
governmental policies and actions that affect
consumers, including:
• policies and initiatives relating to medical
insurance, education, immigration and housing,
or that may impact employment status
• laws, rules and regulations relating
specifically to the financial services industry,
such as limitations on late payment, overdraft
and interchange fees, and
• policies aimed at the economy more broadly,
such as higher taxes and increased regulation,
which could result in reductions in consumer
disposable income.
Unfavorable market and economic conditions can
have an adverse effect on JPMorganChase’s
wholesale businesses.
In JPMorganChase’s wholesale businesses, market
and economic factors can affect the volume of
transactions that JPMorganChase executes for its
clients or for which it advises clients, and,
therefore, the revenue that JPMorganChase
receives from those transactions. These factors
can also influence the willingness of other
financial institutions and investors to
participate in capital markets transactions that
JPMorganChase manages, such as loan syndications
or securities underwriting. Furthermore, if a
significant and sustained deterioration in
market conditions were to occur, the
profitability of JPMorganChase’s businesses
engaged in capital markets activities, including
loan syndication, securities underwriting and
leveraged lending activities, could be reduced
to the extent that those businesses:
• earn less fee revenue due to lower transaction
volumes, including when clients are unwilling or
unable to refinance their outstanding debt
obligations in unfavorable market conditions, or
• dispose of portions of credit commitments at a
loss, or hold larger residual positions in
credit commitments that cannot be sold at
favorable prices.
The fees that JPMorganChase earns from managing
client assets or holding assets under custody
for clients could be diminished by declining
asset values
or other adverse macroeconomic conditions. For
example, higher interest rates or a downturn in
financial markets could affect the valuation of
client assets that JPMorganChase manages or
holds under custody, which, in turn, could
affect JPMorganChase’s revenue from fees that
are based on the amount of assets under
management or custody. Similarly, adverse
macroeconomic or market conditions could prompt
outflows from JPMorganChase funds or accounts,
or cause clients to invest in products that
generate lower revenue. Substantial and
unexpected withdrawals from a JPMorganChase fund
can also hamper the investment performance of
the fund, particularly if the outflows create
the need for the fund to dispose of fund assets
at disadvantageous times or prices, and could
lead to further withdrawals based on the weaker
investment performance.
An adverse change in market conditions in
particular segments of the economy, such as a
sudden and severe downturn in oil and gas prices
or an increase in commodity prices, severe
declines in commercial real estate values, or
sustained changes in consumer behavior that
affect specific economic sectors, could have a
material adverse effect on clients of
JPMorganChase whose operations or financial
condition are directly or indirectly dependent
on the health or stability of those market
segments or economic sectors, as well as clients
that are engaged in related businesses.
JPMorganChase could incur credit losses on its
loans and other commitments to clients that
operate in, or are dependent on, any sector of
the economy that is or comes under stress.
An economic downturn or sustained changes in
consumer behavior that results in shifts in
consumer and business spending could also have a
negative impact on certain of JPMorganChase’s
wholesale clients, and thereby diminish
JPMorganChase’s earnings from its wholesale
operations. For example, the businesses of
certain of JPMorganChase’s wholesale clients are
dependent on consistent streams of rental income
from commercial real estate properties,
including offices, which are owned or being
built by those clients. Sustained adverse
economic conditions or hybrid work models could
result in reductions in the rental cash flows
that owners or developers receive from their
tenants which, in turn, could depress the values
of the properties, impair the ability of
borrowers to service or refinance their
commercial real estate loans and lead to an
increase in foreclosures. These consequences
could result in JPMorganChase experiencing
increases in the allowance for credit losses,
higher delinquencies, defaults and charge-offs
within its commercial real estate loan portfolio
and incurring higher costs for servicing a
larger volume of delinquent loans in that
portfolio. An increase in foreclosures could
result in higher operational risk associated
with JPMorganChase owning and managing real
property,
 17 
║ Part I ║
and any inadequacy in governance or control over
the foreclosed properties could result in
regulatory scrutiny and reputational harm.
Changes in interest rates and credit spreads can
adversely affect JPMorganChase’s earnings, its
liquidity or its capital levels.
When interest rates are high or increasing,
JPMorganChase can generally be expected to earn
higher net interest income. However, higher
interest rates can also lead to:
• fewer originations of commercial and
residential real estate loans
• losses on underwriting exposures or
incremental client-specific downgrades, or
increases in the allowance for credit losses and
net charge-offs due to higher financing costs
for clients
• the loss of deposits, particularly if
customers withdraw deposits because they believe
that interest rates offered by JPMorganChase are
lower than those of competitors or if
JPMorganChase makes incorrect assumptions about
depositor behavior
• losses on available-for-sale (“AFS”)
securities held in the investment securities
portfolio
• lower net interest income if central banks
introduce interest rate increases more quickly
than anticipated and this results in a
misalignment in the pricing of short-term and
long-term borrowings
• less liquidity in the financial markets, and
• higher funding costs.
All of these outcomes could adversely affect
JPMorganChase’s earnings or its liquidity and
capital levels, and any negative outcomes could
be more severe in a prolonged period of high
interest rates. Higher interest rates can also
negatively affect the payment performance on
loans within JPMorganChase’s consumer and
wholesale loan portfolios that are linked to
variable interest rates. If borrowers of
variable rate loans are unable to afford higher
interest payments, those borrowers may reduce or
stop making payments, thereby causing
JPMorganChase to incur losses and increased
operational costs related to servicing a higher
volume of delinquent loans.
On the other hand, a low or negative interest
rate environment may cause:
• net interest margins to be compressed, which
could reduce the amounts that JPMorganChase
earns on its investment securities portfolio to
the extent that it is unable to reinvest
contemporaneously in higher-yielding instruments
• unanticipated or adverse changes in depositor
behavior, which could negatively affect
JPMorganChase’s broader asset and liability
management strategy, and
• a reduction in the value of JPMorganChase’s
mortgage servicing rights (“MSRs”) asset,
resulting in decreased revenues.
When credit spreads widen, it becomes more
expensive for JPMorganChase to borrow.
JPMorganChase’s credit spreads may widen or
narrow not only in response to events and
circumstances that are specific to JPMorganChase
but also as a result of general economic and
geopolitical events and conditions. Changes in
JPMorganChase’s credit spreads will affect,
positively or negatively, JPMorganChase’s
earnings on certain liabilities, such as
derivatives, that are recorded at fair value.
JPMorganChase’s results may be materially
affected by market fluctuations and significant
changes in the valuation of financial
instruments.
The value of securities, derivatives and other
financial instruments which JPMorganChase owns
or in which it makes markets can be materially
affected by market fluctuations. Market
volatility, illiquid market conditions and other
disruptions in the financial markets may make it
extremely difficult to value certain financial
instruments. Subsequent valuations of financial
instruments in future periods, in light of
factors then prevailing, may result in
significant changes in the value of these
instruments. In addition, at the time of any
disposition of these financial instruments, the
price that JPMorganChase ultimately realizes
will depend on the demand and liquidity in the
market at that time and may be materially lower
than their current fair value. Any of these
factors could cause a decline in the value of
financial instruments that JPMorganChase owns or
in which it makes markets, which may have an
adverse effect on JPMorganChase’s results of
operations.
JPMorganChase’s risk management and monitoring
processes, including its stress testing
framework, seek to quantify and manage
JPMorganChase’s exposure to more extreme market
moves. However, JPMorganChase’s hedging and
other risk management strategies may not be
effective, and it could incur significant
losses, if extreme market events were to occur.
 Credit 
JPMorganChase can be negatively affected by
adverse changes in the financial condition of
clients, counterparties, custodians and CCPs.
JPMorganChase routinely executes transactions
with clients and counterparties such as
corporations, financial institutions, asset
managers, hedge funds, securities exchanges and
government entities within and outside the U.S.
Many of these transactions expose JPMorganChase
to the credit risk of its clients and
counterparties, and can involve JPMorganChase in
disputes and litigation if a client or
counterparty defaults. JPMorganChase can also be
subject to losses
 18 
or liability where a financial institution that
it has appointed to provide custodial services
for client assets or funds becomes insolvent as
a result of fraud or the failure to abide by
existing laws and obligations, or where clients
are unable to access assets held by
JPMorganChase as custodian due to governmental
actions or other factors.
A default by, or the financial or operational
failure of, a CCP through which JPMorganChase
executes contracts would require JPMorganChase
to replace those contracts, thereby increasing
its operational costs and potentially resulting
in losses. In addition, JPMorganChase can be
exposed to losses if a member of a CCP in which
JPMorganChase is also a member defaults on its
obligations to the CCP because of requirements
that each member of the CCP absorb a portion of
those losses. Furthermore, JPMorganChase can be
subject to bearing its share of non-default
losses incurred by a CCP, including losses from
custodial, settlement or investment activities
or due to cyber or other security breaches.
As part of its clearing services activities,
JPMorganChase is exposed to the risk of
nonperformance by its clients, which it seeks to
mitigate by requiring clients to provide
adequate collateral. JPMorganChase is also
exposed to intra-day credit risk of its clients
in connection with providing cash management,
clearing, custodial and other transaction
services to those clients. If a client for which
JPMorganChase provides these services becomes
bankrupt or insolvent, JPMorganChase may incur
losses, become involved in disputes and
litigation with one or more CCPs, the client’s
bankruptcy estate and other creditors, or be
subject to regulatory investigations. All of the
foregoing events can increase JPMorganChase’s
operational and litigation costs, and
JPMorganChase may suffer losses to the extent
that any collateral that it has received is
insufficient to cover those losses.
Transactions with government entities, including
national, state, provincial, municipal and local
authorities, can expose JPMorganChase to
enhanced sovereign, credit, operational and
reputation risks. Government entities may, among
other things, claim that actions taken by
government officials were beyond the legal
authority of those officials or repudiate
transactions authorized by a previous incumbent
government. These types of actions have in the
past caused, and could in the future cause,
JPMorganChase to suffer losses or hamper its
ability to conduct business in the relevant
jurisdiction.
In addition, local laws, rules and regulations
could limit JPMorganChase’s ability to resolve
disputes and litigation in the event of a
counterparty default or unwillingness to make
previously agreed-upon payments, which could
subject JPMorganChase to losses.
Disputes may arise with counterparties to
derivatives contracts with regard to the terms,
the settlement procedures or the value of
underlying collateral. The disposition of those
disputes could cause JPMorganChase to incur
unexpected transaction, operational and legal
costs, or result in credit losses. These
consequences can also impair JPMorganChase’s
ability to effectively manage its credit risk
exposure from its market activities, or cause
harm to JPMorganChase’s reputation.
The financial or operational failure of a
significant market participant, such as a major
financial institution or a CCP, or concerns
about the creditworthiness of such a market
participant or its ability to fulfill its
obligations, can cause substantial and cascading
disruption within the financial markets,
including in circumstances where coordinated
action by multiple other market participants is
required to address the failure or disruption.
JPMorganChase’s businesses could be
significantly disrupted by such an event,
particularly if it leads to other market
participants incurring significant losses,
experiencing liquidity issues or defaulting, and
JPMorganChase is likely to have significant
interrelationships with, and credit exposure to,
such a significant market participant.
JPMorganChase may suffer losses if the value of
collateral declines in stressed market
conditions.
During periods of market stress or illiquidity,
JPMorganChase’s credit risk may be further
increased when:
• JPMorganChase fails to realize the estimated
value of the collateral it holds
• collateral is liquidated at prices that are
not sufficient to recover the full amount owed
to it, or
• counterparties are unable to post collateral,
whether for operational or other reasons.
Furthermore, disputes with counterparties
concerning the valuation of collateral may
increase in times of significant market stress,
volatility or illiquidity, and JPMorganChase
could suffer losses during these periods if it
is unable to realize the fair value of
collateral or to manage declines in the value of
collateral.
JPMorganChase could incur significant losses
arising from concentrations of credit and market
risk.
JPMorganChase is exposed to greater credit and
market risk to the extent that groupings of its
clients or counterparties, or obligors on
securities and other financial instruments:
• engage in similar or related businesses, or in
businesses in related industries
• do business in the same geographic region, or
 19 
║ Part I ║
• have business profiles, models or strategies
that could cause their ability to meet their
obligations to be similarly affected by changes
in economic conditions.
For example, a significant deterioration in the
credit quality of a counterparty, borrower or
other obligor could lead to concerns about the
creditworthiness of other counterparties,
borrowers or obligors in similar, related or
dependent industries. This type of
interrelationship could exacerbate
JPMorganChase’s credit, liquidity and market
risk exposure and potentially cause it to incur
losses, including fair value losses in its
market-making businesses and investment
portfolios. In addition, JPMorganChase may be
required to increase the allowance for credit
losses or establish other reserves with respect
to certain clients, industries or country
exposures in order to align with directives or
expectations of its banking regulators.
Similarly, challenging economic conditions that
affect a particular industry or geographic area
could lead to concerns about the credit quality
of counterparties, borrowers or other obligors
not only in that particular industry or
geography but in related or dependent
industries, wherever located. These conditions
could also heighten concerns about the ability
of customers of JPMorganChase’s consumer
businesses who live in those areas or work in
those affected industries or related or
dependent industries to meet their obligations
to JPMorganChase. JPMorganChase regularly
monitors various segments of its credit and
market risk exposures to assess the potential
risks of concentration or contagion, but its
ability to diversify or hedge its exposure
against those risks may be limited.
JPMorganChase’s consumer businesses can also be
harmed by an excessive expansion of consumer
credit by bank or non-bank competitors.
Heightened competition for certain types of
consumer loans could prompt industry-wide
reactions such as significant reductions in the
pricing or margins of those loans or the making
of loans to less-creditworthy borrowers. If
large numbers of consumers subsequently default
on their loans, whether due to weak credit
profiles, an economic downturn or other factors,
this could impair their ability to repay
obligations owed to JPMorganChase and result in
higher charge-offs and other credit-related
losses. More broadly, widespread defaults on
consumer debt could lead to recessionary
conditions in the U.S. economy, and
JPMorganChase’s consumer businesses may earn
lower revenues in such an environment.
If JPMorganChase is unable to reduce positions
effectively during a market dislocation, this
can increase both the market and credit risks
associated with those positions and the level of
risk-weighted-assets (“RWA”) that JPMorganChase
holds on its
balance sheet. These factors could adversely
affect JPMorganChase’s capital position, funding
costs and the profitability of its businesses.
 Liquidity 
JPMorganChase’s ability to operate its
businesses could be impaired if its liquidity is
constrained.
JPMorganChase’s liquidity can be impacted at any
given time as a result of factors such as:
• market-wide illiquidity or disruption
• changes in liquidity or capital requirements
resulting from changes in laws, rules and
regulations, including those in response to
economic effects of systemic events
• actions taken by the U.S. government or by the
Federal Reserve to reduce its balance sheet,
which may reduce deposits held by JPMorganChase
and other financial institutions
• inability to sell assets, or to sell assets at
favorable times or prices
• default by a CCP or other significant market
participant
• unanticipated outflows of cash or collateral
• unexpected loss of deposits or higher than
anticipated draws on lending-related
commitments, and
• lack of market or customer confidence in
JPMorganChase or financial institutions in
general.
A reduction in JPMorganChase’s liquidity may be
caused by events over which it has little or no
control. For example, periods of market stress,
low investor confidence and significant market
illiquidity could result in higher funding costs
for JPMorganChase and could limit its access to
some of its traditional sources of liquidity.
JPMorganChase may need to raise funding from
alternative sources if its access to stable and
lower-cost sources of funding, such as deposits
and borrowings from Federal Home Loan Banks, is
reduced. Alternative sources of funding could be
more expensive or limited in availability.
JPMorganChase’s funding costs could also be
negatively affected by actions that
JPMorganChase may take in order to:
• satisfy applicable liquidity coverage ratio
and net stable funding ratio requirements
• address obligations under its resolution plan,
or
• satisfy regulatory requirements in
jurisdictions outside the U.S. relating to the
pre-positioning of liquidity in subsidiaries
that are material legal entities.
More generally, if JPMorganChase fails to
effectively manage its liquidity, this could
constrain its ability to fund or invest in its
businesses and subsidiaries, and thereby
adversely affect its results of operations.
 20 
JPMorgan Chase & Co. is a holding company and
depends on the cash flows of its subsidiaries to
make payments on its outstanding securities.
JPMorgan Chase & Co. is a holding company that
holds the stock of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and
an intermediate holding company, JPMorgan Chase
Holdings LLC (the “IHC”). The IHC in turn
generally holds the stock of JPMorganChase’s
subsidiaries other than JPMorgan Chase Bank,
N.A. and its subsidiaries. The IHC also owns
other assets and provides intercompany lending
to the Parent Company.
The Parent Company is obligated to contribute to
the IHC substantially all the net proceeds
received from securities issuances (including
issuances of senior and subordinated debt
securities and of preferred and common stock).
The ability of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the
IHC to make payments to the Parent Company is
also limited. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is
subject to regulatory restrictions on its
dividend distributions, as well as capital
adequacy requirements, such as the Supplementary
Leverage Ratio (“SLR”), and liquidity
requirements and other regulatory restrictions
on its ability to make payments to the Parent
Company. The IHC is prohibited from paying
dividends or extending credit to the Parent
Company if certain capital or liquidity
thresholds are breached, or if limits are
otherwise imposed by the Parent Company’s
management or Board of Directors.
As a result of these arrangements, the ability
of the Parent Company to make various payments
is dependent on its receiving dividends from
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and dividends and
borrowings from the IHC. These limitations could
affect the Parent Company’s ability to:
• pay interest on its debt securities
• pay dividends on its equity securities
• redeem or repurchase outstanding securities,
and
• fulfill its other payment obligations.
These arrangements could also result in the
Parent Company seeking protection under
bankruptcy laws or otherwise entering into
resolution proceedings at a time earlier than
would have been the case absent the existence of
the capital and liquidity thresholds to which
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the IHC are
subject.
Reductions in JPMorganChase’s credit ratings may
adversely affect its liquidity and cost of
funding.
JPMorgan Chase & Co. and certain of its
principal subsidiaries are rated by credit
rating agencies. Rating agencies evaluate
general, firm-specific and industry-specific
factors when determining credit ratings for a
particular financial institution, including:
• expected future profitability
• risk management practices
• legal expenses
• ratings differentials between bank holding
companies and their bank and non-bank
subsidiaries
• regulatory developments
• assumptions about government support, and
• economic and geopolitical developments.
JPMorganChase closely monitors and manages, to
the extent that it is able, factors that could
influence its credit ratings. However, there is
no assurance that JPMorganChase’s credit ratings
will not be downgraded in the future.
Furthermore, any such downgrade could occur at
times of broader market instability when
JPMorganChase’s options for responding to events
may be more limited and general investor
confidence is low.
A reduction in JPMorganChase’s credit ratings
could curtail JPMorganChase’s business
activities and reduce its profitability in a
number of ways, including:
• reducing its access to capital markets
• materially increasing its cost of issuing and
servicing securities
• triggering additional collateral or funding
requirements, and
• decreasing the number of investors and
counterparties that are willing or permitted to
do business with or lend to JPMorganChase.
Any rating reduction could also increase the
credit spreads charged by the market for taking
credit risk on JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its
subsidiaries. This could, in turn, adversely
affect the value of debt and other obligations
of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries.
 Capital 
Maintaining the required level and composition
of capital may impact JPMorganChase’s ability to
support business activities, meet evolving
regulatory requirements and distribute capital
to shareholders.
JPMorganChase is subject to various regulatory
capital requirements, including leverage- and
risk-based capital requirements. In addition, as
a Global Systemically Important Bank (“GSIB”),
JPMorganChase is required to hold additional
capital buffers, including a GSIB surcharge, a
Stress Capital Buffer (“SCB”), and a
countercyclical buffer, each of which is
reassessed at least annually. The amount of
capital that JPMorganChase is required to hold
in order to satisfy these leverage- and risk-
based requirements could increase at any given
time due to factors such as:
• actions by banking regulators, including
changes in laws, rules and regulations
 21 
║ Part I ║
• changes in the composition of JPMorganChase’s
balance sheet or developments that could
increase RWA, such as increased market risk,
customer delinquencies, client credit rating
downgrades or other factors, and
• increases in estimated stress losses as
determined by the Federal Reserve under the
Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, which
could increase JPMorganChase’s SCB.
Any failure by or inability of JPMorganChase to
maintain the required level and composition of
capital, or unfavorable changes in applicable
capital requirements, could have an adverse
impact on JPMorganChase’s shareholders, such as:
• reducing the amount of common stock that
JPMorganChase is permitted to repurchase
• requiring the issuance of, or prohibiting the
redemption of, capital instruments in a manner
inconsistent with JPMorganChase’s capital
management strategy
• constraining the amount of dividends that may
be paid on common stock, or
• curtailing JPMorganChase’s business activities
or operations.
In 2023, U.S. banking regulators released a
proposal to implement the final Basel III
reforms which would have significantly revised
the risk-based capital requirements for banks
with assets of $100 billion or more, including
JPMorganChase. In addition, in 2023 the Federal
Reserve released a proposal to amend the
calculation of the GSIB surcharge. Uncertainty
remains regarding the content of the final
versions of these rule proposals and how they
might ultimately apply to JPMorganChase.
However, it is possible that the final rules
could impact JPMorganChase’s decisions
concerning the business activities in which it
will engage and its levels of capital
distributions to its shareholders.
 Operational 
JPMorganChase’s businesses are dependent on the
effectiveness of internal and external
operational systems.
JPMorganChase’s businesses rely on the ability
of JPMorganChase’s financial, accounting,
transaction execution, data processing and other
operational systems, including devices
supporting those systems, to process, record,
monitor and report a large number of
transactions on a continuous basis, and to do so
accurately, quickly and securely. In addition to
proper design, installation, maintenance and
training, the effective functioning of
JPMorganChase’s operational systems depends on:
• the quality of the information contained in
those systems, as inaccurate, outdated,
incomplete or corrupted data can significantly
compromise the
functionality or reliability of a particular
system and other systems to which it transmits
or from which it receives information, and
• JPMorganChase’s ability to continue to
maintain and upgrade its systems on a regular
and timely basis in line with technological
advancements and evolving security requirements,
maintain security and operational continuity of
its systems, including by carefully managing any
changes introduced to its systems, prevent
unauthorized access and the misuse of access to
its systems, and adhere to all applicable legal
and regulatory requirements, particularly in
regions where JPMorganChase may face a
heightened risk of malicious activity.
JPMorganChase has experienced and expects that
it will continue to experience failures and
disruptions in the stability of its operational
systems, including degraded performance of data
processing systems, data quality issues,
disruptions of network connectivity and
malfunctioning software, as well as disruptions
in its ability to access and use the operational
systems of third parties and interruptions in
service from third-party service providers.
These incidents have resulted in various
negative effects for customers, including the
inability to access account information or
transact through ATM, internet or mobile
channels, the exfiltration of customer personal
data, the recording of duplicative transactions
and extended delays for customers requiring
services from call centers. There can be no
assurance that these and other types of
operational failures or disruptions will not
occur in the future.
JPMorganChase’s ability to effectively manage
the stability of its operational systems and
infrastructure could be hindered by many
factors, any of which could have a negative
impact on JPMorganChase and its clients,
customers and counterparties, including:
• JPMorganChase’s ability to effectively
maintain and upgrade systems and infrastructure
can become more challenging as the speed,
frequency, volume, interconnectivity and
complexity of transactions continue to increase
• attempts by third parties to defraud
JPMorganChase or its clients and customers
continue to increase, evolve and become more
complex, and during periods of market disruption
or economic uncertainty, these attempts can be
expected to further increase in volume
• errors made by JPMorganChase or another market
participant, whether inadvertent or malicious,
could cause widespread system disruption
• failure to detect weaknesses or shortcomings
in operational systems in a timely manner
• isolated or seemingly insignificant errors in
operational systems could compound, or migrate
to other systems over time, to become larger
issues
 22 
• disruptions in operational systems or in the
ability of systems to communicate with each
other could be caused by failures in
synchronization or encryption software, or
degraded performance of microprocessors, and
• attempts by third parties to block the use of
key technology solutions by claiming that the
use infringes on their intellectual property
rights.
JPMorganChase also depends on its ability to
access and use the operational systems of third
parties, including its custodians, vendors (such
as those that provide data and cloud computing
services, and security and technology services)
and other market participants (such as clearing
and payment systems, CCPs and securities
exchanges). These external operational systems
with which JPMorgan is connected, whether
directly or indirectly, can be sources of
operational risk to JPMorganChase. JPMorganChase
may be exposed not only to a systems failure or
cyber attack that may be experienced by a vendor
or market infrastructure with which
JPMorganChase is directly connected, but also to
a systems breakdown or cyber attack involving
another party to which such a vendor or
infrastructure is connected. Similarly,
retailers, payment systems and processors, data
aggregators and other external parties with
which JPMorganChase’s customers do business can
increase JPMorganChase’s operational risk. This
is particularly the case where activities of
customers or other parties are beyond
JPMorganChase’s security and control systems,
including through the use of the internet, cloud
computing services, and personal smart phones
and other mobile devices or services.
If an external party obtains access to customer
account data on JPMorganChase’s systems, whether
authorized or unauthorized, and that party
misappropriates that data, this could result in
negative outcomes for JPMorganChase and its
clients and customers, including a heightened
risk of fraudulent transactions using
JPMorganChase’s systems, losses from fraudulent
transactions and reputational harm arising from
the perception that JPMorganChase’s systems may
not be secure.
As JPMorganChase’s interconnectivity with
clients, customers and other external parties
continues to expand, JPMorganChase increasingly
faces the risk of operational failure or cyber
attacks with respect to the systems of those
parties. Security breaches affecting
JPMorganChase’s clients or customers, or systems
breakdowns or failures, security breaches or
human error or misconduct affecting other
external parties, may require JPMorganChase to
take steps to protect the integrity of its own
operational systems or to safeguard confidential
information, including restricting the access of
customers to their accounts. These actions can
increase JPMorganChase’s
operational costs and potentially diminish
customer satisfaction and confidence in
JPMorganChase.
Furthermore, the widespread and expanding
interconnectivity among financial institutions,
clearing banks, CCPs, payments processors,
financial technology companies, securities
exchanges, clearing houses and other financial
market infrastructures increases the risk that
the disruption of an operational system
involving one institution or entity, including
due to a cyber attack, may cause industry-wide
operational disruptions that could materially
affect JPMorganChase’s ability to conduct
business. In addition, the risks associated with
the disruption of an operational system of a
third party could be exacerbated to the extent
that the services provided by that system are
used by a significant number or proportion of
market participants.
The ineffectiveness, failure or other disruption
of operational systems upon which JPMorganChase
depends, including due to a systems malfunction,
cyber incident or other systems failure, could
result in unfavorable ripple effects in the
financial markets and for JPMorganChase and its
clients and customers, including:
• delays or other disruptions in providing
services, including the provision of liquidity
or information to clients and customers
• impairment of JPMorganChase’s ability to
execute transactions, including delays or
failures in the confirmation or settlement of
transactions or in obtaining access to funds or
other assets required for settlement
• the possibility that funds transfers, capital
markets trades or other transactions are
executed erroneously
• financial losses, including due to loss-
sharing requirements of CCPs, payment systems or
other market infrastructures, or as possible
restitution to clients and customers
• higher operational costs associated with
replacing services provided by a system that has
experienced a failure or other disruption
• limitations on JPMorganChase's ability to
collect data needed for its business and
operations
• loss of confidence in the ability of
JPMorganChase, or financial institutions
generally, to protect against and withstand
operational disruptions
• dissatisfaction among JPMorganChase’s clients
or customers
• significant exposure to litigation and
regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions,
and
• harm to JPMorganChase’s reputation.
If JPMorganChase’s operational systems, or those
of acquired businesses or of external parties on
which
 23 
║ Part I ║
JPMorganChase’s businesses depend, are unable to
meet the requirements of JPMorganChase’s
businesses and operations or bank regulatory
standards, or if they fail or have other
significant shortcomings, JPMorganChase could be
materially and adversely affected.
A successful cyber attack affecting
JPMorganChase could cause significant harm to
JPMorganChase and its clients and customers.
JPMorganChase experiences numerous cyber attacks
on its computer systems, software, networks and
other technology assets on a daily basis from
various actors, including groups acting on
behalf of hostile countries, cyber-criminals,
“hacktivists” (i.e., individuals or groups that
use technology to promote a political agenda or
social change) and others. These cyber attacks
can take many forms, including attempts to
introduce computer viruses or malicious code,
which are commonly referred to as “malware,”
into JPMorganChase’s systems. These attacks are
often designed to:
• obtain unauthorized access to JPMorganChase's
systems or to confidential information belonging
to JPMorganChase or its clients, customers,
counterparties or employees
• manipulate data
• destroy data or systems with the aim of
rendering services unavailable
• disrupt, sabotage or degrade service on
JPMorganChase’s systems
• steal money, or
• extort money through the use of so-called
“ransomware.”
JPMorganChase also experiences:
• distributed denial-of-service attacks intended
to disrupt JPMorganChase’s websites, including
those that provide online banking and other
services,
• a higher volume and complexity of cyber
attacks against the backdrop of heightened
geopolitical tensions, and
• a high volume of disruptions to internet-based
services used by JPMorganChase that are provided
by third parties.
JPMorganChase has experienced security breaches
due to cyber attacks in the past, and it is
inevitable that additional breaches will occur
in the future. Any such breach could result in
serious and harmful consequences for
JPMorganChase or its clients and customers.
A principal reason that JPMorganChase cannot
provide absolute security against cyber attacks
is that it may not always be possible to
anticipate, detect or recognize threats to
JPMorganChase’s systems, or to
implement effective preventive measures against
all breaches due to evolving risks, including:
• the techniques used in cyber attacks evolve
frequently and increase in sophistication, and
therefore may not be recognized until launched
or may go undetected for extended periods
• cyber attacks can originate from a wide
variety of sources, including JPMorganChase’s
own employees, cyber-criminals, hacktivists,
groups linked to terrorist organizations or
hostile nation-states that can sustain malicious
activities for extended periods, or third
parties whose objective is to disrupt the
operations of financial institutions more
generally
• JPMorganChase does not have control over the
cybersecurity of the systems of the large number
of clients, customers, counterparties and third-
party service providers with which it does
business, and
• it is possible that a third party, after
establishing a foothold on an internal network
without being detected, may gain access to other
networks and systems.
The risk of a security breach due to a cyber
attack could increase in the future due to
factors such as:
• JPMorganChase’s ongoing expansion of its
digital banking and other internet-based product
offerings and its internal use of internet-based
products and applications, including those that
use cloud computing services
• advances in artificial intelligence, such as
the use of machine learning, generative
artificial intelligence and quantum computing by
malicious actors to develop more advanced social
engineering attacks, including targeted phishing
attacks
• the inability to maintain the security of
information transmitted by JPMorganChase due to
advances in quantum computing that may
counteract or nullify existing information
protections, and
• the acquisition and integration of new
businesses.
In addition, a third party could misappropriate
confidential information obtained by
intercepting signals or communications from
mobile devices used by JPMorganChase’s
employees.
The dynamic nature of the cyber threat
landscape, including the pace of innovation and
increased threat of novel attack methods,
necessitates ongoing investment in, as well as
enhancement and adaptation of, cybersecurity
controls, including the adoption of enhanced
security measures in certain jurisdictions.
Failure to discover or address emerging threats,
known vulnerabilities or shortcomings in
cybersecurity controls, or to prioritize or
complete enhancements to address them, in each
case in a timely manner, may leave JPMorganChase
vulnerable to cyber attacks, potentially
resulting in data breaches, financial losses,
 24 
reputational damage and regulatory penalties,
including the failure to prioritize or complete
enhancements relating to:
• preventing unauthorized access and protecting
against the misuse of access, including the
maintenance and enhancement of controls related
to secure software development practices and
identity and access management, such as those
relating to the management of administrative
access to systems
• detecting, escalating and addressing
effectively and in a timely manner any
vulnerabilities that may be present either in
internally-developed software or externally-
provided software or services, including
vulnerabilities that could allow attackers to
exploit unknown security flaws in software and
hardware (“zero-day vulnerabilities”)
• oversight of third-party vendors and early
detection of attacks against those vendors,
including ransomware attacks and attacks
targeting vulnerabilities in third-party open-
source software, in support of the secure
development and maintenance of internal systems
• maintaining and enhancing controls related to
technology asset management and inventory
systems to prevent the risk of undetected
vulnerabilities that could undermine
JPMorganChase’s ability to operate an effective
control process
• upgrading the coverage and capabilities of
systems and controls to protect JPMorganChase
and its clients and customers from the impact of
distributed denial-of-service attacks, or to
recover from outages that could be caused by a
malware or ransomware attack
• the continuing migration of client-facing
services to the cloud, and modernization of
those services
• strengthening network security and managing
outbound connections to reduce the risk of data
loss
• identifying, assessing and mitigating insider
threat activities that could lead to the misuse
of JPMorganChase’s systems or client and
customer information, and
• integrating acquired businesses where system
integration may be complex or may require
extensive and lengthy remediation or enhancement
of controls.
A successful penetration or circumvention of the
security of JPMorganChase’s systems or the
systems of a vendor, governmental body or
another market participant could cause serious
negative consequences, including:
• significant disruption of JPMorganChase’s
operations and those of its clients, customers
and
counterparties, including losing access to
operational systems
• misappropriation of confidential information
of JPMorganChase or that of its clients,
customers, counterparties, employees or
regulators
• disruption of or damage to JPMorganChase’s
systems and those of its clients, customers and
counterparties
• the inability, or extended delays in the
ability, to fully recover and restore data that
has been stolen, manipulated or destroyed, or
the inability to prevent systems from processing
fraudulent transactions
• demands that JPMorganChase pay a ransom to a
malicious actor that has perpetrated a
cybersecurity breach
• unintended violations by JPMorganChase of
applicable privacy and other laws
• financial loss to JPMorganChase or to its
clients, customers, counterparties or employees
• losses to JPMorganChase in excess of cyber
insurance policy coverage
• loss of confidence in JPMorganChase’s
cybersecurity and business resiliency measures
• dissatisfaction among JPMorganChase’s clients,
customers or counterparties
• significant exposure to litigation and
regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions,
and
• harm to JPMorganChase’s reputation.
The extent of a particular cyber attack, the
methods and tools used by various actors, and
the steps that JPMorganChase may need to take to
investigate the attack may not be immediately
clear, and it may take a significant amount of
time before such an investigation can be
completed. While such an investigation is
ongoing, JPMorganChase may not necessarily know
the full extent of the harm caused by the cyber
attack, and that damage may continue to spread.
These factors may inhibit JPMorganChase’s
ability to provide rapid, full and reliable
information about the cyber attack to its
clients, customers, counterparties and
regulators, as well as the public. Furthermore,
it may not be clear how best to contain and
remediate the harm caused by the cyber attack,
and certain errors or actions could be repeated
or compounded before they are discovered and
remediated. Any or all of these factors could
further increase the costs and consequences of a
cyber attack.
JPMorganChase can be negatively affected if it
fails to identify and address operational risks
associated with the introduction of or changes
to products, services and delivery platforms or
the adoption of new technologies.
When JPMorganChase launches a new product or
service, introduces a new platform for the
delivery or
 25 
║ Part I ║
distribution of products or services (including
mobile connectivity, electronic trading and
cloud computing), acquires or invests in a
business, makes changes to an existing product,
service or delivery platform, or adopts a new
technology, it may not fully appreciate or
identify new operational risks that may arise
from those changes, including increased reliance
on third party providers, or may fail to
implement adequate controls to mitigate the
risks associated with those changes. Any
significant failure in this regard could
diminish JPMorganChase’s ability to operate one
or more of its businesses or result in:
• potential liability to clients, counterparties
and customers
• higher compliance, operational or integration
costs
• higher litigation costs, including regulatory
fines, penalties and other sanctions
• damage to JPMorganChase’s reputation
• impairment of JPMorganChase’s liquidity
• regulatory intervention, or
• weaker competitive standing.
Any of the foregoing consequences could
materially and adversely affect JPMorganChase’s
businesses and results of operations.
JPMorganChase’s business and operations rely on
its ability, and the ability of key external
parties, to maintain appropriately-staffed
workforces, and on the competence,
trustworthiness, health and safety of employees.
JPMorganChase’s ability to operate its
businesses efficiently and profitably, to offer
products and services that meet the expectations
of its clients and customers, and to maintain an
effective risk management framework is highly
dependent on its ability to staff its operations
appropriately and on the competence,
trustworthiness, health and safety of its
employees. JPMorganChase's businesses and
operations similarly rely on the workforces of
third parties, including employees of vendors,
custodians and financial markets
infrastructures, and of businesses that it may
seek to acquire. JPMorganChase’s businesses
could be materially and adversely affected by:
• the ineffective implementation of business
decisions
• any failure to institute controls that
appropriately address risks associated with
business activities, or to appropriately train
employees with respect to those risks and
controls
• staffing shortages, particularly in tight
labor markets
• the possibility that significant portions of
JPMorganChase’s workforce are unable to work
effectively, including because of illness,
quarantines, shelter-in-place arrangements,
government actions or other restrictions in
connection with health
emergencies, the spread of infectious diseases,
epidemics or pandemics, or due to extraordinary
events beyond JPMorganChase’s control such as
natural disasters or an outbreak or escalation
of hostilities
• a significant operational breakdown or
failure, theft, fraud or other unlawful conduct,
or
• other negative outcomes caused by human error
or misconduct by an employee of JPMorganChase or
of another party on which JPMorganChase’s
businesses or operations rely.
JPMorganChase’s operations could also be
impaired if the measures taken by it or by
governmental authorities to protect the health
and safety of its employees are ineffective, or
if any external party on which JPMorganChase
relies fails to take appropriate and effective
actions to protect the health and safety of its
employees.
JPMorganChase faces substantial legal and
operational risks in the processing and
safeguarding of personal information.
JPMorganChase’s businesses and operations are
subject to complex and evolving laws, rules and
regulations, both within and outside the U.S.,
governing the privacy and protection of personal
information of individuals. Governmental
authorities around the world have adopted and
are considering the adoption of numerous
legislative and regulatory initiatives
concerning privacy, data protection and
security. Litigation or enforcement actions
relating to these laws, rules and regulations
could result in fines or orders requiring that
JPMorganChase change its data-related practices,
which could have an adverse effect on
JPMorganChase’s ability to provide products and
otherwise harm its business operations.
Implementing processes relating to
JPMorganChase’s collection, use, sharing and
storage of personal information to comply with
all applicable laws, rules and regulations in
all relevant jurisdictions, including where the
laws of different jurisdictions are in conflict,
can:
• increase JPMorganChase’s compliance and
operating costs
• hinder the development of new products or
services, curtail the offering of existing
products or services, or affect how products and
services are offered to clients and customers
• demand significant oversight by
JPMorganChase’s management, and
• require JPMorganChase to structure its
businesses, operations and systems in less
efficient ways.
Not all of JPMorganChase’s clients, customers,
vendors, counterparties and other external
parties may have appropriate controls in place
to protect the confidentiality, integrity or
availability of the
 26 
information exchanged between them and
JPMorganChase, particularly where information is
transmitted by electronic means. JPMorganChase
could be exposed to litigation or regulatory
fines, penalties or other sanctions if personal
information of clients, customers, employees or
others were to be mishandled or misused, such as
situations where such information is:
• erroneously provided to parties who are not
permitted to have the information, or
• intercepted or otherwise compromised by
unauthorized third parties.
The increasing sophistication of artificial
intelligence technologies poses a greater risk
of identity fraud, as malicious actors may
exploit artificial intelligence to create
convincing false identities or manipulate
verification processes. This challenge
necessitates ongoing enhancements to client
verification systems and security protocols to
prevent unauthorized access and protect
sensitive client information. Failure to manage
these risks or to implement effective
countermeasures could lead to unauthorized
transactions, financial losses, reputational
damage and increased regulatory scrutiny.
Concerns regarding the effectiveness of
JPMorganChase’s measures to safeguard personal
information, or the perception that those
measures are inadequate, could cause
JPMorganChase to lose existing or potential
clients and customers or employees, and thereby
reduce JPMorganChase’s revenues. Furthermore,
any failure or perceived failure by
JPMorganChase to comply with applicable privacy
or data protection laws, rules and regulations,
or any failure to appropriately calibrate,
manage and monitor access by employees or third
parties to personal information, could subject
JPMorganChase to inquiries, examinations and
investigations that could result in requirements
to modify or cease certain operations or
practices, significant liabilities or regulatory
fines, penalties or other sanctions. Any of
these could damage JPMorganChase’s reputation
and otherwise adversely affect its businesses.
In recent years, well-publicized incidents
involving the inappropriate collection, use,
sharing or storage of personal information have
led to expanded governmental scrutiny of
practices relating to the processing or
safeguarding of personal information by
companies in the U.S. and other countries. That
scrutiny has in some cases resulted in, and
could in the future lead to, the adoption of
stricter laws, rules and regulations relating to
the collection, use, sharing and storage of
personal information. These types of laws, rules
and regulations can prohibit or significantly
restrict financial services firms such as
JPMorganChase from transferring information
across national borders or sharing information
among affiliates or with third parties such as
vendors, thereby
increase compliance costs and operational risk,
or restrict JPMorganChase’s use of personal
information when developing or offering products
or services to customers. Some countries are
considering or have adopted legislation
implementing data protection requirements or
requiring local storage and processing of data
which could increase the cost and complexity of
JPMorganChase’s delivery of products and
services. These restrictions could also inhibit
JPMorganChase’s development or marketing of
certain products or services, or increase the
costs of offering them to customers.
JPMorganChase’s operations, results and
reputation could be harmed by occurrences of
extraordinary events beyond its control.
JPMorganChase’s business and operational systems
could be seriously disrupted, and its reputation
could be harmed, by events or contributing
factors that are wholly or partially beyond its
control, including material instances of:
• cyber attacks
• security breaches of its physical premises,
including threats to health and safety
• power, telecommunications or internet outages,
or shutdowns of mass transit
• failure of, or loss of access to, technology
or operational systems, including any resulting
loss of critical data
• interruption of service from third-party
service providers
• damage to or loss of property or assets of
JPMorganChase or third parties, and any
consequent injuries, including in connection
with any construction projects undertaken by
JPMorganChase
• effects of climate change
• natural disasters or severe weather conditions
• accidents such as explosions or structural
failures
• health emergencies, the spread of infectious
diseases, epidemics or pandemics, or
• events arising from local or larger-scale
civil or political unrest, any outbreak or
escalation of hostilities, or terrorist acts.
JPMorganChase operates a Firmwide resiliency
framework that is intended to enable it to
prepare for and adapt to changing conditions and
withstand and recover from, and address any
adverse effects on its operations caused by,
disruptions that may impact critical business
functions and supporting assets, including its
staff, technology, data and facilities and those
of third-party service providers.
Although not every form of disruption can be
anticipated or defended against, JPMorganChase
 27 
║ Part I ║
strives for resiliency or recovery in a range of
scenarios in the event of a disruption,
including due to the occurrence of an
extraordinary event beyond its control. There
can be no assurance that JPMorganChase’s
Firmwide resiliency framework will fully
mitigate all potential resiliency risks to
JPMorganChase, its clients, and customers and
third parties with which it does business, or
that its resiliency framework will be adequate
to address the effects of simultaneous
occurrences of multiple or extended disruption
events. In addition, JPMorganChase’s ability to
respond effectively to a disruption event could
be hampered to the extent that the members of
its workforce, physical assets, systems and
other support infrastructure, or those of its
third-party service providers, that are needed
to address the event are geographically
dispersed, or conversely, if such an event were
to occur in an area in which they are
concentrated. Further, should extraordinary
events or the factors that cause or contribute
to those events become more chronic, the
disruptive effects of those events on
JPMorganChase’s business and operations, and on
its clients, customers, counterparties and
employees, could become more significant and
long-lasting.
Any significant failure or disruption of
JPMorganChase’s operations or operational
systems, or the occurrence of one or more
extraordinary events that are beyond its
control, could:
• hinder JPMorganChase’s ability to provide
services to its clients and customers or to
transact with its counterparties
• require it to expend significant resources to
correct the failure or disruption or to address
the event
• cause it to incur losses or liabilities,
including from loss of revenue, damage to or
loss of property, or injuries
• disrupt market infrastructure systems on which
JPMorganChase’s businesses rely
• expose it to litigation or regulatory fines,
penalties or other sanctions, and
• harm its reputation.
The occurrence of one or more extraordinary
events could also negatively impact the
financial condition or creditworthiness of
JPMorganChase’s clients and customers, and could
lead to an increase in delinquencies, additions
to the allowance for credit losses and higher
net charge-offs, which can reduce
JPMorganChase’s earnings.
Data quality is essential to JPMorganChase’s
business and operations, and if JPMorganChase
fails to maintain adequate data management
processes, this could adversely affect its
ability to effectively manage its businesses,
comply with applicable laws, rules and
regulations, or remain competitive.
JPMorganChase relies on accurate, timely and
complete data to effectively operate its systems
and processes, including:
• assessing risk exposures and limits
• monitoring and detecting fraudulent
transactions and cyber threats
• developing or maintaining models and other
analytical and judgment-based estimations,
including those that use machine learning or
artificial intelligence
• implementing and maintaining compliance
programs, and
• preparing financial statements, disclosures
and regulatory reports, as well as internal
reporting
Any deficiencies in JPMorganChase’s data
management processes, including with respect to
the accuracy or completeness of data, the
timeliness of data collection, the analysis or
validation of data, or the safeguarding of data
could undermine the reliability and
effectiveness of its operations, including:
• risk management practices, including
inaccurate or untimely risk reporting
• delivery of regulatory reporting or internal
or external financial reporting
• compliance practices, such as those relating
to transaction monitoring, customer screening,
blocking and rejecting transactions,
recordkeeping or reporting
• business activities, such as those related to
managing JPMorganChase's market-making positions
and liquidity and capital levels, including
reliance on timely data for informed decision-
making
• providing services to clients and customers,
including transaction processing, lending
services, account management and customer
support, or
• fraud detection and prevention processes.
Any or all of these factors could impair the
ability of JPMorganChase to make sound business
decisions, cause it to incur higher operational
and compliance costs, result in operational
breakdowns or failure to meet its regulatory
requirements, negatively affect clients and
customers, or lead to reputational harm.
Enhanced regulatory and other standards for the
oversight of vendors and other service providers
can result in higher costs and other potential
exposures.
JPMorganChase must comply with enhanced
regulatory and other standards associated with
doing
 28 
business with vendors and other service
providers, including standards relating to the
outsourcing of functions as well as the
performance of significant banking and other
functions by subsidiaries. JPMorganChase incurs
significant costs and expenses in connection
with its initiatives to address the risks
associated with oversight of its internal and
external service providers. JPMorganChase’s
failure to appropriately assess and manage these
relationships, especially those involving
significant banking functions, shared services
or other critical activities, could materially
adversely affect JPMorganChase. Specifically,
any such failure could result in:
• potential harm to clients and customers, and
any liability associated with that harm
• regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions
• lower revenues, and the opportunity cost from
lost revenues
• increased operational costs, or
• harm to JPMorganChase’s reputation.
JPMorganChase’s risk management framework and
control environment will not be effective in
identifying and mitigating every risk to
JPMorganChase.
Any inadequacy or lapse in JPMorganChase’s risk
management framework, governance structure,
practices, models or reporting systems, or in
its control environment, could expose it to
unexpected losses, and its financial condition
or results of operations could be materially and
adversely affected. Any such inadequacy or lapse
could:
• hinder the timely escalation of material risk
issues to JPMorganChase’s senior management and
Board of Directors
• lead to business decisions that have negative
outcomes for JPMorganChase
• require significant resources and time to
remediate
• lead to non-compliance with laws, rules and
regulations
• attract heightened regulatory scrutiny
• expose JPMorganChase to litigation, regulatory
investigations or regulatory fines, penalties or
other sanctions
• lead to potential harm to customers and
clients, and any liability associated with that
harm
• harm its reputation, or
• otherwise diminish confidence in
JPMorganChase.
Many of JPMorganChase’s risk management
strategies and techniques consider historical
market behavior and to some degree are based on
management’s subjective judgment or assumptions.
For example, many models used by JPMorganChase
are based on assumptions regarding historical
correlations among prices of various asset
classes or other market indicators. In times of
market stress, including difficult or less
liquid market environments, or in the event of
other unforeseen circumstances, previously
uncorrelated indicators may become correlated.
Conversely, previously-correlated indicators may
become uncorrelated at those times. Sudden
market movements and unanticipated market or
economic events could, in some circumstances,
limit the effectiveness of JPMorganChase’s risk
management strategies, causing it to incur
losses.
JPMorganChase could recognize unexpected losses,
its capital levels could be reduced and it could
face greater regulatory scrutiny if its models,
estimations or judgments, including those used
in its financial statements, are inadequate or
incorrect.
JPMorganChase has developed and uses a variety
of models and other analytical and judgment-
based estimations to measure, monitor and
implement controls over its market, credit,
capital, liquidity, operational and other risks.
JPMorganChase also uses internal models and
estimations as a basis for its stress testing
and in connection with the preparation of its
financial statements under U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”).
These models and estimations are based on a
variety of assumptions and historical trends,
and are periodically reviewed and modified as
necessary. The models and estimations that
JPMorganChase uses, including those that use
machine learning or artificial intelligence, may
not be effective in all cases to identify,
observe and mitigate risk due to a variety of
factors, such as:
• reliance on historical trends that may not
persist in the future, including assumptions
underlying the models and estimations such as
correlations among certain market indicators or
asset prices
• inherent limitations associated with
forecasting uncertain economic and financial
outcomes
• historical trend information may be
incomplete, or may not be indicative of severely
negative market conditions such as extreme
volatility, dislocation or lack of liquidity
• sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in
prices of certain loans and securities may make
it more difficult to value certain financial
instruments
• technology that is introduced to run models or
estimations may not perform as expected, or may
not be well understood by the personnel using
the technology
• models and estimations may contain erroneous
data, valuations, formulas or algorithms
• review processes may fail to detect flaws in
models and estimations, and
 29 
║ Part I ║
• models may inadvertently incorporate biases
present in data used in the models.
JPMorganChase may experience unexpected losses
if models, estimates or judgments used or
applied in connection with its risk management
activities or the preparation of its financial
statements are inadequate or incorrect. For
example, where quoted market prices are not
available for certain financial instruments that
require a determination of their fair value,
JPMorganChase may make fair value determinations
based on internally developed models or other
means which ultimately rely to some degree on
management estimates and judgment. In addition,
JPMorganChase may experience increased
uncertainty in its estimates if assets acquired
differ from those used to develop those models,
which may lead to unexpected losses.
Similarly, JPMorganChase establishes an
allowance for expected credit losses related to
its credit exposures which requires significant
judgments, including forecasts of how
macroeconomic conditions might impair the
ability of JPMorganChase’s clients and customers
to repay their loans or other obligations. These
types of estimates and judgments may not prove
to be accurate due to a variety of factors,
including when the current and forecasted
environments are significantly different from
the historical environments upon which the
models were developed. The increased uncertainty
may necessitate a greater degree of judgment and
analytics to inform any adjustments that
JPMorganChase may make to model outputs than
would otherwise be the case.
Some of the models and other analytical and
judgment-based estimations used by JPMorganChase
in managing risks are subject to review by, and
require the approval of, JPMorganChase’s
regulators. These reviews are required before
JPMorganChase may use those models and
estimations for calculating market risk RWA,
credit risk RWA and operational risk RWA under
Basel III. If JPMorganChase’s models or
estimations are not approved by its regulators,
it may be subject to higher capital charges,
which could adversely affect its financial
results or limit the ability to expand its
businesses.
Lapses, weaknesses or deficiencies in controls
over disclosure or financial reporting could
materially affect JPMorganChase’s profitability
or reputation.
JPMorganChase’s businesses and operations are
subject to complex and evolving laws, rules and
regulations, both within and outside the U.S.,
requiring continuous enhancements to various
disclosures in its financial statements and
regulatory reports.
There can be no assurance that JPMorganChase’s
disclosure controls and procedures will be
effective in every circumstance, or that a
material weakness or significant deficiency in
internal control over financial reporting will
not occur. Any such lapse, weakness or
deficiency could result in inaccurate financial
reporting which, in turn, could:
• materially and adversely affect
JPMorganChase’s business and results of
operations or financial condition
• restrict its ability to access the capital
markets
• require it to expend significant resources to
correct the lapse, weakness or deficiency
• expose it to litigation or regulatory fines,
penalties or other sanctions
• harm its reputation, or
• otherwise diminish investor confidence in
JPMorganChase.
 Strategic 
JPMorganChase’s results or competitive standing
could suffer if its management fails to develop
and execute effective business strategies, and
to anticipate changes affecting those
strategies.
The development and execution of effective
business strategies by JPMorganChase’s
management, along with the ability to anticipate
and respond to shifts in the competitive
environment, are critical to JPMorganChase's
competitive standing and to achieving its
strategic objectives. These strategies relate
to:
• the products and services that JPMorganChase
offers
• the geographies in which it operates
• the types of clients and customers that it
serves
• the businesses that it acquires or in which it
invests
• the counterparties with which it does business
• the technologies that it adopts or in which it
invests, which may include new and currently
unproven technologies, and
• the methods, distribution channels and third
party service providers by or through which it
offers products and services.
If management makes choices about these
strategies and goals that prove to be incorrect,
are based on incomplete, inaccurate or
fraudulent information, do not accurately assess
the competitive landscape and industry trends,
or fail to address changing regulatory and
market environments or the expectations of
clients, customers, investors, employees and
other stakeholders, then the franchise values
and growth prospects of JPMorganChase’s
businesses may suffer and its earnings could
decline.
JPMorganChase’s growth prospects also depend on
management’s ability to develop and execute
effective business plans to address these
strategic priorities, both in the near term and
over longer time horizons. Management’s
effectiveness in this regard will affect
 30 
JPMorganChase’s ability to develop and enhance
its resources, control expenses and return
capital to shareholders. Each of these
objectives could be adversely affected by any
failure on the part of management to:
• devise effective business plans and strategies
• offer products and services that meet changing
expectations of clients and customers
• allocate capital in a manner that promotes
long-term stability to enable JPMorganChase to
build and invest in market-leading businesses,
even in a highly stressed environment
• allocate capital appropriately due to
imprecise modeling or subjective judgments made
in connection with those allocations
• appropriately assess and monitor principal
investments made to enhance or accelerate
JPMorganChase's business strategies
• conduct appropriate due diligence on
prospective business acquisitions or
investments, or effectively integrate newly-
acquired businesses
• appropriately address concerns of clients,
customers, investors, employees and other
stakeholders, including with respect to climate
and other ESG matters
• react quickly to changes in market conditions
or market structures, or
• develop and enhance the operational,
technology, risk, financial and managerial
resources and capabilities necessary to grow and
manage JPMorganChase’s businesses.
Furthermore, JPMorganChase may incur costs in
connection with disposing of excess properties,
premises and facilities, and those costs could
be material to its results of operations.
JPMorganChase faces significant and increasing
competition in the rapidly evolving financial
services industry.
JPMorganChase operates in a highly competitive
environment in which it must evolve and adapt to
changes in financial regulation, technological
advances, increased public scrutiny and changes
in economic conditions. JPMorganChase expects
that competition in the U.S. and global
financial services industry will continue to be
intense. Competitors include:
• other banks and financial institutions
• trading, advisory and investment management
firms
• finance companies
• technology companies, and
• other non-bank firms that are engaged in
providing similar as well as new products and
services.
JPMorganChase cannot provide assurance that the
significant competition in the financial
services industry will not materially and
adversely affect its future results of
operations. For example, aggressive or less
disciplined lending practices by non-bank
competitors could lead to a loss of market share
for traditional banks, and in an economic
downturn could result in instability in the
financial services industry and adversely impact
other market participants, including
JPMorganChase.
New competitors in the financial services
industry continue to emerge. For example,
technological advances and the growth of
e-commerce have made it possible for non-
depository institutions to offer products and
services that traditionally were banking
products. These advances have also allowed
financial institutions and other companies to
provide electronic and internet-based financial
solutions, including electronic securities and
cryptocurrency trading, lending and other
extensions of credit to consumers, payments
processing and online automated algorithmic-
based investment advice. Furthermore, both
financial institutions and their non-banking
competitors face the risk that payments
processing and other products and services,
including deposits and other traditional banking
products, could be significantly disrupted by
the use of new technologies, such as
cryptocurrencies and other applications using
secure distributed ledgers, that may not require
intermediation. New technologies have required
and could require JPMorganChase to spend more to
modify or adapt its products to attract and
retain clients and customers or to match
products and services offered by its
competitors, including technology companies. In
addition, new technologies may be used by
customers, or breached or infiltrated by third
parties, in unexpected ways, which can increase
JPMorganChase’s costs for complying with laws,
rules and regulations that apply to the offering
of products and services through those
technologies and reduce the income that
JPMorganChase earns from providing products and
services through those technologies.
Ongoing or increased competition may put
pressure on the pricing for JPMorganChase’s
products and services or may cause JPMorganChase
to lose market share, particularly with respect
to traditional banking products. This
competition may be based on quality and variety
of products and services offered, transaction
execution, innovation, reputation and price. The
failure of any of JPMorganChase’s businesses to
meet the expectations of clients and customers,
whether due to general market conditions, under-
performance, a decision not to offer a
particular product or service, changes in client
and customer expectations or other factors,
could affect JPMorganChase’s ability to attract
or retain clients and customers. Any such impact
could, in turn, reduce
 31 
║ Part I ║
JPMorganChase’s revenues. Increased competition
also may require JPMorganChase to make
additional capital investments in its
businesses, or to extend more of its capital on
behalf of its clients to remain competitive.
The effects of climate change could adversely
affect JPMorganChase’s business and operations,
both directly and as a result of impacts on its
clients and customers.
JPMorganChase operates in many regions,
countries and communities around the world where
its business, and the activities of its clients
and customers, could be adversely affected by
climate change. Climate change could manifest as
a financial risk to JPMorganChase either through
changes in the physical climate or from the
process of transitioning to a lower-carbon
economy. Both physical risks and transition
risks associated with climate change could have
negative impacts on the financial condition or
creditworthiness of JPMorganChase’s clients and
customers, on JPMorganChase's exposure to
affected companies and markets, and on the
effectiveness of JPMorganChase’s existing
business strategy with respect to its
operations, clients and customers.
Physical risks include the increased frequency
or severity of acute weather events, such as
floods, wildfires and tropical cyclones, and
chronic shifts in the climate, such as rising
sea levels, persistent changes in precipitation
levels, or increases in average ambient
temperatures. Potential adverse impacts of
climate-related physical risks to JPMorganChase,
its clients or customers include:
• declines in asset values, including due to the
destruction or degradation of property
• reduced availability or increased cost of
insurance for clients of JPMorganChase
• interruptions to business operations,
including supply chain disruption, and
• population migration or unemployment in
affected regions.
Transition risks arise from the financial and
economic consequences of society’s shift towards
a lower-carbon economy, such as changes in
public policy, adoption of new technologies or
changes in consumer preferences towards low-
carbon goods and services. These risks could
also be influenced by changes in the physical
climate. Potential adverse impacts of transition
risks to JPMorganChase, its clients or customers
include:
• sudden devaluation of assets, including
unanticipated write-downs (“stranded assets”)
• increased operational and compliance costs
driven by changes in climate policy
• increased energy costs driven by governmental
actions and initiatives such as emission pricing
and accelerated decarbonization policies
• negative consequences to business models, and
the need to make changes in response to those
consequences, and
• damage to JPMorganChase’s reputation,
including due to any perception that its
business practices are contrary to public policy
or the preferences of different stakeholders.
Climate risks can also arise from
inconsistencies and conflicts in the manner in
which climate policy and financial regulations
are implemented in the many regions where
JPMorganChase operates, including initiatives to
apply and enforce policy and regulation with
extraterritorial effect. Additionally, internal
models and estimations used in climate risk
assessments have an increased level of
uncertainty due to limited historical trend
information and the absence of standardized,
reliable and comprehensive greenhouse gas
emissions data, which could lead to inaccurate
disclosures or financial reporting.
 Conduct 
Conduct failure by JPMorganChase employees can
harm clients and customers, impact market
integrity, damage JPMorganChase’s reputation and
trigger litigation and regulatory action.
JPMorganChase’s employees interact with clients,
customers, counterparties and other market and
industry participants, and with each other,
every day. All employees are expected to
demonstrate values and exhibit the behaviors
that are an integral part of JPMorganChase’s
Code of Conduct and Business Principles.
JPMorganChase endeavors to embed conduct risk
management throughout an employee’s life cycle,
including recruiting, onboarding, training and
development, and performance management. Conduct
risk management is also an integral component of
JPMorganChase’s promotion and compensation
processes.
Notwithstanding these expectations, policies and
practices, certain employees have engaged in
improper or illegal conduct in the past. These
instances of misconduct have resulted in
litigation, and resolutions of governmental
investigations or enforcement actions involving
consent orders, deferred prosecution agreements,
non-prosecution agreements and other civil or
criminal sanctions. There is no assurance that
further inappropriate or unlawful actions by
employees have not occurred or will not occur,
lead to a violation of the terms of these
resolutions (and associated consequences), or
that any such actions will always be detected,
deterred or prevented.
JPMorganChase’s reputation could be harmed by,
and collateral consequences could result from, a
failure by
 32 
one or more employees to conduct themselves in
accordance with JPMorganChase’s expectations,
policies and practices, including by acting in
ways that harm clients, customers, other market
participants, employees or others. Some examples
of this include:
• improperly selling and marketing
JPMorganChase’s products or services
• engaging in insider trading, market
manipulation or unauthorized trading
• engaging in improper or fraudulent behavior in
connection with government relief programs
• facilitating a transaction where a material
objective is to achieve a particular tax,
accounting or financial disclosure treatment
that may be subject to scrutiny by governmental
or regulatory authorities, or where the proposed
treatment is unclear or may not reflect the
economic substance of the transaction
• failing to fulfill fiduciary obligations or
other duties owed to clients or customers
• violating antitrust or anti-competition laws
by colluding with other market participants
• using electronic communications channels that
have not been approved by JPMorganChase
• engaging in discriminatory behavior or
harassment with respect to clients, customers or
employees, or acting contrary to JPMorganChase’s
goal of fostering an inclusive workplace
• managing or reporting risks in ways that
subordinate JPMorganChase’s risk appetite to
business performance goals or employee
compensation objectives, and
• misappropriating property, confidential or
proprietary information, or technology assets
belonging to JPMorganChase, its clients and
customers or third parties.
The consequences of any failure by one or more
employees to conduct themselves in accordance
with JPMorganChase’s expectations, policies or
practices could include litigation, or
regulatory or other governmental investigations
or enforcement actions. Any of these proceedings
or actions could result in judgments,
settlements, fines, penalties or other
sanctions, or lead to:
• financial losses
• increased operational and compliance costs
• greater scrutiny by regulators and other
parties
• regulatory actions that require JPMorganChase
to restructure, curtail or cease certain of its
activities
• the need for significant oversight by
JPMorganChase’s management
• loss of clients or customers, and
• harm to JPMorganChase’s reputation.
The foregoing risks could be heightened with
respect to newly-acquired businesses if
JPMorganChase fails to successfully integrate
employees of those businesses or any of those
employees do not conduct themselves in
accordance with JPMorganChase's expectations,
policies and practices.
 Reputation 
Damage to JPMorganChase’s reputation could harm
its businesses.
Maintaining trust in JPMorganChase is critical
to its ability to attract and retain clients,
customers, investors and employees. Damage to
JPMorganChase’s reputation can therefore cause
significant harm to JPMorganChase’s business and
prospects, and can arise from numerous sources,
including:
• employee misconduct, including discriminatory
behavior or harassment with respect to clients,
customers or employees, or actions that are
contrary to JPMorganChase’s goal of fostering an
inclusive workplace
• security breaches, including as a result of
cyber attacks
• failure to safeguard client, customer or
employee information
• failure to manage risks associated with its
client relationships, or with transactions or
business activities in which JPMorganChase or
its clients engage, including transactions or
activities that may be unpopular among one or
more constituencies
• rapid and broad dissemination of
misinformation and disinformation across the
media landscape, including social networking
sites
• incorrect, biased or misleading results or
content generated by artificial intelligence,
leading to harmful outcomes, including
discrimination in lending practices against
vulnerable populations, fraud, manipulation of
customers, privacy breaches or intellectual
property infringement
• deficiencies or perceived failures in managing
ESG-related initiatives, including modifying or
failing to meet publicly-announced targets
• operational failures
• litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or
other sanctions
• actions taken in executing regulatory and
governmental requirements during a global or
regional health emergency, spread of infectious
disease, epidemic or pandemic
• regulatory investigations or enforcement
actions, or resolutions of these matters, and
• failure or perceived failure to comply with
laws, rules or regulations by JPMorganChase or
its clients,
 33 
║ Part I ║
customers, counterparties or other parties,
including newly-acquired businesses, companies
in which JPMorganChase has made principal
investments, parties to joint ventures with
JPMorganChase, and vendors with which
JPMorganChase does business.
Social and environmental activists have been
targeting JPMorganChase and other financial
services firms with public criticism concerning
their business practices, including business
relationships with clients that are engaged in
certain sensitive industries, such as companies:
• whose products are or are perceived to be
harmful to human health, or
• whose activities negatively affect or are
perceived to negatively affect the environment,
workers’ rights or communities.
Activists have also taken actions intended to
change or influence JPMorganChase’s business
practices with respect to ESG matters, including
public protests at JPMorganChase’s headquarters
and other properties, and submitting specific
ESG-related proposals for a vote by
JPMorganChase’s shareholders.
In addition, JPMorganChase has been and expects
that it will continue to be criticized by
activists, politicians and other members of the
public concerning business practices or
positions taken by JPMorganChase with respect to
matters of public policy (such as diversity,
equity and inclusion initiatives) or regarding
transactions or other business or interactions
between JPMorganChase and governmental or
regulatory bodies. Furthermore, JPMorganChase's
relationships or ability to transact with
clients and customers, and with governmental or
regulatory bodies in jurisdictions in which
JPMorganChase does business, could be adversely
affected if its decisions with respect to doing
business with companies in certain sensitive
industries are perceived to harm those companies
or to align with particular political
viewpoints. The foregoing types of criticism can
be more widespread during election years in
various jurisdictions, and could have the effect
of focusing attention on a company such as
JPMorganChase as part of a wider public debate
on public policy matters. Furthermore,
JPMorganChase's participation in or association
with certain environmental and social industry
groups or initiatives could be viewed by
activists or governmental authorities as
boycotting or other discriminatory business
behavior.
These and other types of criticism and actions
directed at JPMorganChase could potentially
engender dissatisfaction among clients,
customers, investors, employees, government
officials and other stakeholders. In all of
these cases, JPMorganChase’s reputation and its
business and results of operations could be
harmed by:
• greater scrutiny from governmental or
regulatory bodies, or further criticism from
politicians and other members of the public,
including in the form of governmental or
regulatory investigations or litigation
• unfavorable coverage or commentary in the
media, including through social media campaigns
• certain clients and customers ceasing doing
business with JPMorganChase, and encouraging
others to do so
• impairment of JPMorganChase’s ability to
attract new clients and customers, to expand its
relationships with existing clients and
customers, or to hire or retain employees, or
• certain investors opting to divest from
investments in securities of JPMorganChase.
Actions by the financial services industry
generally or individuals in the industry can
also affect JPMorganChase’s reputation. For
example, the reputation of the industry as a
whole can be damaged by concerns that:
• consumers have been treated unfairly by a
financial institution, or
• a financial institution has acted
inappropriately with respect to the methods used
to offer products to customers.
If JPMorganChase is perceived to have engaged in
these types of behaviors, this could weaken its
reputation among clients or customers, employees
or other stakeholders.
Failure to effectively manage potential
conflicts of interest or to satisfy fiduciary
obligations can result in litigation and
enforcement actions, as well as damage
JPMorganChase’s reputation.
JPMorganChase’s ability to manage potential
conflicts of interest is highly complex due to
the broad range of its business activities which
encompass a variety of transactions, obligations
and interests with and among JPMorganChase’s
clients and customers. JPMorganChase can become
subject to litigation, enforcement actions, and
heightened regulatory scrutiny, and its
reputation can be damaged, by the failure or
perceived failure to:
• adequately address or appropriately disclose
conflicts of interest, including potential
conflicts of interest that may arise in
connection with providing multiple products and
services in, or having one or more investments
related to, the same transaction
• identify and address any conflict of interest
that a third party with which it is does
business may have with respect to a transaction
involving JPMorganChase
• deliver appropriate standards of service and
quality
 34 
• treat clients and customers fairly and with
the appropriate standard of care
• use client and customer data responsibly and
in a manner that meets legal requirements and
regulatory expectations
• provide fiduciary products or services in
accordance with the applicable legal and
regulatory standards, or
• handle or use confidential information of
customers or clients appropriately and in
compliance with applicable data protection and
privacy laws, rules and regulations.
A failure or perceived failure to appropriately
address conflicts of interest or fiduciary
obligations could result in customer
dissatisfaction, litigation and regulatory
fines, penalties or other sanctions, and
heightened regulatory scrutiny and enforcement
actions, all of which can lead to lost revenue
and higher operating costs and cause serious
harm to JPMorganChase’s reputation.
 Country 
An outbreak or escalation of hostilities between
countries or within a country or region could
have a material adverse effect on the global
economy and on JPMorganChase’s businesses within
the affected region or globally.
Aggressive actions by hostile governments or
groups, including armed conflict or intensified
cyber attacks, could expand in unpredictable
ways by drawing in other countries or escalating
into full-scale war with potentially
catastrophic consequences, particularly if one
or more of the combatants possess nuclear
weapons. Depending on the scope of the conflict,
the hostilities could result in:
• worldwide economic disruption
• heightened volatility in financial markets
• severe declines in asset values, accompanied
by widespread sell-offs of investments
• sudden increases in prices in the energy and
commodity markets or for certain safe haven
currencies
• substantial depreciation of local currencies,
potentially leading to defaults by borrowers and
counterparties in the affected region
• disruption of global trade
• diminished consumer, business and investor
confidence
• refugee and humanitarian crises, and
• new economic sanctions or other regulatory
requirements, including those that introduce
exceptional compliance challenges for
multinational companies such as JPMorganChase.
Any of the above consequences could have
significant negative effects on JPMorganChase’s
operations and earnings, both in the countries
or regions directly affected by the hostilities
or globally. Further, if the U.S. were to become
directly involved in such a conflict, this could
lead to a curtailment of any operations that
JPMorganChase may have in the affected countries
or region, as well as in any nation that is
aligned against the U.S. in the hostilities.
JPMorganChase could also experience more
numerous and aggressive cyber attacks launched
by or under the sponsorship of one or more of
the adversaries in such a conflict.
JPMorganChase’s business and operations in
certain countries can be adversely affected by
local economic, political, regulatory and social
factors.
Some of the countries in which JPMorganChase
conducts business have economies or markets that
are less developed and more volatile or may have
political, legal and regulatory regimes that are
less established or predictable than other
countries in which JPMorganChase operates. In
addition, in some jurisdictions in which
JPMorganChase conducts business, the local
economy and business activities are subject to
substantial government influence or control.
Some of these countries have in the past
experienced economic disruptions, including:
• extreme currency fluctuations
• high inflation
• low or negative growth
• defaults or reduced ability to service
sovereign debt and
• increased fraud or other misrepresentation of
value.
The governments in these countries have
sometimes reacted to these developments by
imposing restrictive policies that adversely
affect the local and regional business
environment, such as:
• price, capital or exchange controls, including
imposition of punitive transfer and
convertibility restrictions or forced currency
exchange
• expropriation or nationalization of assets,
including client assets, or confiscation of
property, including intellectual property, and
• changes in laws, rules and regulations.
The impact of these actions could be accentuated
in trading markets that are smaller, less liquid
and more volatile than more-developed markets.
These types of government actions can negatively
affect JPMorganChase’s operations in the
relevant country, either directly or by
suppressing the business activities of local
clients or multi-national clients that conduct
business in the jurisdiction.
In addition, emerging markets countries, as well
as more developed countries, have been
susceptible to
 35 
║ Part I ║
unfavorable social developments arising from
poor economic conditions or governmental
actions, including:
• widespread demonstrations, civil unrest or
general strikes
• crime and corruption
• security and personal safety issues
• an outbreak or escalation of hostilities, or
other geopolitical instabilities
• overthrow of incumbent governments
• terrorist attacks, and
• other forms of internal discord.
These economic, political, regulatory and social
developments have in the past resulted in, and
in the future could lead to, conditions that can
adversely affect JPMorganChase’s operations in
those countries and impair the revenues, growth
and profitability of those operations. In
addition, any of these events or circumstances
in one country can affect JPMorganChase’s
operations and investments in another country or
countries, including in the U.S.
 People 
JPMorganChase’s ability to attract and retain
qualified employees is critical to its success.
JPMorganChase’s employees are its most important
resource, and in many areas of the financial
services industry, competition for qualified
personnel is intense. JPMorganChase endeavors to
attract talented new employees from a variety of
backgrounds and retain, develop and motivate its
existing employees. JPMorganChase's efforts to
hire and retain talented employees could be
hindered by factors such as:
• the emerging need for more-skilled workers in
an evolving labor and workplace environment,
including due to changes in technology
• targeted recruitment of JPMorganChase
employees by competitors, and
• modifications to or discontinuation of
JPMorganChase's hybrid work models.
JPMorganChase's performance and competitive
position could be materially and adversely
affected if it is unable to attract or retain
qualified employees for its workforce or to
devise and execute effective succession planning
for key leadership roles, such as the Chief
Executive Officer, members of the Operating
Committee and other senior leaders.
In addition, advances in technology, such as
automation and artificial intelligence, may lead
to workforce displacement. This could require
JPMorganChase to invest in additional employee
training, manage impacts on morale and
retention, and compete for employment candidates
who possess more advanced technological skills,
all of which could
have a negative impact on JPMorganChase's
business and operations.
Unfavorable changes in immigration or travel
policies could adversely affect JPMorganChase’s
businesses and operations.
JPMorganChase relies on the skills, knowledge
and expertise of employees located throughout
the world. Changes in immigration or travel
policies in the U.S. and other countries that
unduly restrict or otherwise make it more
difficult for employees or their family members
to work in, or travel to or transfer between,
jurisdictions in which JPMorganChase has
operations or conducts its business could
inhibit JPMorganChase’s ability to attract and
retain qualified employees, and thereby dilute
the quality of its workforce, or could prompt
JPMorganChase to make structural changes to its
worldwide or regional operating models that
cause its operations to be less efficient or
more costly.
 Legal 
JPMorganChase faces significant legal risks from
litigation and formal and informal regulatory
and government investigations.
JPMorganChase is named as a defendant or is
otherwise involved in many legal proceedings,
including class actions, derivative actions and
other litigation or disputes with third parties,
as well as criminal proceedings. Actions
currently pending against JPMorganChase may
result in judgments, settlements, fines,
penalties or other sanctions adverse to
JPMorganChase. Any of these matters could
materially and adversely affect JPMorganChase’s
business, financial condition or results of
operations, or cause serious reputational harm.
As a participant in the financial services
industry, it is likely that JPMorganChase will
continue to experience a high level of
litigation and regulatory and government
investigations related to its businesses and
operations.
Regulators and other government agencies conduct
examinations of JPMorganChase and its
subsidiaries both on a routine basis and in
targeted exams, and JPMorganChase’s businesses
and operations are subject to heightened
regulatory oversight. This heightened regulatory
scrutiny, or the results of such an
investigation or examination, may lead to
additional regulatory investigations or
enforcement actions. There is no assurance that
those actions will not result in resolutions or
other enforcement actions against JPMorganChase.
Furthermore, a single event involving a
potential violation of law or regulation may
give rise to numerous and overlapping
investigations and proceedings, either by
multiple federal, state or local agencies and
officials in the U.S. or, in some instances,
regulators and other governmental officials in
non-U.S. jurisdictions.
 36 
In addition, if another financial institution
violates a law or regulation relating to a
particular business activity or practice, this
will often give rise to an investigation by
regulators and other governmental agencies of
the same or similar activity or practice by
JPMorganChase.
JPMorganChase could become subject to a
significant regulatory investigation and be
unable to disclose specific information
concerning that investigation to the public if
such a disclosure would violate JPMorganChase’s
obligations under applicable rules and
regulations to maintain the confidentiality of
confidential supervisory information, even if
the resolution of that investigation could have
a material adverse effect on JPMorganChase’s
business, operations, results or financial
condition.
Regulatory investigations, examinations or other
initiatives by U.S. and non-U.S. governmental
authorities may subject JPMorganChase to
judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or
other sanctions, and may require JPMorganChase
to restructure its operations and activities or
to cease offering certain products or services.
All of these potential outcomes could harm
JPMorganChase’s reputation or lead to higher
operational costs, thereby reducing
JPMorganChase’s profitability, or result in
collateral consequences. In addition, the extent
of JPMorganChase’s exposure to legal and
regulatory matters can be unpredictable and
could, in some cases, exceed the amount of
reserves that JPMorganChase has established for
those matters.

The internal control framework promulgated by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (“COSO”), “Internal Control
— Integrated Framework” (“COSO 2013”), provides
guidance for designing, implementing and
conducting internal control and assessing its
effectiveness. The Firm used the COSO 2013
framework to assess the effectiveness of the
Firm’s internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2024. Refer to “Management’s
report on internal control over financial
reporting” on page 168.
As of the end of the period covered by this
report, an evaluation was carried out under the
supervision and with the participation of the
Firm’s management, including its Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial
Officer, of the effectiveness of its disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rule
13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934). Based on that evaluation, the Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief
Financial Officer concluded that these
disclosure controls and procedures were
effective. Refer to Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 for
the Certifications furnished by the Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, respectively.
The Firm is committed to maintaining high
standards of internal control over financial
reporting. Nevertheless, because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect all
misstatements. Deficiencies or lapses in
internal controls may occur from time to time,
and there can be no assurance that any such
deficiencies will not result in significant
deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal
control in the future and collateral
consequences therefrom. Refer to “Management’s
report on internal control over financial
reporting” on page 168 for further information.
There was no change in the Firm’s internal
control over financial reporting (as defined in
Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934) that occurred during the three months
ended December 31, 2024, that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, the Firm’s internal control over
financial reporting.

Visa shares: On April 8, 2024, Visa Inc. commenced an initial exchange offer for its Class B-1 common
shares. On May 6, 2024, the Firm announced that Visa had accepted the Firm’s tender of its 37.2
million Visa Class B-1 common shares in exchange for a combination of Visa Class B-2 common shares
and Visa Class C common shares (“Visa C shares”), resulting in a $7.9 billion net gain related to
Visa shares recorded in the second quarter of 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Firm had disposed
of all of its Visa C shares through sales and through a contribution to the Firm’s Foundation. Refer
to Market Risk Management on pages 141–149, and Notes 2 and 6 for additional information. First
Republic: JPMorganChase acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of First Republic
Bank from the FDIC on May 1, 2023. As a result, the year-to-date results include the twelve-month
impact of First Republic compared with eight months in the prior-year period. Where meaningful to the
results, this is referred to in this Form 10-K as the "timing impact" of First Republic. Refer to
Notes 6 and 34 for additional information. Comparisons noted in the sections below are for the full
year of 2024 versus the full year of 2023, unless otherwise specified. Firmwide overview
JPMorganChase reported net income of $58.5 billion for 2024, up 18%, earnings per share of $19.75,
ROE of 18% and ROTCE of 22%. • Total net revenue was $177.6 billion, up 12%, reflecting: – Net
interest income (“NII”) of $92.6 billion, up 4%, driven by the impact of balance sheet actions,
primarily reinvestments in the investment securities portfolio, higher revolving balances in Card
Services, the timing impact of First Republic, higher wholesale deposit balances, and higher Markets
net interest income, largely offset by deposit margin compression across the lines of business and
lower average deposit balances in CCB. NII excluding Markets was $92.4 billion, up 3%. – Noninterest
revenue (“NIR”) was $85.0 billion, up 23%, predominantly driven by a $7.9 billion net gain related to
Visa shares recorded in the second quarter of 2024, higher asset management fees in AWM and CCB,
higher investment banking fees, and lower net investment securities losses in Treasury and CIO. The
prior year included the estimated bargain purchase gain of $2.8 billion associated with First
Republic.
 54 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K 
• Noninterest expense was $91.8 billion, up 5%,
driven by higher compensation expense, including
higher revenue-related compensation and growth
in the number of employees, as well as a $1.0
billion contribution of Visa shares to the
JPMorgan Chase Foundation recorded in the second
quarter of 2024, partially offset by lower FDIC-
related expense, reflecting a $2.9 billion
special assessment recognized in the fourth
quarter of 2023, compared with a $725 million
increase to the FDIC special assessment
recognized in the first quarter of 2024.
• The provision for credit losses was $10.7
billion, reflecting $8.6 billion of net charge-
offs and a net addition to the allowance for
credit losses of $2.0 billion. Net charge-offs
increased by $2.4 billion, driven by Card
Services, reflecting the seasoning of vintages
originated in recent years, credit
normalization, and balance growth. The net
addition to the allowance for credit losses
included a net addition of $2.1 billion in
consumer , driven by Card Services, and a net
reduction of $19 million in wholesale .
The provision in the prior year was $9.3
billion, reflecting $6.2 billion of net charge-
offs and a $3.1 billion net addition to the
allowance for credit losses.
• The total allowance for credit losses was
$26.9 billion at December 31, 2024. The Firm had
an allowance for loan losses to retained loans
coverage ratio of 1.87%, compared with 1.75% in
the prior year.
• The Firm’s nonperforming assets totaled $9.3
billion at December 31, 2024, up 22%, driven by
higher wholesale nonaccrual loans, which
reflected downgrades in Real Estate,
concentrated in Office, partially offset by
lower consumer nonaccrual loans, which included
loan sales. Refer to Wholesale Credit Portfolio
and Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 126–136
and pages 120–125, respectively, for additional
information.
• Firmwide average loans of $1.3 trillion were
up 6%, driven by higher loans across the lines
of business.
• Firmwide average deposits of $2.4 trillion
were up 1%, reflecting:
– net inflows in Payments and net issuances of
structured notes in Markets,
– the timing impact of First Republic, and
– growth in balances in new and existing client
accounts in AWM,
predominantly offset by
– a decline in CCB primarily driven by a
decrease in balances in existing accounts due to
increased customer spending.
Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages
108–115 for additional information.
 Selected capital and other metrics 
• CET1 capital was $275.5 billion, and the
Standardized and Advanced CET1 ratios were 15.7%
and 15.8%, respectively.
• SLR was 6.1%.
• TBVPS grew 13.0%, ending 2024 at $97.30.
• As of December 31, 2024, the Firm had eligible
end-of-period High Quality Liquid Assets
(“HQLA”) of approximately $834 billion and
unencumbered marketable securities with a fair
value of approximately $594 billion, resulting
in approximately $1.4 trillion of liquidity
sources. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on
pages 108–115 for additional information.

(a) Included operating lease income of $2.8 billion, $2.8 billion and $3.7 billion for the years
ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Refer to Note 6 for additional information. (b)
Effective January 1, 2024, as a result of adopting updates to the Accounting for Investments in Tax
Credit Structures guidance, the amortization of certain of the Firm’s alternative energy tax-oriented
investments that was previously recognized in other income is now recognized in income tax expense.
Refer to Notes 1, 6, 14 and 25 for additional information. (c) Included the net gain related to Visa
shares of $7.9 billion recorded in the second quarter of 2024. Refer to Notes 2 and 6 for additional
information. (d) Included the estimated bargain purchase gain of $2.8 billion for the year ended
December 31, 2023 associated with the First Republic acquisition. Refer to Notes 6 and 34 for
additional information. 2024 compared with 2023 Investment banking fees increased, reflecting in CIB
the benefit of favorable market conditions, which resulted in: • higher debt underwriting fees
predominantly driven by higher industry-wide issuances in leveraged loans, and in high-grade and
high-yield bonds, • higher equity underwriting fees driven by higher industry-wide fees and wallet
share gains in IPOs, and in follow-on and convertible securities offerings, and • higher advisory
fees driven by higher industry-wide mergers and acquisitions (“M&A”) activity and wallet share gains.
Refer to CIB segment results on pages 77–83 and Note 6 for additional information. Principal
transactions revenue increased driven by CIB, reflecting: • higher Equity Markets revenue in Prime
Finance and Equity Derivatives, predominantly offset by • lower Fixed Income Markets revenue,
reflecting the net impact of declines in revenue across macro businesses and higher revenue in
Securitized Products. Principal transactions revenue in CIB generally has offsets across other
revenue lines, including net interest income. The Firm assesses the performance of its Markets
business on a total net revenue basis. The increase in CIB was partially offset by a net decrease in
Corporate, reflecting lower revenue in Treasury and CIO, and gains compared with a net loss on
certain legacy private equity investments in the prior year. Refer to CIB segment and Corporate
results on pages 77–83 and pages 88–90, respectively, and Note 6 for additional information. Lending-
and deposit-related fees increased, reflecting, in CIB, higher deposit-related fees, including cash
management fees in Payments, on higher volume; and higher lending-related fees, including loan
commitment fees. These factors were largely offset by a decline in the amortization of the fair value
discount on certain acquired lending-related commitments associated with First Republic, primarily in
AWM, as certain of the commitments have expired. Refer to CIB and AWM segment results on pages 77–83
and pages 84–87, respectively, and Note 6 for additional information. Asset management fees
increased, reflecting, in AWM and CCB, higher average market levels and net inflows, as well as
higher performance fees in AWM; and in CCB, the timing impact of First Republic. Refer to CCB and AWM
segment results on pages 73–76 and pages 84–87, respectively, and Note 6 for additional information.
 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K 59 
Commissions and other fees increased,
predominantly due to higher brokerage
commissions and fees on higher volume, and
higher custody fees, in both CIB and AWM, as
well as higher annuity sales commissions in CCB.
Refer to CCB, CIB and AWM segment results on
pages 73–76, pages 77–83 and pages 84–87,
respectively, and Note 6 for additional
information.
Investment securities losses decreased,
reflecting lower losses on sales of securities,
primarily U.S. Treasuries and U.S. GSE and
government agency MBS, associated with
repositioning the investment securities
portfolio in Treasury and CIO. Refer to
Corporate results on pages 88–90 and Note 10 for
additional information.
Mortgage fees and related income increased in
Home Lending, reflecting higher production
revenue, which included the timing impact of
First Republic. Refer to CCB segment results on
pages 73–76, and Note 6 and 15 for additional
information.
Card income increased, reflecting higher net
interchange on increased debit and credit card
sales volume, as well as higher annual fees in
CCB, partially offset by an increase in
amortization related to new account origination
costs. Refer to CCB segment results on pages
73–76 and Note 6 for additional information.
Other income increased, reflecting:
• in Corporate:
– the $7.9 billion net gain related to Visa
shares recorded in the second quarter of 2024,
partially offset by
– the absence of the prior-year $2.8 billion
estimated bargain purchase gain associated with
the First Republic acquisition, and
• in CIB:
– the impact of the adoption of updates to the
Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit
Structures guidance effective January 1, 2024,
resulting in the amortization of certain of the
Firm's alternative energy tax-oriented
investments previously recognized in other
income which is now recognized in income tax
expense.
Both periods included impairment losses related
to certain equity investments.
The prior year included a gain of $339 million
on the original minority interest in China
International Fund Management ("CIFM"),
partially offset by net investment valuation
losses, both in AWM.
Refer to AWM segment results on pages 84–87 for
additional information on CIFM; Notes 1, 6, 14
and 25 for additional information on the
adoption of updates to the Accounting for
Investments in Tax Credit Structures guidance;
Notes 2 and 6 for additional information on Visa
shares; and Notes 6 and 34 for additional
information on the First Republic acquisition.
Net interest income increased driven by the
impact of balance sheet actions, primarily
reinvestments in the investment securities
portfolio, higher revolving balances in Card
Services, the timing impact of First Republic,
higher wholesale deposit balances and higher
Markets net interest income. These factors were
largely offset by deposit margin compression
across the lines of business and lower average
deposit balances in CCB.
The Firm’s average interest-earning assets were
$3.5 trillion, up $212 billion, and the yield
was 5.50%, up 36 bps. The net yield on these
assets, on an FTE basis, was 2.63%, a decrease
of 7 bps. The net yield excluding Markets was
3.84%, relatively flat when compared to the
prior year.
Refer to the Consolidated average balance
sheets, interest and rates schedule on pages
322–326 for additional information. Net yield
excluding Markets is a non-GAAP financial
measure. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation
of the Firm’s Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
on pages 67–69 for an additional discussion of
net yield excluding Markets.

2024 compared with 2023 The provision for credit losses was $10.7 billion, reflecting $8.6 billion of
net charge-offs and a $2.0 billion net addition to the allowance for credit losses. Net charge-offs
included $7.8 billion in consumer , predominantly driven by Card Services, reflecting the seasoning
of vintages originated in recent years, credit normalization and balance growth, and $0.8 billion in
wholesale , primarily in Real Estate, largely concentrated in Office. The net addition to the
allowance for credit losses consisted of: • $2.1 billion in consumer , reflecting: – a $2.2 billion
net addition in Card Services, predominantly driven by loan growth, reflecting higher revolving
balances, including the seasoning of vintages originated in recent years, partially offset by – a
$125 million net reduction in Home Lending in the first quarter of 2024, and • a net reduction of $19
million in wholesale , reflecting: – changes in certain macroeconomic variables, an update to loss
assumptions on certain loans in Markets, and a reduction due to charge-offs largely from collateral-
dependent loans, predominantly offset by – net downgrade activity, primarily in Real Estate, and the
impact of incorporating the First Republic portfolio into the Firm’s modeled credit loss estimates in
the second quarter of 2024.
The provision in the prior year was $9.3 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of $6.2 billion and a
$3.1 billion net addition to the allowance for credit losses, which included $1.2 billion to
establish the allowance for the First Republic loans and lending-related commitments in the second
quarter of 2023. Refer to CCB, CIB and AWM segment and Corporate results on pages 73–76, pages 77–83,

$1.0 billion contribution of Visa shares to the
JPMorgan Chase Foundation recorded in the second
quarter of 2024. Refer to Notes 2 and 6 for
additional information. 2024 compared with 2023
Compensation expense increased driven by: •
higher revenue-related compensation across the
LOBs, • growth in the number of employees across
the LOBs and Corporate, primarily in front
office and technology, and • the impact of First
Republic, predominantly in CCB, reflecting
timing and the classification of the prior-year
expense, which was recognized in other expense
in Corporate in the second quarter of 2023 as
the individuals associated with First Republic
were not employees of the Firm until July 2023.
Noncompensation expense decreased as a result
of: • lower FDIC-related expense recognized in
Corporate, which included the impact of a $2.9
billion special assessment recognized in the
fourth quarter of 2023, compared with a $725
million increase to the FDIC special assessment
recognized in the first quarter of 2024, and •
lower legal expense, reflecting the net impact
of declines in CCB, CIB and Corporate, and an
increase in AWM, predominantly offset by • a
$1.0 billion contribution of Visa shares to the
JPMorgan Chase Foundation recorded in the second
quarter of 2024 in Corporate,
• higher investments in technology in the
businesses, as well as marketing, predominantly
in CCB, • higher occupancy expense, which
included the impact of net additions to the
Firm's properties, • higher distribution fees in
AWM and brokerage expense in CIB, and • the
timing impact associated with First Republic,
offset by the alignment of expense to
compensation expense, as noted above. Refer to
Notes 2 and 6 for additional information on Visa
shares; Note 6 for additional information on
other expense; and Note 34 for additional

the amortization of certain of the Firm’s
alternative energy tax-oriented investments is
now recognized in income tax expense. Refer to
Notes 1, 6, 14 and 25 for additional
information. 2024 compared with 2023 The
effective tax rate increased predominantly
driven by: • the adoption of updates to the
Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit
Structures guidance on January 1, 2024, and • a
higher level of pretax income and changes in the
mix of income and expenses subject to U.S.
federal, state and local taxes, including the
impact of the net gain on Visa shares and the
contribution of Visa shares to the JPMorgan
Chase Foundation recorded in the second quarter
of 2024. The prior year included the impact to
income tax expense associated with the First
Republic acquisition that was reflected in the
estimated bargain purchase gain, and an income
tax benefit related to the finalization of
certain income tax regulations, both of which
resulted in a reduction in the Firm's effective
tax rate. Refer to Note 25 for additional

 Total assets $ 4,002,814 $ 3,875,393 3 % 
Cash and due from banks and deposits with banks
decreased driven by higher investment securities
in Treasury and CIO, and Markets activities in
CIB.
Federal funds sold and securities purchased
under resale agreements increased driven by
Markets, reflecting higher client-driven market-
making activities.
Securities borrowed increased driven by Markets,
reflecting a higher demand for securities to
cover short positions.
Refer to Note 11 for additional information on
securities purchased under resale agreements and
securities borrowed.
Trading assets increased predominantly due to
higher levels of debt and equity instruments in
Markets related to client-driven market-making
activities. Refer to Notes 2 and 5 for
additional information.
Investment securities increased due to:
• higher available-for-sale ("AFS") securities,
reflecting net purchases, primarily U.S.
Treasuries and non-U.S. government debt
securities, partially offset by maturities and
paydowns, and
• lower held to-maturity (“HTM”) securities
driven by maturities and paydowns.
Refer to Corporate results on pages 88–90,
Investment Portfolio Risk Management on page
140, and Notes 2 and 10 for additional
information.
Loans increased, reflecting:
• higher outstanding balances in Card Services
driven by growth in new accounts and
normalization of revolving balances,
• higher wholesale loans in CIB, and
• higher securities-based lending in AWM due to
higher client demand,
partially offset by
• a decline in Home Lending as paydowns and loan
sales outpaced originations.
The allowance for loan losses increased,
reflecting a net addition to the allowance for
loan losses of $1.9 billion, consisting of:
• $2.1 billion net addition in consumer ,
primarily in Card Services, predominantly driven
by loan growth, reflecting higher revolving
balances, including the seasoning of vintages
originated in recent years, partially offset by
a net reduction in Home Lending in the first
quarter of 2024, and
• a net reduction of $176 million in wholesale ,
reflecting:
– changes in certain macroeconomic variables, an
update to loss assumptions on certain loans in
 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K 63 
Markets, and a reduction due to charge-offs
largely from collateral-dependent loans,
predominantly offset by
– net downgrade activity, primarily in Real
Estate, and the impact of incorporating the
First Republic portfolio into the Firm’s modeled
credit loss estimates in the second quarter of
2024.
There was also a $128 million net addition to
the allowance for lending-related commitments
recognized in other liabilities on the
Consolidated balance sheets.
Refer to Consolidated Results of Operations and
Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages
59–62 and pages 117–140, respectively, Critical
Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm on pages
161–164, and Notes 2, 3, 12 and 13 for
additional information on loans and the total
allowance for credit losses.
Accrued interest and accounts receivable
decreased primarily driven by lower receivables
in Payments related to the timing of processing
payment activities, due to December 31, 2023
falling on a weekend, as well as lower client
receivables related to client-driven activities
in Markets .
Premises and equipment increased primarily as a
result of the construction-in-process associated
with the Firm's headquarters, and purchases of
properties. Refer to Notes 16 and 18 for
additional information.
Goodwill, MSRs and other intangibles : Refer to
Note 15 for additional information.
Other assets increased primarily due to higher
cash collateral placed with central
counterparties ("CCP") in Markets, the impact of
the adoption of updates to the Accounting for
Investments in Tax Credit Structures guidance
effective January 1, 2024, and higher auto
operating lease assets in CCB. Refer to Notes 1,

Deposits increased, reflecting:
• an increase in CIB due to net inflows
predominantly in Payments, largely offset by net
maturities of structured notes in Markets,
• an increase in AWM as a result of growth in
balances in new and existing client accounts,
reflecting the impact of higher-yielding product
offerings, largely offset by continued migration
into other investments, and
• a decline in CCB primarily driven by a
decrease in balances in existing accounts due to
increased customer spending and migration into
higher-yielding investments, predominantly
offset by new accounts.
Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or
sold under repurchase agreements increased
driven by Markets, reflecting higher client-
driven market-making activities and higher
secured financing of trading assets.
Short-term borrowings increased driven by
Markets, reflecting net issuance of structured
notes due to client demand, and higher financing
requirements.
Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages
108–115 for additional information on deposits,
federal funds purchased and securities loaned or
sold under repurchase agreements, and short-term
borrowings; Notes 2 and 17 for deposits; and

Trading liabilities increased due to client-
driven market-making activities primarily in
Fixed Income Markets, which resulted in higher
levels of short positions in debt instruments.
Refer to Notes 2 and 5 for additional
information.
 64 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K 
Accounts payable and other liabilities decreased
primarily driven by lower payables in Payments
related to the timing of processing payment
activities, due to December 31, 2023 falling on
a weekend , as well as lower client payables
related to client-driven activities in Markets,
partially offset by the impact of the adoption
of updates to the Accounting for Investments in
Tax Credit Structures guidance effective January
1, 2024. Refer to Note 19 for additional
information on accounts payable; and Notes 1, 6,
14 and 25 for additional information on updates
to the accounting guidance.
Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs
increased driven by the issuance of credit card
securitizations in Treasury and CIO, and
activity in municipal bond vehicles in CIB.
Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages
108–115; and Notes 14 and 28 for additional
information on Firm-sponsored VIEs and loan
securitization trusts.
Long-term debt increased, primarily driven by:
• net issuances of structured notes in Markets
due to client demand,
partially offset by
• a decline in Treasury and CIO, reflecting the
net impact of lower FHLB advances and higher
long-term debt from net issuances.
Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages
108–115 and Note 34 for additional information
on the First Republic acquisition.
Stockholders’ equity increased, reflecting:
• net income,
largely offset by
• the impact of capital actions, including
repurchases of common shares, the declaration of
common and preferred stock dividends, and net
redemption of preferred stock, and
• net unrealized losses in AOCI, including the
impact of higher interest rates on cash flow
hedges in Treasury and CIO.

Operating activities JPMorganChase’s operating assets and liabilities primarily support the Firm’s
lending and capital markets activities. These assets and liabilities can vary significantly in the
normal course of business due to the amount and timing of cash flows, which are affected by client-
driven and risk management activities and market conditions. The Firm believes that cash flows from
operations, available cash and other liquidity sources, and its capacity to generate cash through
secured and unsecured sources, are sufficient to meet its operating liquidity needs. • In 2024, cash
used resulted from higher trading assets and higher securities borrowed, largely offset by net
income. • In 2023, cash provided primarily reflected net income, lower other assets, and accrued
interest and accounts receivable, predominantly offset by higher trading assets, lower accounts
payable and other liabilities, and higher securities borrowed.
Investing activities The Firm’s investing activities predominantly include originating held-for-
investment loans, investing in the investment securities portfolio and other short-term instruments.
• In 2024, cash used resulted from net purchases of investment securities, net loan originations and
higher securities purchased under resale agreements, partially offset by proceeds from sales and
securitizations of loans held-for-investment. • In 2023, cash provided resulted from net proceeds
from investment securities, proceeds from sales and securitizations of loans held-for-investment, and
lower securities purchased under resale agreements, largely offset by net originations of loans and
net cash used in the First Republic Bank acquisition. Financing activities The Firm’s financing
activities include acquiring customer deposits and issuing long-term debt and preferred stock. • In
2024, cash provided primarily reflected higher securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements
and net proceeds from long- and short-term borrowings, partially offset by net redemption of
preferred stock. • In 2023, cash used reflected lower deposits, which included the impact of the
repayment of the deposits provided to First Republic Bank by the consortium of large U.S. banks that
the Firm assumed as part of the First Republic acquisition, partially offset by higher securities
loaned under repurchase agreements and net proceeds from long- and short-term borrowings. • For both
periods, cash was used for repurchases of common stock and cash dividends on common and preferred
stock. * * * Refer to Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis on pages 63–65, Capital Risk Management on
pages 97–107, and Liquidity Risk Management on pages 108–115, and the Consolidated Statements of Cash
Flows on page 176 for a further discussion of the activities affecting the Firm’s cash flows.

 EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRM’S USE 
 OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
 Non-GAAP financial measures 
The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial
Statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP; these
financial statements appear on pages 172–176.
That presentation, which is referred to as
“reported” basis, provides the reader with an
understanding of the Firm’s results that can be
tracked consistently from year-to-year and
enables a comparison of the Firm’s performance
with the U.S. GAAP financial statements of other
companies.
In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a
reported basis, management reviews Firmwide
results, including the overhead ratio, on a
“managed” basis; these Firmwide managed basis
results are non-GAAP financial measures. The
Firm also reviews the results of the lines of
business on a managed basis. The Firm’s
definition of managed basis starts, in each
case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and
includes certain reclassifications to present
total net revenue for the Firm as a whole, and
for each of the reportable business segments and
Corporate, on an FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue
from investments that receive tax credits and
tax-exempt securities is presented in the
managed results on a basis comparable to taxable
investments and securities. These financial
measures
allow management to assess the comparability of
revenue from year-to-year arising from both
taxable and tax-exempt sources. The
corresponding income tax impact related to tax-
exempt items is recorded within income tax
expense. These adjustments have no impact on net
income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by
each of the lines of business and Corporate.
Management also uses certain non-GAAP financial
measures at the Firm and business-segment levels
because these other non-GAAP financial measures
provide information to investors about the
underlying operational performance and trends of
the Firm or of the particular business segment,
as the case may be, and therefore facilitate a
comparison of the Firm or the business segment
with the performance of its relevant
competitors. Refer to Business Segment &
Corporate Results on pages 70–90 for additional
information on these non-GAAP measures. Non-GAAP
financial measures used by the Firm may not be
comparable to similarly named non-GAAP financial
measures used by other companies.
The following summary table provides a
reconciliation from the Firm’s reported U.S.
GAAP results to managed basis.

Net interest income, net yield, and noninterest
revenue excluding Markets In addition to
reviewing net interest income, net yield, and
noninterest revenue on a managed basis,
management also reviews these metrics excluding
Markets, as shown below. Markets consists of
CIB’s Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets.
These metrics, which exclude Markets, are non-
GAAP financial measures. Management reviews
these metrics to assess the performance of the
Firm’s lending, investing (including asset-
liability management) and deposit-raising
activities, apart from any volatility associated
with Markets activities. In addition, management
also assesses Markets business performance on a
total revenue basis as offsets may occur across
revenue lines. Management believes that these
measures provide investors and analysts with
alternative measures to analyze the revenue
trends of the Firm.

 Calculation of certain U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP 
 financial measures 
 Certain U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures 
 are calculated as follows: 
 Book value per share (“BVPS”) 
 Common stockholders’ equity at period-end / 
 Common shares at period-end 
 Overhead ratio 
 Total noninterest expense / Total net revenue 
 ROA 
 Reported net income / Total average assets 
 ROE 
 Net income* / Average common stockholders’ equity 
 ROTCE 
 Net income* / Average tangible common equity 
 TBVPS 
 Tangible common equity at period-end / Common shares at period-end 
 * Represents net income applicable to common 
 equity 
In addition, the Firm reviews other non-GAAP
measures such as: • Adjusted expense, which
represents noninterest expense excluding
Firmwide legal expense, and • Pre-provision
profit, which represents total net revenue less
total noninterest expense. Management believes
that these measures help investors to understand
the effect of these items on reported results
and provide an alternative presentation of the
Firm’s performance.
 68 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K 
 TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS 
TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common
stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and
identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. ROTCE
measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average TCE. TBVPS
represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS
are utilized by the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity.

 BUSINESS SEGMENT & CORPORATE RESULTS 
The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. Effective in the second quarter of 2024, the Firm reorganized
its reportable business segments by combining the former Corporate & Investment Bank and Commercial
Banking business segments to form one reportable segment, the Commercial & Investment Bank (“CIB”).
As a result of the reorganization, the Firm has three reportable business segments – Consumer &
Community Banking, Commercial & Investment Bank, and Asset & Wealth Management – with the remaining
activities in Corporate.
The business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of
customer served, and they reflect the manner in which financial information is evaluated by the
Firm’s Operating Committee, whose members act collectively as the Firm’s chief operating decision
maker. Segment results are presented on a managed basis. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of
the Firm’s use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, on pages 67–69 for a definition of managed basis.
The following table depicts the Firm’s reportable business segments.
 Description of business segment reporting methodology 
Results of the reportable business segments are
intended to present each segment as if it were a
stand-alone business. The management reporting
process that derives business segment results
includes the allocation of certain income and
expense items. The Firm periodically assesses
the assumptions, methodologies and reporting
classifications used for segment reporting, and
therefore further refinements may be implemented
in future periods. The Firm also assesses the
level of capital required for each LOB on at
least an annual basis. The Firm’s LOBs also
provide various business metrics which are
utilized by the Firm and its investors and
analysts in assessing performance.
Revenue sharing
When business segments or businesses within each
segment join efforts to sell products and
services to the Firm’s clients and customers,
the participating businesses may agree to share
revenue from those transactions. Revenue is
generally recognized in the segment responsible
for the related product or service, with
allocations to the other segments or businesses
involved in the transaction. The segment and
business results reflect these revenue-sharing
agreements.
 70 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K 
Expense allocation
Where business segments use services provided by
Corporate support units, or another business
segment, the costs of those services are
allocated to the respective business segments.
The expense is generally allocated based on the
actual cost and use of services provided. In
contrast, certain costs and investments related
to Corporate that are not currently utilized by
any LOB are not allocated to the business
segments and are retained in Corporate. Expense
retained in Corporate generally includes costs
that would not be incurred if the segments were
stand-alone businesses, and other items not
solely aligned with a particular reportable
business segment.
Funds transfer pricing
Funds transfer pricing (“FTP”) is the process by
which the Firm allocates interest income and
expense to the LOBs and Other Corporate and
transfers the primary interest rate risk and
liquidity risk to Treasury and CIO.
The funds transfer pricing process considers the
interest rate and liquidity risk characteristics
of assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet
products. Periodically, the methodology and
assumptions utilized in the FTP process are
adjusted to reflect economic conditions and
other factors, which may impact the allocation
of net interest income to the segments.
Effective in the fourth quarter of 2024, the
Firm updated its FTP with respect to consumer
deposits, which resulted in an increase in the
funding benefit reflected within CCB’s net
interest income that is fully offset in
Corporate, with no effect on the Firm’s net
interest income.
As a result of higher average interest rates,
the cost of funds for assets and the FTP benefit
earned for liabilities have generally increased
in the current year, impacting the net interest
income of the business segments. During the
period ended December 31, 2024, this has
resulted in a higher cost of funds for loans and
Markets activities. In addition, rates paid to
deposit holders increased more than the FTP
benefit increase during the year, resulting in
deposit margin compression.
Foreign exchange risk
Foreign exchange risk is transferred from the
LOBs and Other Corporate to Treasury and CIO for

Refer to Market Risk Management on page 149 for

Debt expense and preferred stock dividend
allocation
As part of the FTP process, almost all of the
cost of the credit spread component of
outstanding unsecured long-term debt and
preferred stock dividends is allocated to the
reportable business segments, while the balance
of the cost is retained in Corporate. The
methodology to allocate the cost of unsecured
long-term debt and preferred stock dividends to
the business segments is aligned with the
relevant regulatory capital requirements and
funding needs of the LOBs, as applicable. The
allocated cost of unsecured long-term debt is
included in a business segment’s net interest
income, and net income is reduced by preferred
stock dividends, to arrive at a business
segment’s net income applicable to common
equity. Refer to Capital Risk Management on
pages 97–107 for additional information.
Capital allocation
The amount of capital assigned to each LOB and
Corporate is referred to as equity. The Firm’s
current equity allocation methodology
incorporates Basel III Standardized risk-
weighted assets (“RWA”) and the global
systemically important banks (“GSIB”) surcharge,
both under rules currently in effect, as well as
a simulation of capital depletion in a severe
stress environment. At least annually, the
assumptions, judgments and methodologies used to
allocate capital are reassessed and, as a
result, the capital allocated to the LOBs and
Corporate may change. Refer to Line of business
and Corporate equity on page 104 for additional
information on capital allocation.

 2024 compared with 2023 
Net income was $17.6 billion, down 17%.
Net revenue was $71.5 billion, up 2%.
Net interest income was $54.9 billion, flat when
compared with the prior year, reflecting:
• lower NII in Banking & Wealth Management
("BWM"), predominantly driven by deposit margin
compression and lower average deposits,
offset by
• higher Card Services NII, predominantly driven
by higher revolving balances, and
• the timing impact of First Republic in Home
Lending.
Noninterest revenue was $16.6 billion, up 10%,
predominantly driven by:
• higher asset management fees reflecting higher
average market levels, including the timing
impact of First Republic and, to a lesser
extent, net inflows, as well as higher
commissions from annuity sales in BWM,
• higher card income, driven by higher net
interchange reflecting increased debit and
credit card sales volume, and higher annual
fees, partially offset by an increase in
amortization related to new account origination
costs, as well as
• higher production revenue in Home Lending,
including the timing impact of First Republic.
Refer to Note 6 for additional information on
card income, asset management fees, and
commissions and other fees; and Critical
Accounting Estimates on pages 161–164 for
additional information on the credit card
rewards liability.
Refer to Executive Overview on page 54 and Note
34 for additional information on First Republic.
Noninterest expense was $38.0 billion, up 9%,
reflecting First Republic-related expense that
was aligned to CCB from Corporate starting in
the third quarter of 2023, impacting both
compensation and noncompensation expense.
The increase in expense also reflected:
• higher compensation expense, largely driven by
higher revenue-related compensation
predominantly for advisors and bankers, and an
increase in the number of employees, including
in technology, and
• higher noncompensation expense, largely driven
by continued investments in technology and
marketing, as well as higher operating losses,
partially offset by lower legal expense.
The provision for credit losses was $10.0
billion, reflecting:
• net charge-offs of $7.9 billion, up $2.6
billion, including $2.4 billion in Card
Services, reflecting the seasoning of vintages
originated in recent years, credit normalization
and balance growth, and
• a $2.0 billion net addition to the allowance
for credit losses, consisting of:
– $2.2 billion in Card Services, predominantly
driven by loan growth, reflecting higher
revolving balances, including the seasoning of
vintages originated in recent years,
partially offset by
– a $125 million net reduction in Home Lending,
primarily due to improvements in the outlook for
home prices in the first quarter of 2024.
The provision in the prior year was $6.9
billion, reflecting net charge-offs of $5.3
billion, a $1.2 billion net addition to the
allowance for credit losses, predominantly
driven by Card Services, and a $408 million net
addition to the allowance for credit losses to
establish the allowance for the First Republic
loans and lending-related commitments in the
second quarter of 2023.
Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management
on pages 117–140 and Allowance for Credit Losses
on pages 137–139 for a further discussion of the

losses.

• Payments revenue was $18.1 billion, up 1%,
driven by fee growth on higher volumes as well
as higher average deposits, predominantly offset
by deposit margin compression, reflecting higher
rates paid, and higher deposit-related client
credits.
• Lending revenue was $7.5 billion, up 8%,
predominantly driven by the impacts of higher
rates and the First Republic acquisition.
Markets & Securities Services revenue was $34.8
billion, up 7%. Markets revenue was $30.0
billion, up 7%.
• Equity Markets revenue was $9.9 billion, up
13%, driven by higher revenue in Equity
Derivatives and Prime Finance.
• Fixed Income Markets revenue was $20.1
billion, up 5%, driven by higher revenue in the
Securitized Products Group, Currencies &
Emerging Markets, and Credit, largely offset by
lower revenue in Rates and Commodities.
• Securities Services revenue was $5.1 billion,
up 7%, predominantly driven by fee growth on
higher client activity and market levels.
• Credit Adjustments & Other was a loss of $244
million, compared with a loss of $280 million in
the prior year.
Noninterest expense was $35.4 billion, up 4%,
driven by higher compensation expense, including
revenue-related compensation and an increase in
the number of employees, as well as higher
technology and brokerage expense partially
offset by lower legal expense.
The provision for credit losses was $762
million, reflecting:
• net charge-offs of $617 million, primarily in
Real Estate, largely concentrated in Office, and
• a $145 million net addition to the allowance
for credit losses, driven by
– net downgrade activity, primarily in Real
Estate, and the impact of incorporating the
First Republic portfolio into the Firm's modeled
credit loss estimates in the second quarter of
2024,
predominantly offset by
– changes in certain macroeconomic variables, an
update to loss assumptions on certain loans in
Markets, and a reduction due to charge-offs
predominantly from collateral-dependent loans.
The provision in the prior year was $2.1
billion, reflecting a $1.5 billion net addition
to the allowance for credit losses, which
included $608 million to establish the allowance
for the First Republic loans and lending-related
commitments in the second quarter of 2023, and
net charge-offs of $588 million.

 Markets revenue 
The following table summarizes selected income
statement data for the Markets businesses.
Markets includes both Fixed Income Markets and
Equity Markets. Markets revenue consists of
principal transactions, fees, commissions and
other income, as well as net interest income.
The Firm assesses its Markets business
performance on a total revenue basis, as offsets
generally occur across revenue line items. For
example, securities that generate net interest
income may be risk-managed by derivatives that
are reflected at fair value in principal
transactions revenue. Refer to Notes 6 and 7 for
a description of the composition of these income
statement line items.
Principal transactions reflects revenue on
financial instruments and commodities
transactions that arise from client-driven
market-making activity. Principal transactions
revenue includes amounts recognized upon
executing new transactions with market
participants, as well as “inventory-related
revenue,” which is revenue recognized from gains
and losses on derivatives and other instruments
that the Firm has been holding in anticipation
of, or in response to, client demand, and
changes in the fair value of instruments
used by the Firm to actively manage the risk
exposure arising from such inventory. Principal
transactions revenue recognized upon executing
new transactions with market participants is
affected by many factors including the level of
client activity, the bid-offer spread (which is
the difference between the price at which a
market participant is willing and able to sell
an instrument to the Firm and the price at which
another market participant is willing and able
to buy it from the Firm, and vice versa), market
liquidity and volatility. These factors are
interrelated and sensitive to the same factors
that drive inventory-related revenue, which
include general market conditions, such as
interest rates, foreign exchange rates, credit
spreads, and equity and commodity prices, as
well as other macroeconomic conditions.

(a) The decline in Equity Markets net interest income was driven by higher funding costs.
(b) Markets consists of Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Loss days represent the number of
days for which Markets recorded losses in total net revenue, which includes revenue related to both
trading and non-trading positions. The loss days determined under this measure differ from the
measure used to determine backtesting gains and losses. Daily backtesting gains and losses include
positions in the Firm’s Risk Management value-at-risk ("VaR") measure and exclude certain components
of total net revenue, which may more than offset backtesting gains or losses on a particular day. For
more information on daily backtesting gains and losses, refer to the VaR discussion on pages 143–145.
(c) In the fourth quarter of 2024, certain net funding costs that were previously allocated to Fixed
Income Markets were reclassified to Equity Markets. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform
with the current presentation.

(a) Includes the amortization of the fair value discount on certain acquired lending-related
commitments associated with First Republic. The discount is deferred in other liabilities and
recognized on a straight-line basis over the commitment period and was largely recognized in 2023 as
the commitments were generally short term. Refer to Note 34 for additional information. (b) Includes
the gain on the original minority interest in CIFM upon the Firm’s acquisition of the remaining 51%
interest in the entity.
2024 compared with 2023 Net income was $5.4 billion, up 4%. Net revenue was $21.6 billion, up 9%. Net
interest income was $6.6 billion, up 5%. Noninterest revenue was $15.0 billion, up 11%. Revenue from
Asset Management was $10.2 billion, up 11%, driven by: • higher asset management fees, reflecting
higher average market levels and strong net inflows, as well as • higher performance fees. The prior
year included a gain of $339 million on the original minority interest in CIFM upon the Firm’s
acquisition of the remaining 51% interest in the entity. Revenue from Global Private Bank was $11.4
billion, up 7%, driven by: • higher noninterest revenue, reflecting: – higher management fees on
strong net inflows and higher average market levels, as well as higher brokerage fees, partially
offset by – a decline in the amortization of the fair value discount on certain acquired lending-
related commitments associated with First Republic that have expired, and • higher net interest
income driven by: – higher average deposits associated with First Republic, which were transferred to
AWM from CCB in the fourth quarter of 2023, as well as wider spreads on loans and higher average
loans, largely offset by – deposit margin compression reflecting higher rates paid. The prior year
included net investment valuation losses. Noninterest expense was $14.4 billion, up 13%,
predominantly driven by: • higher compensation, including revenue-related compensation, and continued
growth in private banking advisor teams, and • higher distribution fees and legal expense, The
provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $68 million. The provision in the prior year was
$159 million, reflecting a $146 million addition to the allowance for credit losses to establish the
allowance for the First Republic loans and lending-related commitments in the second quarter of 2023.

 Asset Management has two high-level measures of 
 its overall fund performance. 
 •Percentage of active mutual fund and active ETF 
 assets under management in funds rated 4- or 
 5-star: 
 Mutual fund rating services rank funds based on 
 their risk adjusted performance over various 
 periods. A 5-star rating is the best rating and 
 represents the top 10% of industry-wide ranked 
 funds. A 4-star rating represents the next 22.5% 
 of industry-wide ranked funds. A 3-star rating 
 represents the next 35% of industry-wide ranked 
 funds. A 2-star rating represents the next 22.5% 
 of industry-wide ranked funds. A 1-star rating is 
 the worst rating and represents the bottom 10% of 
 industry-wide ranked funds. An overall Morningstar 
 rating is derived from a weighted average of the 
 performance associated with a fund’s three-, five 
 and ten- year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating 
 metrics. For U.S.-domiciled funds, separate star 
 ratings are provided at the individual share class 
 level. The Nomura “star rating” is based on 
 three-year risk-adjusted performance only. Funds 
 with fewer than three years of history are not 
 rated and hence excluded from these rankings. All 
 ratings, the assigned peer categories and the 
 asset values used to derive these rankings are 
 sourced from the applicable fund rating provider. 
 Where applicable, the fund rating providers 
 redenominate asset values into U.S. dollars. The 
 percentage of AUM is based on star ratings at the 
 share class level for U.S.-domiciled funds, and at 
 a “primary share class” level to represent the 
 star rating of all other funds, except for Japan, 
 for which Nomura provides ratings at the fund 
 level. The performance data may have been 
 different if all share classes had been included. 
 Past performance is not indicative of future 
 results. 
 •Percentage of active mutual fund and active ETF 
 assets under management in funds ranked in the 1st 
 or 2nd quartile (one, three and five years): 
 All quartile rankings, the assigned peer 
 categories and the asset values used to derive 
 these rankings are sourced from the fund rating 
 providers. Quartile rankings are based on the 
 net-of-fee absolute return of each fund. Where 
 applicable, the fund rating providers redenominate 
 asset values into U.S. dollars. The percentage of 
 AUM is based on fund performance and associated 
 peer rankings at the share class level for 
 U.S.-domiciled funds, at a “primary share class” 
 level to represent the quartile ranking for U.K., 
 Luxembourg and Hong Kong SAR funds and at the fund 
 level for all other funds. The performance data 
 may have been different if all share classes had 
 been included. Past performance is not indicative 
 of future results. 
 “Primary share class” means the C share class for 
 European funds and Acc share class for Hong Kong 
 SAR and Taiwan funds. If these share classes are 
 not available, the oldest share class is used as 
 the primary share class.

 2024 compared with 2023 
Net income was $10.6 billion, compared with $2.8
billion in the prior year.
Net revenue was $17.4 billion, compared with
$8.0 billion in the prior year.
Net interest income was $9.8 billion, up 24%,
driven by the impact of balance sheet actions,
primarily reinvestments in the investment
securities portfolio, partially offset by the
net impact of rates.
Noninterest revenue was $7.6 billion, compared
with $132 million in the prior year. Excluding
the $7.9 billion net gain related to Visa shares
recorded in the second quarter of 2024 and the
prior-year $2.8 billion estimated bargain
purchase gain associated with the First Republic
acquisition, revenue was up $2.4 billion,
predominantly driven by lower investment
securities losses, primarily on sales of U.S.
Treasuries and U.S. GSE and government agency
MBS, associated with repositioning the
investment securities portfolio in Treasury and
CIO.
Noninterest expense was $4.0 billion, down 29%,
driven by:
• a lower FDIC special assessment,
• lower expense associated with the First
Republic acquisition as the prior year expense
in Corporate included individuals associated
with First Republic who were not employees of
the Firm until July 2023, and this expense was
subsequently aligned to the appropriate LOBs
starting in the third quarter of 2023, and
• lower legal expense,
partially offset by
• a $1.0 billion contribution of Visa shares to
the JPMorgan Chase Foundation recorded in the
second quarter of 2024, and
• higher costs associated with the Firm's
international consumer initiatives.
The provision for credit losses was $10 million.
The provision in the prior year was $171
million, reflecting a net addition to the
allowance for credit losses related to a single
name exposure, which was subsequently charged
off upon the restructuring of a loan.
Refer to Note 10 and Note 13 for additional
information on the investment securities
portfolio and the allowance for credit losses.
The current period income tax expense was driven
by changes in the level and mix of income and
expenses subject to U.S. federal and state and
local taxes, including the impact of the net
gain on Visa shares and the contribution of Visa
shares to the JPMorgan Chase Foundation recorded
in the second quarter of 2024, partially offset
by benefits related to tax audit settlements.
Other Corporate includes the Firm's
international consumer initiatives, which
primarily consists of Chase U.K., Nutmeg, and an
ownership stake in C6 Bank.
The deposits within Corporate relate to the
Firm’s international consumer initiatives and
have increased as a result of growth in client
accounts, reflecting the impact of additional
product offerings.
 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K 89 
Treasury and CIO overview Treasury and CIO is predominantly responsible for measuring, monitoring,
reporting and managing the Firm’s liquidity, funding, capital, structural interest rate and foreign
exchange risks. The risks managed by Treasury and CIO arise from the activities undertaken by the
Firm’s three reportable business segments to serve their respective client bases, which generate both
on- and off-balance sheet assets and liabilities. Treasury and CIO seeks to achieve the Firm’s asset-
liability management objectives generally by investing in high quality securities that are managed
for the longer-term as part of the Firm’s investment securities portfolio. Treasury and CIO also uses
derivatives to meet the Firm ’ s asset-liability management objectives. Refer to Note 5 for further
information on derivatives. In addition, Treasury and CIO manages the Firm’s cash position primarily
through deposits at central banks and investments in short-term instruments. Refer to Liq uidity Risk
Management on pages 108–115 for further information on liquidity and funding risk . R efer to Market
Risk Management on pages 141–149 for informatio n on interest rate and foreign exchange risks. The
investment securities portfolio predominantly consists of U.S. and non-U.S. government securities,
U.S. GSE and government agency and nonagency mortgage-backed securities, collateralized loan
obligations, obligations of U.S. states and municipalities and other ABS. At December 31, 2024, the
Treasury and CIO investment securities portfolio, net of the allowance for credit losses, was $678.3
billion, and the average credit rating of the securities comprising the portfolio was AA+ (based upon
external ratings where available and, where not available, based primarily upon internal risk
ratings). Refer to Note 10 for further information on the Firm’s investment securities portfolio and
internal risk ratings.

 FIRMWIDE RISK MANAGEMENT 
Risk is an inherent part of JPMorganChase’s
business activities. When the Firm extends a
consumer or wholesale loan, advises customers
and clients on their investment decisions, makes
markets in securities, or offers other products
or services, the Firm takes on some degree of
risk. The Firm’s overall objective is to manage
its business, and the associated risks, in a
manner that balances serving the interests of
its clients, customers and investors, and
protecting the safety and soundness of the Firm.
The Firm believes that effective risk management
requires, among other things:
• Acceptance of responsibility, including
identification and escalation of risks by all
individuals within the Firm;
• Ownership of risk identification, assessment,
data and management within each of the LOBs and
Corporate; and
• A Firmwide risk governance and oversight
structure.
The Firm follows a disciplined and balanced
compensation framework with strong internal
governance and independent oversight by the
Board of Directors (the “Board”). The impact of
risk and control issues is carefully considered
in the Firm’s performance evaluation and
incentive compensation processes.
 Risk governance framework 
The Firm’s risk governance framework involves
understanding drivers of risks, types of risks
and impacts of risks.
Drivers of risks are factors that cause a risk
to exist. Drivers of risks include the economic
environment, regulatory or government policy,
competitor or market evolution, business
decisions, process or judgment error, deliberate
wrongdoing, dysfunctional markets and natural
disasters.
Types of risks are categories by which risks
manifest themselves. The Firm’s risks are
generally categorized in the following four risk
types:
• Strategic risk is the risk to earnings,
capital, liquidity or reputation associated with
poorly-designed or failed business plans or an
inadequate response to changes in the operating
environment.
• Credit and investment risk is the risk
associated with the default or change in credit
profile of a client, counterparty or customer;
or loss of principal or a reduction in expected
returns on investments, including consumer
credit risk, wholesale credit risk and
investment portfolio risk.
• Market risk is the risk associated with the
effect of changes in market factors, such as
interest and foreign exchange rates, equity and
commodity prices, credit spreads or implied
volatilities, on the value of assets and
liabilities held for both the short and long
term.
• Operational risk is the risk of an adverse
outcome resulting from inadequate or failed
internal processes or systems; human factors; or
external events impacting the Firm’s processes
or systems. Operational risk includes
cybersecurity, compliance, conduct, legal, and
estimations and model risk.
Impacts of risks are consequences of risks, both
quantitative and qualitative. There may be many
consequences when risks manifest themselves,
including quantitative impacts such as a
reduction in earnings and capital, liquidity
outflows, and fines or penalties, or qualitative
impacts such as damage to the Firm’s reputation,
loss of clients and customers, and regulatory
and enforcement actions.
The Firm’s risk governance framework is managed
on a Firmwide basis. The Firm has an Independent
Risk Management (“IRM”) function, which is
comprised of Risk Management and Compliance. The
Firm’s Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) appoints,
subject to approval by the Risk Committee of the
Board of Directors (the “Board Risk Committee”),
the Firm’s Chief Risk Officer (“CRO”) to lead
the IRM function and maintain the risk
governance framework of the Firm. The framework
is subject to approval by the Board Risk
Committee through its review and approval of the
Risk Governance and Oversight Policy.
The Firm’s CRO oversees and delegates authority
to the Firmwide Risk Executives (“FREs”), the
Chief Risk Officers of the LOBs and Corporate
(“LOB CROs”), and the Firm’s Chief Compliance
Officer (“CCO”), who, in turn, establish Risk
Management and Compliance organizations, develop
the Firm’s risk governance policies and
standards, and define and oversee the
implementation of the Firm’s risk governance
framework. The LOB CROs oversee risks that arise
in their LOBs and Corporate, while FREs oversee
risks that span across the LOBs and Corporate,
as well as functions and regions. Each area of
the Firm that gives rise to risk is expected to
operate within the parameters identified by the
IRM function, and within the risk and control
standards established by its own management.
 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K 91 
 Management’s discussion and analysis 
 Three lines of defense 
The Firm’s “three lines of defense” are as
follows:
The first line of defense consists of each LOB,
Treasury and CIO, and certain Other Corporate
initiatives, including their aligned Operations,
Technology and Control Management. The first
line of defense owns the risks, and
identification of risks, associated with their
respective activities and the design and
execution of controls to manage those risks.
Responsibilities also include adherence to
applicable laws, rules and regulations and
implementation of the risk governance framework
established by IRM, which may include policies,
standards, limits, thresholds and controls.
The second line of defense is the IRM function,
which is separate from the first line of defense
and is responsible for independently measuring
risk, as well as assessing and challenging the
risk management activities of the first line of
defense. IRM is also responsible for the
identification of risks within its organization,
its own adherence to applicable laws, rules and
regulations and for the development and
implementation of policies and standards with
respect to its own processes.
The third line of defense is Internal Audit, an
independent function that provides objective
assessment of the adequacy and effectiveness of
Firmwide processes, controls, governance and
risk management. The Internal Audit function is
led by the General Auditor, who reports to the
Audit Committee and administratively to the CEO.
In addition, there are other functions that
contribute to the Firmwide control environment
but are not considered part of a particular line
of defense, including Corporate Finance, Human
Resources and Legal. These other functions are
responsible for the identification of risks
within their respective organizations, adherence
to applicable laws, rules and regulations and
implementation of the risk governance framework
established by IRM.
 Risk identification and ownership 
The LOBs and Corporate are responsible for the
identification of risks within their respective
organizations, as well as the design and
execution of controls, including IRM-specified
controls, to manage those risks. To support this
activity, the Firm has a risk identification
framework designed to facilitate the
responsibility of each LOB and Corporate to
identify material risks inherent to the Firm’s
businesses and operational activities, catalog
them in a central repository and review material
risks on a regular basis. The IRM function
reviews and challenges the risks identified by
each LOB and Corporate, maintains the central
repository and provides the consolidated
Firmwide results to the Firmwide Risk Committee
(“FRC”) and the Board Risk Committee.
 Risk appetite 
The Firm’s overall appetite for risk is governed
by Risk Appetite frameworks for quantitative and
qualitative risks. The Firm’s risk appetite is
periodically set and approved by senior
management (including the CEO and CRO) and
approved by the Board Risk Committee.
Quantitative and qualitative risks are assessed
to monitor and measure the Firm’s capacity to
take risk consistent with its stated risk
appetite. Risk appetite results are reported to
the Board Risk Committee.
 92 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K 
 Risk governance and oversight structure 
The independent status of the IRM function is
supported by a risk governance and oversight
structure that provides channels for the
escalation of risks and issues to senior
management, the FRC and the Board of Directors,
as appropriate.
The chart below illustrates the principal
standing committees of the Board of Directors
and key senior management-level committees in
the Firm’s risk governance and oversight
structure. In addition, there are other
committees, forums and channels of escalation
that support the oversight of risk that are not
shown in the chart below or described in this
Form 10-K.
The Firm’s Operating Committee, which consists
of the Firm’s CEO, CRO, Chief Financial Officer
(“CFO”), General Counsel, CEOs of the LOBs and
other senior executives, is accountable to and
may refer matters to the Firm’s Board of
Directors. The Operating Committee and certain
other members of senior management are
responsible for escalating to the Board the
information necessary to facilitate the Board’s
exercise of its duties.
 Board oversight 
The Firm’s Board of Directors actively oversees
the business and affairs of the Firm. This
includes monitoring the Firm’s financial
performance and condition and reviewing the
strategic objectives and plans of the Firm. The
Board carries out a significant portion of its
oversight responsibilities through its principal
standing committees, each of which consists
solely of independent members of the Board. The
Board Risk Committee is the principal committee
that oversees risk matters. The Audit Committee
oversees the control environment, and the
Compensation & Management Development Committee
oversees compensation and other management-
related
matters. Each committee of the Board oversees
reputation risks, conduct risks, and
environmental, social and governance (“ESG”)
matters within its scope of responsibility.
The JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Board of Directors
is responsible for the oversight of management
of the bank, which it discharges both acting
directly and through the principal standing
committees of the Firm’s Board of Directors.
Risk and control oversight on behalf of JPMorgan
Chase Bank N.A. is primarily the responsibility
of the Board Risk Committee and the Audit
Committee, respectively, and, with respect to
compensation and other management-related
matters, the Compensation & Management
Development Committee.
The Board Risk Committee assists the Board in
its oversight of management’s responsibility to
implement a global risk management framework
reasonably designed to identify, assess and
manage the Firm’s risks. The Board Risk
Committee’s responsibilities include approval of
applicable primary risk policies and review of
certain associated frameworks, analysis and
reporting established by
 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K 93 
 Management’s discussion and analysis 
management. Breaches in risk appetite and
parameters, issues that may have a material
adverse impact on the Firm, including capital
and liquidity issues, and other significant
risk-related matters are escalated to the Board
Risk Committee, as appropriate.
The Audit Committee assists the Board in its
oversight of management’s responsibilities to
ensure that there is an effective system of
controls reasonably designed to safeguard the
Firm’s assets and income, ensure the integrity
of the Firm’s financial statements, and maintain
compliance with the Firm’s ethical standards,
policies, plans and procedures, and with laws
and regulations. It also assists the Board in
its oversight of the qualifications,
independence and performance of the Firm’s
independent registered public accounting firm,
and of the performance of the Firm’s Internal
Audit function.
The Compensation & Management Development
Committee (“CMDC”) assists the Board in its
oversight of the Firm’s compensation principles
and practices. The CMDC reviews and approves the
Firm’s compensation and qualified benefits
programs. The Committee reviews the performance
of Operating Committee members against their
goals, and approves their compensation awards.
In addition, the CEO’s compensation award is
subject to ratification by the independent
directors of the Board. The CMDC also reviews
the development of and succession for key
executives. As part of the Board’s role of
reinforcing, demonstrating and communicating the
“tone at the top,” the CMDC oversees the Firm’s
culture, including reviewing updates from
management regarding significant conduct issues
and any related actions with respect to
employees, including compensation actions.
The Public Responsibility Committee oversees and
reviews the Firm's positions and practices on
public responsibility matters such as community
investment, fair lending, sustainability,
consumer practices and other public policy
issues that reflect the Firm's values and
character and could impact the Firm's reputation
among its stakeholders. The Committee also
provides guidance on these matters to management
and the Board, as appropriate.
The Corporate Governance & Nominating Committee
exercises general oversight with respect to the
governance of the Board of Directors. It reviews
the qualifications of and recommends to the
Board proposed nominees for election to the
Board. The Committee evaluates and recommends to
the Board corporate governance practices
applicable to the Firm. It also reviews the
framework for assessing the Board’s performance
and self-evaluation.

that are primarily responsible for key risk-
related functions include:
The Firmwide Risk Committee (“FRC”) is the
Firm’s highest management-level risk committee.
It oversees the risks inherent in the Firm’s
business and provides a forum for discussion of
risk-related and other topics and issues that
are raised or escalated by its members and other
committees.
The Firmwide Control Committee (“FCC”) is an
escalation committee for senior management to
review and discuss the Firmwide compliance and
operational risk environment, including
identified issues, compliance and operational
risk metrics and significant events that have
been escalated.
Line of Business and Regional Risk Committees
are responsible for overseeing the governance,
limits and controls that have been established
within the scope of their respective activities.
These committees review the ways in which the
particular LOB or the businesses operating in a
particular region could be exposed to adverse
outcomes, with a focus on identifying,
accepting, escalating and/or requiring
remediation of matters brought to these
committees.
 94 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K 
Line of Business and Corporate Function Control
Committees over see the risk and control
environment of their respective business or
function, inclusive of Operational Risk,
Compliance and Conduct Risks. As part of that
mandate, they are responsible for reviewing
indicators of elevated or emerging risks and
other data that may impact the level of
compliance and operational risk in a business or
function, addressing key compliance and
operational risk issues , with an emphasis on
processes with control concerns, and overseeing
control remediation. The Asset and Liability
Committee (“ALCO”) is responsible for overseeing
the Firm’s asset and liability management
(“ALM”), including the activities and frameworks
supporting management of the balance sheet,
liquidity risk, interest rate risk and capital
risk. The Firmwide Valuation Governance Forum
(“VGF”) is composed of senior finance and risk
executives and is responsible for overseeing the
management of risks arising from valuation
activities conducted across the Firm. Risk
governance and oversight functions The Firm
monitors and measures its risk through risk
governance and oversight functions. The scope of
a particular function or business activity may
include one or more drivers, types and/or
impacts of risk. For example, Country Risk
Management oversees country risk which may be a
driver of risk or an aggregation of exposures
that could give rise to multiple risk types such
as credit or market risk. The following sections
discuss the risk governance and oversight
functions that have been established to oversee
the risks inherent in the Firm’s business
activities.

 Management’s discussion and analysis 
 STRATEGIC RISK MANAGEMENT 
Strategic risk is the risk to earnings, capital,
liquidity or reputation associated with poorly-
designed or failed business plans or an
inadequate response to changes in the operating
environment.
 Management and oversight 
The Operating Committee, together with the
senior leadership of each LOB and Corporate, are
responsible for managing the Firm’s most
significant strategic risks. IRM engages
regularly in strategic business discussions and
decision-making, including participation in
relevant business reviews and senior management
meetings, risk and control committees and other
relevant governance forums, and review of
acquisitions and new business initiatives. The
Board of Directors oversees management’s
strategic decisions, and the Board Risk
Committee oversees IRM and the Firm’s risk
governance framework.
In the process of developing business plans and
strategic initiatives, LOB and Corporate senior
management identify the associated risks that
are incorporated into the Firmwide Risk
Identification framework and their impact on
risk appetite.
In addition, IRM conducts a qualitative
assessment of the LOB and Corporate strategic
initiatives to assess their impact on the risk
profile of the Firm.
The Firm’s strategic planning process, which
includes the development of the Firm’s strategic
plan and other strategic initiatives, is one
component of managing the Firm’s strategic risk.
The strategic plan outlines the Firm’s strategic
framework and initiatives, and includes
components such as budget, risk appetite,
capital, earnings and asset-liability management
objectives. Guided by the Firm’s Business
Principles, the Operating Committee and senior
management teams in each LOB and Corporate
review and update the strategic plan
periodically, including evaluating the strategic
framework and performance of strategic
initiatives, assessing the operating
environment, refining existing strategies and
developing new strategies.
The Firm’s strategic plan, together with IRM’s
assessment, are provided to the Board as part of
its review and approval of the Firm’s strategic
plan, and the plan is also reflected in the
Firm's budget.
The Firm’s balance sheet strategy, which focuses
on risk-adjusted returns, strong capital and
robust liquidity, is also a component in the
management of strategic risk. Refer to Capital
Risk Management on pages 97–107 for further
information on capital risk. Refer to Liquidity
Risk Management on pages 108–115 for further
information on liquidity risk. Refer to
Reputation Risk Management on page 116 for
further information on reputation risk.

 CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT 
Capital risk is the risk that the Firm has an
insufficient level or composition of capital to
support the Firm’s business activities and
associated risks during normal economic
environments and under stressed conditions.
A strong capital position is essential to the
Firm’s business strategy and competitive
position. Maintaining a strong balance sheet to
manage through economic volatility is a
strategic imperative of the Firm’s Board of
Directors, CEO and Operating Committee. The
Firm’s “fortress balance sheet” philosophy
focuses on risk-adjusted returns, strong capital
and robust liquidity. The Firm’s capital risk
management strategy focuses on maintaining long-
term stability to enable the Firm to build and
invest in market-leading businesses, including
in highly stressed environments. Senior
management considers the implications on the
Firm’s capital prior to making significant
decisions that could impact future business
activities. In addition to considering the
Firm’s earnings outlook, senior management
evaluates all sources and uses of capital with a
view to ensuring the Firm’s capital strength.
 Capital risk management 
The Firm has a Capital Risk Management function
whose primary objective is to provide
independent oversight of capital risk across the
Firm.
Capital Risk Management’s responsibilities
include:
• Defining, monitoring and reporting capital
risk metrics;
• Establishing, calibrating and monitoring
capital risk limits and indicators, including
capital risk appetite;
• Developing processes to classify, monitor and
report capital limit breaches;
• Performing assessments of the Firm’s capital
management activities, including changes made to
the Contingency Capital Plan described below;
and
• Conducting assessments of the Firm's
regulatory capital framework intended to ensure
compliance with applicable regulatory capital
rules.
 Capital management 
Treasury and CIO is responsible for capital
management.
The primary objectives of the Firm’s capital
management are to:
• Maintain sufficient capital in order to
continue to build and invest in the Firm’s
businesses through normal economic cycles and in
stressed environments;
• Retain flexibility to take advantage of future
investment opportunities;
• Promote the Parent Company’s ability to serve
as a source of strength to its subsidiaries;
• Ensure the Firm operates above the minimum
regulatory capital ratios as well as maintain
“well-capitalized” status for the Firm and its
principal insured depository institution (“IDI”)
subsidiary, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., at all
times under applicable regulatory capital
requirements;
• Meet capital distribution objectives; and
• Maintain sufficient capital resources to
operate throughout a resolution period in
accordance with the Firm’s preferred resolution
strategy.
The Firm addresses these objectives through:
• Establishing internal minimum capital
requirements and maintaining a strong capital
governance framework. The internal minimum
capital levels consider the Firm’s regulatory
capital requirements as well as an internal
assessment of capital adequacy, in normal
economic cycles and in stress events;
• Retaining flexibility in order to react to a
range of potential events; and
• Regularly monitoring the Firm’s capital
position and following prescribed escalation
protocols, both at the Firm and material legal
entity levels.
 Governance 
Committees responsible for overseeing the Firm’s
capital management include the Capital
Governance Committee, the Firmwide ALCO as well
as regional ALCOs, and the CIO, Treasury and
Corporate (“CTC”) Risk Committee. In addition,
the Board Risk Committee periodically reviews
the Firm’s capital risk tolerance. Refer to
Firmwide Risk Management on pages 91–95 for
additional discussion of the Firmwide ALCO and
other risk-related committees.
 Capital planning and stress testing 
Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review
The Federal Reserve requires the Firm, as a
large Bank Holding Company (“BHC”), to submit at
least annually a capital plan that has been
reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors.
The Federal Reserve uses Comprehensive Capital
Analysis and Review (“CCAR”) and other stress
testing processes to assess whether large BHCs,
such as the Firm, have sufficient capital during
periods of economic and financial stress, and
have robust, forward-looking capital assessment
and planning processes in place that address
each BHC’s unique risks to enable it to absorb
losses under certain stress scenarios. Through
CCAR, the Federal Reserve evaluates each BHC’s
capital adequacy and internal capital adequacy
assessment processes (“ICAAP”), as well as its
plans to make capital distributions, such as
dividend payments or stock repurchases. The
Federal
 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K 97 
 Management’s discussion and analysis 
Reserve uses results under the severely adverse
scenario from its supervisory stress test to
determine each firm’s Stress Capital Buffer
(“SCB”) requirement for the coming year.
The Firm's current SCB requirement is 3.3% and
will remain in effect until September 30, 2025.
The Firm’s Standardized CET1 capital ratio
requirement, including regulatory buffers, was
12.3% as of December 31, 2024.
Refer to Capital actions on page 105 for
information on actions taken by the Firm’s Board
of Directors.
Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process
Annually, the Firm prepares the ICAAP, which
informs the Board of Directors of the ongoing
assessment of the Firm’s processes for managing
the sources and uses of capital as well as
compliance with supervisory expectations for
capital planning and capital adequacy. The
Firm’s ICAAP integrates stress testing protocols
with capital planning. The Firm’s Audit
Committee is responsible for reviewing and
approving the capital planning framework.
Stress testing assesses the potential impact of
alternative economic and business scenarios on
the Firm’s earnings and capital. Economic
scenarios, and the parameters underlying those
scenarios, are defined centrally and applied
uniformly across the businesses. These scenarios
are articulated in terms of macroeconomic
factors, which are key drivers of business
results; global market shocks, which generate
short-term but severe trading losses; and
idiosyncratic operational risk events. The
scenarios are intended to capture and stress key
vulnerabilities and idiosyncratic risks facing
the Firm. In addition to CCAR and other periodic
stress testing, management also considers
tailored stress scenarios and sensitivity
analyses, as necessary.
 Contingency Capital Plan 
The Firm’s Contingency Capital Plan establishes
the capital management framework for the Firm
and specifies the principles underlying the
Firm’s approach towards capital management in
normal economic conditions and in stressed
environments. The Contingency Capital Plan
defines how the Firm calibrates its targeted
capital levels and meets minimum capital
requirements, monitors the ongoing
appropriateness of planned capital
distributions, and sets out the capital
contingency actions that are expected to be
taken or considered at various levels of capital
depletion during a period of stress.
 Regulatory capital 
The Federal Reserve establishes capital
requirements, including well-capitalized
standards, for the Firm as a consolidated
financial holding company. The Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency ("OCC") establishes
similar minimum capital requirements and
standards for the Firm’s principal IDI
subsidiary, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The U.S.
capital requirements generally follow the
Capital Accord of the Basel Committee, as
amended from time to time.
Basel III Overview
The capital rules under Basel III establish
minimum capital ratios and overall capital
adequacy standards for large and internationally
active U.S. BHCs and banks, including the Firm
and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The minimum amount
of regulatory capital that must be held by BHCs
and banks is determined by calculating RWA,
which are on-balance sheet assets and off-
balance sheet exposures, weighted according to
risk. Under the rules currently in effect, two
comprehensive approaches are prescribed for
calculating RWA: a standardized approach (“Basel
III Standardized”), and an advanced approach
(“Basel III Advanced”).
For each of these risk-based capital ratios, the
capital adequacy of the Firm is evaluated
against the lower of the Standardized or
Advanced approaches compared to their respective
regulatory capital ratio requirements.
The current Basel III rules establish capital
requirements for calculating credit risk RWA and
market risk RWA, and in the case of Basel III
Advanced, operational risk RWA. Key differences
in the calculation of credit risk RWA between
the Standardized and Advanced approaches are
that for Basel III Advanced, credit risk RWA is
based on risk-sensitive approaches which largely
rely on the use of internal credit models and
parameters, whereas for Basel III Standardized,
credit risk RWA is generally based on
supervisory risk-weightings which vary primarily
by counterparty type and asset class. Market
risk RWA is generally calculated consistently
between Basel III Standardized and Basel III
Advanced. In addition to the RWA calculated
under these approaches, the Firm may supplement
such amounts to incorporate management judgment
and feedback from its regulators.
As of December 31, 2024, the Firm’s Basel III
Standardized ratios risk-based ratios were more
binding than the Basel III Advanced risk-based
ratios.
Additionally, Basel III requires that Advanced
Approaches banking organizations, including the
Firm, calculate their SLRs.
Refer to page 104 for additional information on
SLR.

Key Regulatory Developments
U.S. Basel III Finalization
In July 2023, the Federal Reserve, the OCC and
the FDIC released a proposal to amend the risk-
based capital framework, entitled "Regulatory
capital rule: Amendments applicable to large
banking organizations and to banking
organizations with significant trading
activity", which is referred to in this Form
10-K as the "U.S. Basel III proposal". Under
this proposal, changes to the framework would
include replacement of the Advanced approach
with an expanded risk-based approach for the
calculation of RWA. In addition, the stress
capital buffer requirement would be applicable
to both the expanded risk-based approach and the
Standardized approach.
GSIB Surcharge and TLAC and Eligible LTD
Requirements
In July 2023, the Federal Reserve released a
proposal to amend the calculation of the GSIB
surcharge. Under the proposal, the annual GSIB
surcharge would be based on an average of the
quarterly surcharge calculations throughout the
calendar year, with daily averaging required for
certain measures. The proposal would also reduce
surcharge increments from 50 bps to 10 bps and
includes other technical amendments to the
“Method 2” calculation. The proposed changes
would revise risk-based capital requirements for
the Firm and other U.S. GSIBs. Refer to Risk-
based Capital Regulatory Requirements on page
100 for further information on the GSIB
surcharge.
Additionally, in August 2023, the Federal
Reserve, the FDIC and the OCC released a
proposal to expand the eligible long-term debt
("eligible LTD") and clean holding company
requirements under the existing total loss-
absorbing capacity ("TLAC") rule to apply to
non-GSIB banks with $100 billion or more in
total consolidated assets. The proposal would
also reduce the amount of LTD with remaining
maturities of less than two years that count
towards a U.S. GSIB's TLAC requirement and
expand the existing capital deduction framework
for LTD issued by GSIBs to include LTD issued by
non-GSIB banks subject to the LTD requirements.
Finalization of the above proposals, including
the required implementation dates, is uncertain.
The Firm continues to monitor developments and
potential impacts.

 Management’s discussion and analysis 
Risk-based Capital Regulatory Requirements
The following chart presents the Firm’s Basel
III CET1 capital ratio requirements under the
Basel III rules currently in effect.
All banking institutions are currently required
to have a minimum CET1 capital ratio of 4.5% of
risk-weighted assets. Certain banking
organizations, including the Firm, are required
to hold additional levels of capital to serve as
a “capital conservation buffer”. The capital
conservation buffer incorporates a GSIB
surcharge, a discretionary countercyclical
capital buffer and a fixed capital conservation
buffer of 2.5% for Advanced regulatory capital
requirements, as well as a variable SCB
requirement, floored at 2.5%, for Standardized
regulatory capital requirements. Under the
Federal Reserve’s GSIB rule, the Firm is
required to assess its GSIB surcharge on an
annual basis under two separately prescribed
methods based on data for the previous fiscal
year-end, and is subject to the higher of the
two. “Method 1” reflects the GSIB surcharge as
prescribed by the Basel Committee’s assessment
methodology, and is calculated across five
criteria: size, cross-jurisdictional activity,
interconnectedness, complexity and
substitutability. “Method 2” modifies the Method
1 requirements to include a measure of short-
term wholesale funding in place of
substitutability, and introduces a GSIB score
“multiplication factor”. The following table
presents the Firm’s effective GSIB surcharge for
the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. For
2025, the Firm’s effective regulatory minimum
GSIB surcharge calculated under both
Method 1 and Method 2 remains unchanged at 2.5%
and 4.5%, respectively.
 2024 2023 
 Method 1 2.5 % 2.5 % 
 Method 2 4.5 % 4.0 % 
The U.S. federal regulatory capital standards
include a framework for setting a discretionary
countercyclical capital buffer taking into
account the macro financial environment in which
large, internationally active banks function. As
of December 31, 2024, the U.S. countercyclical
capital buffer remained at 0%. The Federal
Reserve will continue to review the buffer at
least annually. The buffer can be increased if
the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the OCC
determine that systemic risks are meaningfully
above normal and can be calibrated up to an
additional 2.5% of RWA subject to a 12-month
implementation period. Failure to maintain
regulatory capital equal to or in excess of the
risk-based regulatory capital minimum plus the
capital conservation buffer (inclusive of the
GSIB surcharge) and any countercyclical buffer
will result in limitations to the amount of
capital that the Firm may distribute, such as
through dividends and common share repurchases,
as well as on discretionary bonus payments for
certain executive officers.
 100 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K 
Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity
The Federal Reserve’s TLAC rule requires the
U.S. GSIB top-tier holding companies, including
the Firm, to maintain minimum levels of external
TLAC and eligible LTD. Refer to TLAC on page 106
for additional information.
Leverage-based Capital Regulatory Requirements
Supplementary leverage ratio
Banking organizations subject to the Basel III
Advanced approach are currently required to have
a minimum SLR of 3.0%. Certain banking
organizations, including the Firm, are also
required to hold an additional 2.0% leverage
buffer. The SLR is defined as Tier 1 capital
under Basel III divided by the Firm’s total
leverage exposure. Total leverage exposure is
calculated by taking the Firm’s total average
on-balance sheet assets, less amounts permitted
to be deducted for Tier 1 capital, and adding
certain off-balance sheet exposures, as defined
in regulatory capital rules. Refer to SLR on
page 104 for additional information.
Failure to maintain an SLR equal to or greater
than the regulatory requirement will result in
limitations on the amount of capital that the
Firm may distribute such as through dividends
and common share repurchases, as well as on
discretionary bonus payments for certain
executive officers.
Other regulatory capital
In addition to meeting the capital ratio
requirements of Basel III, the Firm and its
principal IDI subsidiary, JPMorgan Chase Bank,
N.A., must also maintain minimum capital and
leverage ratios in order to be “well-
capitalized” under the regulations issued by the
Federal Reserve and the Prompt Corrective Action
requirements of the FDIC Improvement Act,
respectively. Refer to Note 27 for additional
information.
Additional information regarding the Firm’s
capital ratios, as well as the U.S. federal
regulatory capital standards to which the Firm
is subject, is presented in Note 27. Refer to
the Firm’s Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital
Disclosures reports, which are available on the
Firm’s website, for further information on the
Firm’s current capital measures.

Capital Disclosures reports for additional
information. Line of business and Corporate
equity Each LOB and Corporate is allocated
capital by taking into consideration a variety
of factors including capital levels of similarly
rated peers and applicable regulatory capital
requirements. ROE is measured and internal
targets for expected returns are established as
key measures of an LOB’s performance.
The Firm’s current equity allocation methodology
incorporates Basel III Standardized RWA and the
GSIB surcharge, both under rules currently in
effect, as well as a simulation of capital
depletion in a severe stress environment. At
least annually, the assumptions, judgments and
methodologies used to allocate capital are
reassessed and, as a result, the capital
allocated to the LOBs and Corporate may change.
As of January 1, 2025, changes to the Firm’s
capital allocations are primarily a result of
updates to the Firm’s current capital
requirements and changes in RWA for each LOB
under rules currently in effect. Any capital
that the Firm has accumulated in excess of these
current requirements, including the capital
required to meet the potential increased
requirements of the U.S. Basel III proposal, has
been retained in Corporate in addition to its
allocated balance. The following table presents
the capital allocated to each LOB and Corporate.

part of the Capital Management governance
framework in line with the Firm’s capital
management objectives. On December 9, 2024, the
Firm announced that its Board of Directors had
declared a quarterly common stock dividend of
$1.25 per share, payable on January 31, 2025.
The Firm’s dividends are subject to approval by
the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis.
Refer to Note 21 and Note 26 for information
regarding dividend restrictions. The following

announced that its Board of Directors had
authorized a new $30 billion common share
repurchase program, effective July 1, 2024.
Through June 30, 2024, the Firm was authorized
to purchase up to $30 billion of common shares
under its previously-approved common share
repurchase program that was announced on April
13, 2022. The following table sets forth the
Firm’s repurchases of common stock for the years

the Firm temporarily suspended share repurchases, which it resumed in the first quarter of 2023 under
its common share repurchase program.
The Board of Directors’ authorization to repurchase common shares is utilized at management’s
discretion. The $30 billion common share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors does
not establish specific price targets or timetables. Management determines the amount and timing of
common share repurchases based on various factors, including market conditions; legal and regulatory
considerations affecting the amount and timing of repurchase activity; the Firm’s capital position
(taking into account goodwill and intangibles); organic capital generation; current and proposed
future capital requirements; and other investment opportunities. The amount of common shares that the
Firm repurchases in any period may be substantially more or less than the amounts estimated or
actually repurchased in prior periods, reflecting the dynamic nature of the decision-making process.
The Firm’s common share repurchases may be suspended by management at any time; and may be executed
through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, or utilizing Rule 10b5-1 plans,
which are written trading plans that the Firm may enter into from time to time under Rule 10b5-1 of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and which allow the Firm to repurchase its common shares during
periods when it may otherwise not be repurchasing common shares — for example, during internal
trading blackout periods. Refer to capital planning and stress testing on pages 97–98 for additional
information. Refer to Part II, Item 5: Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder
Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities on page 39 of this 2024 Form 10-K for additional

Other capital requirements Total Loss-Absorbing
Capacity The Federal Reserve’s TLAC rule
requires the U.S. GSIB top-tier holding
companies, including the Firm, to maintain
minimum levels of external TLAC and eligible
long-term debt. The external TLAC requirements
and the minimum level of eligible long-term debt
requirements are shown below: (a) RWA is the
greater of Standardized and Advanced compared to
their respective regulatory capital ratio
requirements. Failure to maintain TLAC equal to
or in excess of the regulatory minimum plus
applicable buffers will result in limitations on
the amount of capital that the Firm may
distribute, such as through dividends and common
share repurchases, as well as on discretionary
bonus payments for certain executive officers.

 Management’s discussion and analysis 
 LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT 
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Firm will be
unable to meet its cash and collateral needs as
they arise or that it does not have the
appropriate amount, composition and tenor of
funding and liquidity to support its assets and
liabilities.
 Liquidity risk management 
The Firm has a Liquidity Risk Management (“LRM”)
function whose primary objective is to provide
independent oversight of liquidity risk across
the Firm. Liquidity Risk Management’s
responsibilities include:
• Defining, monitoring and reporting liquidity
risk metrics;
• Independently establishing and monitoring
limits and indicators, including liquidity risk
appetite;
• Developing a process to classify, monitor and
report limit breaches;
• Performing an independent review of liquidity
risk management processes to evaluate their
adequacy and effectiveness;
• Monitoring and reporting internal Firmwide and
legal entity liquidity stress tests, regulatory
defined metrics, as well as liquidity positions,
balance sheet variances and funding activities;
and
• Approving or escalating for review new or
updated liquidity stress assumptions.
 Liquidity management 
Treasury and CIO is responsible for liquidity
management.
The primary objectives of the Firm’s liquidity
management are to:
• Ensure that the Firm’s core businesses and
material legal entities are able to operate in
support of client needs and meet contractual and
contingent financial obligations through normal
economic cycles as well as during stress events,
and
• Manage an optimal funding mix and availability
of liquidity sources.
The Firm addresses these objectives through:
• Analyzing and understanding the liquidity
characteristics of the assets and liabilities of
the Firm, LOBs, legal entities, as well as
currencies, taking into account legal,
regulatory, and operational restrictions;
• Developing and maintaining internal liquidity
stress testing assumptions;
• Defining and monitoring Firmwide and legal
entity-specific liquidity strategies, policies,
reporting and contingency funding plans;
• Managing liquidity within the Firm’s approved
limits and indicators, including liquidity risk
appetite tolerances;
• Managing compliance with regulatory
requirements related to funding and liquidity
risk; and
• Setting FTP in accordance with underlying
liquidity characteristics of balance sheet
assets and liabilities as well as certain off-
balance sheet items.
As part of the Firm’s overall liquidity
management strategy, the Firm manages liquidity
and funding using a centralized, global approach
designed to:
• Optimize liquidity sources and uses;
• Monitor exposures;
• Identify constraints on the transfer of
liquidity between the Firm’s legal entities; and
• Maintain the appropriate amount of surplus
liquidity at a Firmwide and legal entity level,
where relevant.
 Governance 
Committees responsible for liquidity governance
include the Firmwide ALCO, as well as regional
ALCOs, the Treasurer Committee, and the CTC Risk
Committee. In addition, the Board Risk Committee
reviews and recommends to the Board of
Directors, for approval, the Firm’s liquidity
risk tolerances, liquidity strategy, and
liquidity policy. Refer to Firmwide Risk
Management on pages 91–95 for further discussion
of ALCO and other risk-related committees.
 Internal stress testing 
The Firm conducts internal liquidity stress
testing to monitor liquidity positions at the
Firm and its material legal entities under a
variety of adverse scenarios, including
scenarios analyzed as part of the Firm’s
resolution and recovery planning. Internal
stress tests are produced on a daily basis, and
other stress tests are performed in response to
specific market events or concerns. Liquidity
stress tests assume all of the Firm’s
contractual financial obligations are met and
take into consideration:
• Varying levels of access to unsecured and
secured funding markets;
• Estimated non-contractual and contingent cash
outflows;
• Credit rating downgrades;
• Collateral haircuts; and
• Potential impediments to the availability and
transferability of liquidity between
jurisdictions and material legal entities such
as regulatory, legal or other restrictions.
Liquidity outflows are modeled across a range of
time horizons and currency dimensions and
contemplate both market and idiosyncratic
stresses.
Results of stress tests are considered in the
formulation of the Firm’s funding plan and
assessment of its liquidity position. The Parent
Company acts as a source of funding for the Firm
through equity and
 108 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K 
long-term debt issuances, and its intermediate
holding company, JPMorgan Chase Holdings LLC
(the “IHC”), provides funding to support the
ongoing operations of the Parent Company and its
subsidiaries. The Firm manages liquidity at the
Parent Company, the IHC, and operating
subsidiaries at levels sufficient to comply with
liquidity risk tolerances and minimum liquidity
requirements, and to manage through periods of
stress when access to normal funding sources may
be disrupted. Contingency funding plan The
Firm’s Contingency Funding Plan (“CFP”) sets out
the strategies for addressing and managing
liquidity resource needs during a liquidity
stress event and incorporates liquidity risk
limits, indicators and risk appetite tolerances.
The CFP also identifies the alternative
contingent funding and liquidity resources
available to the Firm and its legal entities in
a period of stress. LCR and HQLA The LCR rule
requires that the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank,
N.A. maintain an amount of eligible HQLA that is
sufficient to meet their respective estimated
total net cash outflows over a prospective 30
calendar-day period of significant stress.
Eligible HQLA, for purposes of calculating the
LCR, is the amount of unencumbered HQLA that
satisfy certain operational considerations as
defined in the LCR rule. HQLA primarily consist
of cash and certain high-quality liquid
securities as defined in the LCR rule. Under the
LCR rule, the amount of eligible HQLA held by
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that is in excess of
its stand-alone 100% minimum LCR requirement,
and that is not transferable to non-bank
affiliates, must be excluded from the Firm’s
reported eligible HQLA. Estimated net cash
outflows are based on standardized stress
outflow and inflow rates prescribed in the LCR
rule, which are applied to the balances of the
Firm’s assets, sources of funds, and
obligations. The LCR for both the Firm and
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is required to be a
minimum of 100%.
The following table summarizes the Firm and
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s average LCR for the
three months ended December 31, 2024, September
30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 based on the
Firm’s interpretation of the LCR framework.

JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average LCR
increased during the three months ended December

September 30, 2024, driven by activities in CIB
Markets, partially offset by lower market values
of HQLA-eligible investment securities and
funding maturities. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s
average LCR for the three months ended December
31, 2024 decreased compared with the three
months ended December 31, 2023, driven by
dividend payments to the Parent Company and
lending activity, largely offset by higher
market values of HQLA-eligible investment
securities, a reduction in unencumbered non-HQLA
AFS securities, activities in CIB Markets, and
long-term debt issuances.

average LCR may fluctuate from period to period
due to changes in their respective eligible HQLA
and estimated net cash outflows as a result of
ongoing business activity and from the impacts
of Federal Reserve actions as well as other
factors. Refer to the Firm’s U.S. LCR Disclosure
reports, which are available on the Firm’s
website, for a further discussion of the Firm’s
LCR.
 Liquidity sources 
In addition to the assets reported in the Firm’s
eligible HQLA discussed above, the Firm had
unencumbered marketable securities, such as
equity and debt securities, that the Firm
believes would be available to raise liquidity.
This includes excess eligible HQLA securities at
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are not
transferable to non-bank affiliates. The fair
value of these securities was approximately $594
billion and $649 billion as of December 31, 2024
and 2023, respectively, although the amount of
liquidity that could be raised at any particular
time would be dependent on prevailing market
conditions. The decrease compared to December
31, 2023, was driven by reductions in
unencumbered AFS securities in Treasury and CIO,
excess eligible HQLA securities at JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A., and unencumbered CIB trading
assets.
The Firm had approximately $1.4 trillion of
available cash and securities as of both
December 31, 2024 and 2023. For each respective
period, the amount was comprised of eligible
end-of-period HQLA, excluding the impact of
regulatory haircuts, of approximately $834
billion and $798 billion, and unencumbered
marketable securities with a fair value of
approximately $594 billion and $649 billion.
The Firm also had available borrowing capacity
at the Federal Home Loan Banks (“FHLBs”) and the
discount window at the Federal Reserve Banks as
a result of collateral pledged by the Firm to
such banks of approximately $413 billion and
$340 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023,
respectively. This borrowing capacity excludes
the benefit of cash and securities reported in
the Firm’s eligible HQLA or other unencumbered
securities that are currently pledged at the
Federal Reserve Banks discount window and other
central banks. Available borrowing capacity
increased from December 31, 2023 primarily due
to a higher amount of commercial loans and
credit card receivables pledged at the Federal
Reserve Banks. Although available, the Firm does
not view this borrowing capacity at the Federal
Reserve Banks discount window and the other
central banks as a primary source of liquidity.
 NSFR 
The net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”) is a
liquidity requirement for large banking
organizations that is intended to measure the
adequacy of “available” stable funding that is
sufficient to meet their “required” amounts of
stable funding over a one-year horizon.
For the three months ended December 31, 2024,
both the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. were
compliant with the 100% minimum NSFR
requirement, based on the Firm’s interpretation
of the final NSFR rule. Refer to the Firm's U.S.
NSFR Disclosure report on the Firm’s website for
additional information.

 Funding 
 Sources of funds 
Management believes that the Firm’s unsecured
and secured funding capacity is sufficient to
meet its on- and off-balance sheet obligations,
which includes both short- and long-term cash
requirements.
The Firm funds its global balance sheet through
diverse sources of funding including deposits,
secured and unsecured funding in the capital
markets and stockholders’ equity. Deposits are
the primary funding source for JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A. Additionally, JPMorgan Chase Bank,
N.A. may access funding through short- or long-
term secured borrowings, the issuance of
unsecured long-term debt, or from
borrowings from the IHC. The Firm’s non-bank
subsidiaries are primarily funded from long-term
unsecured borrowings and short-term secured
borrowings which are primarily securities loaned
or sold under repurchase agreements. Excess
funding is invested by Treasury and CIO in the
Firm’s investment securities portfolio or
deployed in cash or other short-term liquid
investments based on their interest rate and
liquidity risk characteristics.
Refer to Note 28 for additional information on
off–balance sheet obligations.

(a) In the fourth quarter of 2023, CCB
transferred certain deposits associated with
First Republic to AWM and CIB.
The Firm believes that deposits provide a stable
source of funding and reduce the Firm’s reliance
on the wholesale funding markets. A significant
portion of the Firm’s deposits are consumer
deposits and wholesale operating deposits, which
are both considered to be stable sources of
liquidity. Wholesale operating deposits are
generally considered to be stable sources of
liquidity because they are generated from
customers that maintain operating service
relationships with the Firm.
The Firm believes that average deposit balances
are generally more representative of deposit
trends than period-end deposit balances.
However, during periods of market disruption,
average deposit trends may be impacted.
The following discussion excludes the impact of
the transfer of certain First Republic deposits
in the fourth quarter of 2023 from CCB to the
other LOBs as the transfers had no net impact on
Firmwide deposits.
Average deposits increased for the year ended
December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended
December 31, 2023, reflecting:
• an increase in CIB due to net inflows
predominantly in Payments and net issuances of
structured notes as a result of client demand in
Markets, partially offset by deposit attrition,
which included actions taken to reduce certain
deposits,
• the timing impact of First Republic,
• an increase in AWM as a result of growth in
balances in new and existing client accounts,
reflecting the impact of higher-yielding product
offerings, largely offset by continued migration
into other investments, and
• a decline in CCB primarily driven by a
decrease in balances in existing accounts due to
increased customer spending, largely offset by
new accounts.
Period-end deposits increased from December 31,
2023, reflecting:
• an increase in CIB due to net inflows
predominantly in Payments, largely offset by net
maturities of structured notes in Markets,
• an increase in AWM as a result of growth in
balances in new and existing client accounts,
reflecting the impact of higher-yielding product
offerings, largely offset by continued migration
into other investments, and
• a decline in CCB primarily driven by a
decrease in balances in existing accounts due to
increased customer spending and migration into
higher-yielding investments, predominantly
offset by new accounts.

on pages 54–58 and Note 34 for additional
information on the First Republic acquisition.
Refer to Note 3 for further information on
structured notes. Certain deposits are covered
by insurance protection that provides additional
funding stability and results in a benefit to
the LCR. Deposit insurance protection may be
available to depositors in the countries in
which the deposits are placed. For example, the
FDIC provides deposit insurance protection for
deposits placed in a U.S. depository
institution. At December 31, 2024 and 2023 (a) ,
the Firmwide estimated uninsured deposits were
$1,414.0 billion and $1,347.8 billion,
respectively, primarily reflecting wholesale
operating deposits.
Total uninsured deposits include time deposits.
The table below presents an estimate of
uninsured U.S. and non-U.S. time deposits, and
their remaining maturities. The Firm’s estimates
of its uninsured U.S. time deposits are based on
data that the Firm calculates periodically under
applicable FDIC regulations. For purposes of
this presentation, all non-U.S. time deposits
are deemed to be uninsured.

 Short-term funding 
The Firm’s primary source of short-term secured
funding is securities sold under agreements to
repurchase. These instruments are secured
predominantly by high-quality securities
collateral, including government-issued debt and
U.S. GSE and government agency MBS. Securities
sold under agreements to repurchase increased at
December 31, 2024, compared with December 31,
2023, driven by Markets, reflecting higher
client-driven market-making activities and
higher secured financing of trading assets.
The increase in secured other borrowed funds at
December 31, 2024 from December 31, 2023, as
well as the increase for the average year ended
December 31, 2024, compared to the prior year
period, were both due to higher financing
requirements in Markets, partially offset by
FHLB maturities in Treasury and CIO.
The balances associated with securities loaned
or sold under agreements to repurchase fluctuate
over time due to investment and financing
activities of clients,
the Firm’s demand for financing, the ongoing
management of the mix of the Firm’s liabilities,
including its secured and unsecured financing
(for both the investment securities and market-
making portfolios), and other market and
portfolio factors.
The Firm’s primary sources of short-term
unsecured funding consist of issuances of
wholesale commercial paper and other borrowed
funds.
The decrease in average commercial paper for the
year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the
prior year period was due to lower issuances
primarily as a result of short-term liquidity
management.
The increase in unsecured other borrowed funds
at December 31, 2024 from December 31, 2023, was
predominantly driven by net issuances of
structured notes in Markets.
 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K 113 
 Management’s discussion and analysis 
 Long-term funding 
Long-term funding provides an additional source of stable funding and liquidity for the Firm. The
Firm’s long-term funding plan is driven primarily by expected client activity, liquidity
considerations and regulatory requirements, including TLAC. Long-term funding objectives include
maintaining diversification, maximizing market access and optimizing funding costs. The Firm
evaluates various funding markets, tenors and currencies in creating its optimal long-term funding
plan.
Unsecured funding and issuance
The significant majority of the Firm’s total outstanding long-term debt has been issued by the Parent
Company to provide flexibility in support of the funding needs of both bank and non-bank
subsidiaries. The Parent Company advances substantially all net funding proceeds to its subsidiary,
the IHC. The IHC does not issue debt to external counterparties. The increase in structured notes at
December 31, 2024 from December 31, 2023, and for the average year ended December 31, 2024, compared
to the prior year period, was primarily driven by net issuances of structured notes in Markets due to
client demand.
The following table summarizes long-term unsecured issuance and maturities or redemptions for the
years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. Refer to Note 20 for additional information on the IHC and
long-term debt.

 Credit ratings 
The cost and availability of financing are
influenced by credit ratings. Reductions in
these ratings could have an adverse effect on
the Firm’s access to liquidity sources, increase
the cost of funds, trigger additional collateral
or funding requirements and decrease the number
of investors and counterparties willing to lend
to the Firm. The nature and magnitude of the
impact of ratings downgrades depends on numerous
contractual and behavioral factors, which the
Firm
believes are incorporated in its liquidity risk
and stress testing metrics. The Firm believes
that it maintains sufficient liquidity to
withstand a potential decrease in funding
capacity due to ratings downgrades.
Additionally, the Firm’s funding requirements
for VIEs and other third-party commitments may
be adversely affected by a decline in credit
ratings. Refer to Notes 5 and 14 for additional
information.

JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the other
subsidiaries listed above; (ii) revised its
outlook for the Parent Company, J.P. Morgan
Securities LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities plc
from stable to positive; (iii) revised its
outlook for JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. from
negative to developing, reflecting its view with
respect to possible support from the U.S.
government; and (iv) assessed its outlook for
J.P. Morgan SE as negative with an “(m)”
modifier, reflecting a negative outlook for
long-term bank deposits and a positive outlook
for the long-term issuer rating.
(b) The credit ratings of the Parent Company,
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the other
subsidiaries presented in the table reflect
ratings upgrades by Standard & Poor’s on
November 15, 2024. Standard & Poor’s also
revised its outlook for the Parent Company and
such subsidiaries from positive to stable.
JPMorganChase’s unsecured debt does not contain
requirements that would call for an acceleration
of payments, maturities or changes in the
structure of the existing debt, provide any
limitations on future borrowings or require
additional collateral, based on unfavorable
changes in the Firm’s credit ratings, financial
ratios, earnings, or stock price.
Critical factors in maintaining high credit
ratings include a stable and diverse earnings
stream, strong capital and liquidity ratios,
strong credit quality and risk management
controls, and diverse funding sources. Rating
agencies continue to evaluate economic and
geopolitical trends, regulatory developments,
future profitability, risk management practices,
and litigation matters, as well as their broader
ratings methodologies. Changes in any of these
factors could lead to changes in the Firm’s
credit ratings.

 REPUTATION RISK MANAGEMENT 
Reputation risk is the risk that an action or
inaction may negatively impact perception of the
Firm’s integrity and reduce confidence in the
Firm’s competence by various stakeholders,
including clients, counterparties, customers,
communities, investors, regulators, or
employees.
The types of events that may result in
reputation risk are wide-ranging and can be
introduced by the Firm’s employees, business
strategies and activities, clients, customers
and counterparties with which the Firm does
business. These events could contribute to
financial losses, litigation, regulatory
enforcement actions, fines, penalties or other
sanctions, as well as other harm to the Firm.
 Organization and management 
Reputation Risk Management is an independent
risk management function that establishes the
governance framework for managing reputation
risk across the Firm’s LOBs and Corporate.
Reputation risk is inherently challenging to
identify, manage, and quantify.
The Firm’s reputation risk management function
includes the following activities:
• Maintaining a Firmwide Reputation Risk
Governance policy and a standard consistent with
the reputation risk framework
• Providing oversight of the governance
framework through processes and infrastructure
to support consistent identification, escalation
and monitoring of reputation risk issues
Firmwide
 Governance and oversight 
The Reputation Risk Governance policy
establishes the principles for managing
reputation risk for the Firm. It is the
responsibility of each LOB and Corporate, and
the Firm’s employees, to consider the reputation
of the Firm when deciding whether to offer a new
product, engage in a transaction or client
relationship, enter a new jurisdiction, initiate
a business process or consider any other
activity. Environmental impacts and social
concerns are important considerations in
assessing the Firm’s reputation risk, and are a
component of the Firm’s reputation risk
governance.

 CREDIT AND INVESTMENT RISK MANAGEMENT 
Credit and investment risk is the risk
associated with the default or change in credit
profile of a client, counterparty or customer;
or loss of principal or a reduction in expected
returns on investments, including consumer
credit risk, wholesale credit risk, and
investment portfolio risk.
 Credit risk management 
Credit risk is the risk associated with the
default or change in credit profile of a client,
counterparty or customer. The Firm provides
credit to a variety of clients and customers,
ranging from large corporate and institutional
clients to individual consumers and small
businesses. In its consumer businesses, the Firm
is exposed to credit risk primarily through its
home lending, credit card, auto, and business
banking businesses. In its wholesale businesses,
the Firm is exposed to credit risk through its
underwriting, lending, market-making, and
hedging activities with and for clients and
counterparties, as well as through its operating
services activities (such as cash management and
clearing activities), and securities financing
activities. The Firm is also exposed to credit
risk through its investment securities portfolio
and cash placed with banks.
Credit Risk Management monitors and measures
credit risk throughout the Firm, and defines
credit risk policies, procedures and limits. The
Firm’s credit risk management governance
includes the following activities:
• Maintaining a credit risk policy framework
• Monitoring and measuring credit risk across
all portfolio segments, including transaction
and exposure approval
• Setting industry and geographic concentration
limits, as appropriate, and setting guidelines
for credit review and analysis
• Assigning and maintaining credit approval
authorities in connection with the approval of
credit exposure
• Monitoring and independent assessment of
criticized exposures and delinquent loans, and
• Estimating credit losses and supporting
appropriate credit risk-based capital management
 Risk identification and measurement 
To measure credit risk, the Firm employs several
methodologies for estimating the likelihood of
obligor or counterparty default. Methodologies
for measuring credit risk vary depending on
several factors, including type of asset (e.g.,
consumer versus wholesale), risk measurement
parameters (e.g., delinquency status and
borrower’s credit score versus wholesale risk-
rating) and risk management and collection
processes (e.g., retail collection center versus
centrally managed workout groups). Credit risk
measurement is based on the probability of
default of an obligor or counterparty, the loss
severity given a default event and the exposure
at default.
Based on these factors and the methodology and
estimates described in Note 13 and Note 10, the
Firm estimates credit losses for its exposures.
The allowance for loan losses reflects estimated
credit losses related to the consumer and
wholesale held-for-investment loan portfolios,
the allowance for lending-related commitments
reflects estimated credit losses related to the
Firm’s lending-related commitments and the
allowance for investment securities reflects
estimated credit losses related to the
investment securities portfolio. Refer to Note
13, Note 10 and Critical Accounting Estimates
used by the Firm on pages 161–164 for further
information.
In addition, potential and unexpected credit
losses are reflected in the allocation of credit
risk capital and represent the potential
volatility of actual losses relative to the
established allowances for loan losses and
lending-related commitments. The analyses for
these losses include stress testing that
considers alternative economic scenarios as
described below.
 Stress testing 
Stress testing is important in measuring and
managing credit risk in the Firm’s credit
portfolio. The stress testing process assesses
the potential impact of alternative economic and
business scenarios on estimated credit losses
for the Firm. Economic scenarios and the
underlying parameters are defined centrally,
articulated in terms of macroeconomic factors
and applied across the businesses. The stress
test results may indicate credit migration,
changes in delinquency trends and potential
losses in the credit portfolio. In addition to
the periodic stress testing processes,
management also considers additional stresses
outside these scenarios, including industry and
country- specific stress scenarios, as
appropriate. The Firm uses stress testing to
inform decisions on setting risk appetite both
at a Firm and LOB level, as well as to assess
the impact of stress on individual
counterparties.

 Management’s discussion and analysis 
 Risk monitoring and management 
The Firm has developed policies and practices
that are designed to preserve the independence
and integrity of the approval and decision-
making process for extending credit so that
credit risks are assessed accurately, approved
properly, monitored regularly and managed
actively at both the transaction and portfolio
levels. The policy framework establishes credit
approval authorities, concentration limits,
risk-rating methodologies, portfolio review
parameters and guidelines for management of
distressed exposures. In addition, certain
models, assumptions and inputs used in
evaluating and monitoring credit risk are
independently validated by groups that are
separate from the LOBs.
Consumer credit risk is monitored for
delinquency and other trends, including any
concentrations at the portfolio level, as
certain of these trends can be addressed through
changes in underwriting policies and portfolio
guidelines. Consumer Risk Management evaluates
delinquency and other trends against business
expectations, current and forecasted economic
conditions, and industry benchmarks. Historical
and forecasted economic performance and trends
are incorporated into the modeling of estimated
consumer credit losses and are part of the
monitoring of the credit risk profile of the
portfolio.
Wholesale credit risk is monitored regularly at
an aggregate portfolio, industry, and individual
client and counterparty level with established
concentration limits that are reviewed and
revised periodically as deemed appropriate by
management. Industry and counterparty limits, as
measured in terms of exposure and economic risk
appetite, are subject to stress-based loss
constraints.
Management of the Firm’s wholesale credit risk
exposure is accomplished through a number of
means, including:
• Loan underwriting and credit approval
processes
• Loan syndications and participations
• Loan sales and securitizations
• Credit derivatives
• Master netting agreements, and
• Collateral and other risk-reduction techniques
In addition to Credit Risk Management, an
independent Credit Review function is
responsible for:
• I ndependently assessing risk grades assigned
to exposures in the Firm’s wholesale credit
portfolio and the timeliness of risk grade
changes initiated by responsible business units;
and
• Evaluating the effectiveness of the credit
management processes of the LOBs and Corporate,
including the adequacy of credit analyses and
risk grading/loss given default (“LGD”)
rationales, proper monitoring and management of
credit exposures, and compliance with applicable
grading policies and underwriting guidelines.
Refer to Note 12 for further discussion of
consumer and wholesale loans.
 Risk reporting 
To enable monitoring of credit risk and
effective decision-making, aggregate credit
exposure, credit quality forecasts,
concentration levels and risk profile changes
are reported regularly to senior members of
Credit Risk Management. Detailed portfolio
reporting of industry, clients, counterparties
and customers, product and geography are
prepared, and the appropriateness of the
allowance for credit losses is reviewed by
senior management at least on a quarterly basis.
Through the risk reporting and governance
structure, credit risk trends and limit
exceptions are provided regularly to, and
discussed with, risk committees, senior
management and the Board of Directors.

Portfolio analysis Loans decreased from December
31, 2023 driven by residential real estate loans
and scored auto loans. The following discussions
provide information concerning individual loan
products. Refer to Note 12 for further
information about this portfolio, including
information about delinquencies, loan
modifications and other credit quality
indicators. Residential real estate: The
residential real estate portfolio, including
loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value,
predominantly consists of prime mortgage loans
and home equity lines of credit. Retained loans
decreased compared to December 31, 2023,
predominantly driven by paydowns and loan sales,
net of originations. Retained nonaccrual loans
decreased compared to December 31, 2023,
predominantly driven by loan sales. Net
recoveries were higher for the year ended
December 31, 2024 compared to the prior year,
driven by loan sales. Loans held-for-sale and
nonaccrual loans held-for-sale increased from
December 31, 2023, predominantly driven by
transfers of certain retained loans in
anticipation of securitization and loan sales,
respectively. Loans at fair value increased from
December 31, 2023, predominantly driven by
higher Home Lending loans, as originations
outpaced warehouse loan sales. Nonaccrual loans
at fair value increased compared to December 31,
2023, driven by CIB. At December 31, 2024 and
2023, the carrying values of retained interest-
only residential mortgage loans were $88.9
billion and $90.6 billion, respectively. These
loans have an interest-only payment period
generally followed by an adjustable-rate or
fixed-rate fully amortizing payment period to
maturity and are typically originated as higher-
balance loans to higher-income borrowers. The
credit performance of this portfolio is
comparable to the performance of the broader
prime mortgage portfolio. The carrying value of
retained home equity lines of credit outstanding
was $14.5 billion at December 31, 2024,
including $3.8 billion of HELOCs that have
recast from interest-only to fully amortizing
payments or have been modified, and $3.6 billion
of interest-only balloon HELOCs, which primarily
mature after 2030. The Firm manages the risk of
HELOCs during their revolving period by reducing
or canceling the undrawn line in accordance with
the contract or to the extent otherwise
permitted by law, including when there has been
a demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness
of the borrower or significant decrease in the
value of the underlying property.
The following table provides a summary of the
Firm’s residential mortgage portfolio insured
and/or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies,
predominantly loans held-for-sale and loans at
fair value. The Firm monitors its exposure to
certain potential unrecoverable claim payments
related to government-insured loans and
considers this exposure in estimating the
allowance for loan losses.

Auto and other : The auto and other loan
portfolio, including loans at fair value,
generally consists of prime-quality scored auto
and business banking loans, other consumer
unsecured loans, and overdrafts. The portfolio
decreased when compared to December 31, 2023,
predominantly due to loan securitizations. Net
charge-offs increased compared to the prior
year, predominantly due to net charge-offs of
scored auto loans of $445 million compared to

 Credit card 
Total credit card loans increased from December
31, 2023 reflecting growth from new accounts and
revolving balances. The December 31, 2024 30+
and 90+ day delinquency rates of 2.17% and
1.14%, respectively, increased compared to the
December 31, 2023 30+ and 90+ day delinquency
rates of 2.14% and 1.05%, respectively, in line
with the Firm’s expectations. Net charge-offs
increased for the year ended December 31, 2024
compared to the prior year reflecting the
seasoning of vintages originated in recent
years, credit normalization and balance growth.
Consistent with the Firm’s policy, all credit
card loans typically remain on accrual status
until charged off. However, the Firm’s allowance
for loan losses includes the estimated
uncollectible portion of accrued and billed
interest and fee income.
Geographic and FICO composition of credit card
loans
At December 31, 2024, $109.0 billion, or 47% of
the total retained credit card loan portfolio,
was concentrated in California, Texas, New York,
Florida and Illinois, compared to $98.1 billion,
or 46%, at December 31, 2023.
Refer to Note 12 for further information about

 Management’s discussion and analysis 
 WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO 
In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk primarily through its underwriting,
lending, market-making, and hedging activities with and for clients and counterparties, as well as
through various operating services (such as cash management and clearing activities), securities
financing activities and cash placed with banks. A portion of the loans originated or acquired by the
Firm’s wholesale businesses is generally retained on the balance sheet. The Firm distributes a
significant percentage of the loans that it originates into the market as part of its syndicated loan
business and to manage portfolio concentrations and credit risk. The wholesale portfolio is actively
managed, in part by conducting ongoing, in-depth reviews of client credit quality and transaction
structure, inclusive of collateral where applicable, and of industry, product and client
concentrations. Refer to the industry discussion on pages 128–131 for further information. The Firm’s
wholesale credit portfolio includes exposure held in CIB, AWM and Corporate, and risk-rated exposure
held in CCB, for which the wholesale methodology is applied when determining the allowance for loan
losses. As of December 31, 2024, loans increased $19.8 billion, driven by higher loans in CIB and
higher securities-based lending in AWM. Lending-related commitments decreased $5.3 billion, with
decreases in AWM and CCB, largely offset by higher commitments in CIB. As of December 31, 2024,
nonperforming exposure increased by $2.3 billion, predominantly driven by Real Estate, concentrated
in Office, Healthcare and Consumer & Retail, in each case resulting from downgrades. For the year
ended December 31, 2024, wholesale net charge-offs were $822 million, largely driven by Real Estate,
concentrated in Office, and client-specific charge-offs across multiple industries including Consumer
& Retail and Individuals.

(a) Loans held-for-sale are primarily related to syndicated loans and loans transferred from the
retained portfolio.
(b) These derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP.
(c) The notional amounts are presented on a net basis by underlying reference entity and the ratings
profile shown is based on the ratings of the reference entity on which protection has been purchased.
Predominantly all of the credit derivatives entered into by the Firm where it has purchased
protection used in credit portfolio management activities are executed with investment-grade
counterparties. In addition, the Firm obtains credit protection against certain loans in the retained
loan portfolio through the issuance of credit-related notes.
(d) The maturity profile of retained loans, lending-related commitments and derivative receivables is
generally based on remaining contractual maturity. Derivative contracts that are in a receivable
position at December 31, 2024, may become payable prior to maturity based on their cash flow profile
or changes in market conditions.

 Management’s discussion and analysis 
 Wholesale credit exposure – industry exposures 
The Firm focuses on the management and diversification of its industry exposures, and pays particular
attention to industries with actual or potential credit concerns.
Exposures that are deemed to be criticized align with the U.S. banking regulators’ definition of
criticized exposures, which consist of the special mention, substandard and doubtful categories.
Total criticized exposure, excluding loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value, was $44.7 billion
and $41.4 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, representing approximately 3.5% and 3.3% of total
wholesale credit exposure, respectively; of the $44.7 billion, $39.9 billion was performing. The
increase in criticized exposure was driven by Real Estate resulting from downgrades, primarily in
Multifamily and Office, and new commitments in Technology and Media, partially offset by Consumer &
Retail resulting from net portfolio activity and upgrades.
The table below summarizes by industry the Firm’s exposures as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. The
industry of risk category is generally based on the client or counterparty’s primary business
activity. Refer to Note 4 for additional information on industry concentrations.

Loans In its wholesale businesses, the Firm
provides loans to a variety of clients, ranging
from large corporate and institutional clients
to high-net-worth individuals. Refer to Note 12
for a further discussion on loans, including
information about delinquencies, loan
modifications and other credit quality
indicators. The following table presents the
change in the nonaccrual loan portfolio for the
years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. Since
December 31, 2023, nonaccrual loan exposure
increased by $2.2 billion, predominantly driven
by Real Estate, concentrated in Office,
Healthcare and Consumer & Retail, in each case
resulting from downgrades.

 Management’s discussion and analysis 
 Lending-related commitments 
The Firm uses lending-related financial
instruments, such as commitments (including
revolving credit facilities) and guarantees, to
address the financing needs of its clients. The
contractual amounts of these financial
instruments represent the maximum possible
credit risk should the clients draw down on
these commitments or when the Firm fulfills its
obligations under these guarantees, and the
clients subsequently fail to perform according
to the terms of these contracts. Most of these
commitments and guarantees have historically
been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired
without being drawn upon or a default occurring.
As a result, the Firm does not believe that the
total contractual amount of these wholesale
lending-related commitments is representative of
the Firm’s expected future credit exposure or
funding requirements. Refer to Note 28 for
further information on wholesale lending-related
commitments.
 Receivables from customers 
Receivables from customers reflect held-for-
investment margin loans to brokerage clients in
CIB, CCB and AWM that are collateralized by
assets maintained in the clients’ brokerage
accounts (including cash on deposit, and
primarily liquid and readily marketable debt or
equity securities). To manage its credit risk,
the Firm establishes margin requirements and
monitors the required margin levels on an
ongoing basis, and requires clients to deposit
additional cash or other collateral, or to
reduce positions, when appropriate. Credit risk
arising from lending activities subject to
collateral maintenance requirements is generally
mitigated by factors such as the short-term
nature of the activity, the fair value of
collateral held and the Firm’s right to call
for, and the borrower’s obligation to provide,
additional margin when the fair value of the
collateral declines. Because of these mitigating
factors, these receivables generally do not
require an allowance for credit losses. However,
if in management’s judgment, an allowance for
credit losses is required, the Firm estimates
expected credit losses based on the value of the
collateral and probability of borrower default.
These receivables are reported within accrued
interest and accounts receivable on the Firm’s
Consolidated balance sheets.
Refer to Note 13 for further information on the
Firm’s accounting policies for the allowance for
credit losses.
 Derivative contracts 
Derivatives enable clients and counterparties to
manage risk, including credit risk and risks
arising from fluctuations in interest rates,
foreign exchange and equities and commodities
prices. The Firm makes markets in derivatives in
order to meet these needs and uses derivatives
to manage certain risks associated with net open
risk positions from its market-making
activities, including the counterparty credit
risk arising from derivative receivables. The
Firm also uses derivative instruments to manage
its own credit risk and other market risk
exposure. The nature of the counterparty and the
settlement mechanism of the
derivative affect the credit risk to which the
Firm is exposed. For over-the-counter (“OTC”)
derivatives, the Firm is exposed to the credit
risk of the derivative counterparty. For
exchange-traded derivatives (“ETD”), such as
futures and options, and cleared over-the-
counter (“OTC-cleared”) derivatives, the Firm
can also be exposed to the credit risk of the
relevant CCP. Where possible, the Firm seeks to
mitigate its credit risk exposures arising from
derivative contracts through the use of legally
enforceable master netting arrangements and
collateral agreements. The percentage of the
Firm’s OTC derivative transactions subject to
collateral agreements — excluding foreign
exchange spot trades, which are not typically
covered by collateral agreements due to their
short maturity and centrally cleared trades that
are settled daily — was approximately 86% and
87% at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Refer to Note 5 for additional information on
the Firm’s use of collateral agreements and for
a further discussion of derivative contracts,
counterparties and settlement types.
The fair value of derivative receivables
reported on the Consolidated balance sheets was
$61.0 billion and $54.9 billion at December 31,
2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was
primarily as a result of market movements.
Derivative receivables represent the fair value
of the derivative contracts after giving effect
to legally enforceable master netting agreements
and the related cash collateral held by the
Firm.
In addition, the Firm holds liquid securities
and other cash collateral that may be used as
security when the fair value of the client’s
exposure is in the Firm’s favor. For these
purposes, the definition of liquid securities is
consistent with the definition of high quality
liquid assets as defined in the LCR rule.
In management’s view, the appropriate measure of
current credit risk should also take into
consideration other collateral, which generally
represents securities that do not qualify as
high quality liquid assets under the LCR rule.
The benefits of these additional collateral
amounts for each counterparty are subject to a
legally enforceable master netting agreement and
limited to the net amount of the derivative
receivables for each counterparty.
The Firm also holds additional collateral
(primarily cash, G7 government securities, other
liquid government agency and guaranteed
securities, and corporate debt and equity
securities) delivered by clients at the
initiation of transactions, as well as
collateral related to contracts that have a non-
daily call frequency and collateral that the
Firm has agreed to return but has not yet
settled as of the reporting date. Although this
collateral does not reduce the receivables
balances and is not included in the tables
below, it is available as security against
potential exposure that could arise should the
fair value of the client’s derivative contracts
move in the Firm’s favor. Refer to Note 5 for
additional information on the Firm’s use of
collateral agreements for derivative
transactions.

While useful as a current view of credit
exposure, the net fair value of the derivative
receivables does not capture the potential
future variability of that credit exposure. To
capture this variability, the Firm calculates,
on a client-by-client basis, three measures of
potential derivatives-related credit loss: Peak,
Derivative Risk Equivalent (“DRE”), and Average
exposure (“AVG”). These measures all incorporate
netting and collateral benefits, where
applicable.
Peak represents a conservative measure of
potential derivative exposure, including the
benefit of collateral, to a counterparty
calculated in a manner that is broadly
equivalent to a 97.5% confidence level over the
life of the transaction. Peak is the primary
measure used by the Firm for setting credit
limits for derivative contracts, senior
management reporting and derivatives exposure
management.
DRE exposure is a measure that expresses the
risk of derivative exposure, including the
benefit of collateral, on a basis intended to be
equivalent to the risk of loan exposures. DRE is
a less extreme measure of potential credit loss
than Peak.
Finally, AVG is a measure of the expected fair
value of the Firm’s derivative exposures,
including the benefit of collateral, at future
time periods. AVG over the total life of the
derivative contract is used as the primary
metric for pricing purposes and is used to
calculate credit risk capital and CVA, as
further described below.
The fair value of the Firm’s derivative
receivables incorporates CVA to reflect the
credit quality of counterparties. CVA is based
on the Firm’s AVG to a counterparty and the
counterparty’s credit spread in the credit
derivatives market. The Firm believes that
active risk management is essential to
controlling the dynamic credit risk in the
derivatives portfolio. In addition, the Firm’s
risk management process for derivatives
exposures takes into consideration the potential
impact of wrong-way risk, which is broadly
defined as the risk that exposure to a
counterparty is positively correlated with the
impact of a default by the same counterparty,
which could cause exposure to increase at the
same time as the counterparty’s capacity to meet
its obligations is decreasing. Many factors may
influence the nature and magnitude of these
correlations over time. To the extent that these
correlations are identified, the Firm may adjust
the CVA associated with a particular
counterparty’s AVG. The Firm risk manages
exposure to changes in CVA by entering into
credit derivative contracts, as well as interest
rate, foreign exchange, equity and commodity
derivative contracts.
The below graph shows exposure profiles to the
Firm’s current derivatives portfolio over the
next 10 years as calculated by the Peak, DRE and
AVG metrics. The three measures generally show
that exposure will decline after the first year,
if no new trades are added to the portfolio.

 Management’s discussion and analysis 
Credit derivatives The Firm uses credit derivatives for two primary purposes: first, in its capacity
as a market-maker, and second, as an end-user to manage the Firm’s own credit risk associated with
various exposures. Credit portfolio management activities Included in the Firm’s end-user activities
are credit derivatives used to mitigate the credit risk associated with traditional lending
activities (loans and lending-related commitments) and derivatives counterparty exposure in the
Firm’s wholesale businesses (collectively, “credit portfolio management activities”). Information on
credit portfolio management activities is provided in the table below. The Firm also uses credit
derivatives as an end-user to manage other exposures, including credit risk arising from certain
securities held in the Firm’s market-making businesses. These credit derivatives are not included in
credit portfolio management activities.

(a) Amounts are presented net, considering the
Firm’s net protection purchased or sold with
respect to each underlying reference entity or
index. The credit derivatives used in credit
portfolio management activities do not qualify
for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP; these
derivatives are reported at fair value, with
gains and losses recognized in principal
transactions revenue. In contrast, the loans and
lending-related commitments being risk-managed
are accounted for on an accrual basis. This
asymmetry in accounting treatment, between loans
and lending-related commitments and the credit
derivatives used in credit portfolio management
activities, causes earnings volatility that is
not representative, in the Firm’s view, of the
true changes in value of the Firm’s overall
credit exposure. The effectiveness of credit
default swaps (“CDS”) as a hedge against the
Firm’s exposures may vary depending on a number
of factors, including the named reference entity
(i.e., the Firm may experience losses on
specific exposures that are different than the
named reference entities in the purchased CDS);
the contractual terms of the CDS (which may have
a defined credit event that does not align with
an actual loss realized by the Firm); and the
maturity of the Firm’s CDS protection (which in
some cases may be shorter than the Firm’s
exposures). However, the Firm generally seeks to
purchase credit protection with a maturity date
that is the same or similar to the maturity date
of the exposure for which the protection was
purchased, and remaining differences in maturity
are actively monitored and managed by the Firm.
Refer to Credit derivatives in Note 5 for
further information on credit derivatives and
derivatives used in credit portfolio management
activities.

 ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES 
The Firm’s allowance for credit losses
represents management's estimate of expected
credit losses over the remaining expected life
of the Firm's financial assets measured at
amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet
lending-related commitments. The Firm's
allowance for credit losses generally consists
of: • the allowance for loan losses, which
covers the Firm’s retained loan portfolios
(scored and risk-rated) and is presented
separately on the Consolidated balance sheets, •
the allowance for lending-related commitments,
which is reflected in accounts payable and other
liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets,
and • the allowance for credit losses on
investment securities, which is reflected in
investment securities on the Consolidated
balance sheets. Discussion of changes in the
allowance The allowance for credit losses as of
December 31, 2024 was $26.9 billion, reflecting
a net addition of $2.1 billion from December 31,
2023. The net addition to the allowance for
credit losses included: • $2.1 billion in
consumer , reflecting: – a $2.2 billion net
addition in Card Services, predominantly driven
by loan growth, reflecting higher revolving
balances, including the seasoning of vintages
originated in recent years, partially offset by
– a $125 million net reduction in Home Lending
in the first quarter of 2024, and • a net
reduction of $30 million in wholesale ,
reflecting: – changes in certain macroeconomic
variables, an update to loss assumptions on
certain loans in Markets, and a reduction due to
charge-offs largely from collateral-dependent
loans, predominantly offset by – net downgrade
activity, primarily in Real Estate, and the
impact of incorporating the First Republic
portfolio into the Firm’s modeled credit loss
estimates in the second quarter of 2024. The
Firm’s qualitative adjustments continued to
include additional weight placed on the adverse
scenarios to reflect ongoing uncertainties and
downside risks related to the geopolitical and
macroeconomic environment. The Firm's allowance
for credit losses is estimated using a weighted
average of five internally developed
macroeconomic scenarios. The adverse scenarios
incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors
than the central case assumptions provided in
the table below, resulting in:
• a weighted average U.S. unemployment rate
peaking at 5.5% in the fourth quarter of 2025,
and • a weighted average U.S. real GDP level
that is 1.9% lower than the central case at the
end of the second quarter of 2026. The following
table presents the Firm’s central case
assumptions for the periods presented:

periods. Refer to Consumer Credit Portfolio on
pages 120–125, Wholesale Credit Portfolio on
pages 126–136 and Note 12 for additional
information on the consumer and wholesale credit
portfolios. Refer to Critical Accounting

 Management’s discussion and analysis 
 INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO RISK MANAGEMENT 
Investment portfolio risk is the risk associated
with the loss of principal or a reduction in
expected returns on investments arising from the
investment securities portfolio or from
principal investments. The investment securities
portfolio is predominantly held by Treasury and
CIO in connection with the Firm's balance sheet
and asset-liability management objectives.
Principal investments are predominantly
privately-held financial instruments and are
managed in the LOBs and Corporate. Investments
are typically intended to be held over extended
periods and, accordingly, the Firm has no
expectation for short-term realized gains with
respect to these investments. Investment
securities risk Investment securities risk
includes the exposure associated with a default
in the payment of principal and interest. This
risk is mitigated given that the investment
securities portfolio held by Treasury and CIO
predominantly consists of high-quality
securities. At December 31, 2024, the Treasury
and CIO investment securities portfolio, net of
the allowance for credit losses, was $678.3
billion, and the average credit rating of the
securities comprising the portfolio was AA+
(based upon external ratings where available,
and where not available, based primarily upon
internal risk ratings). Refer to Corporate
results on pages 88–90 and Note 10 for further
information on the investment securities
portfolio and internal risk ratings. Refer to
Liquidity Risk Management on pages 108–115 for
further information on related liquidity risk.
Refer to Market Risk Management on pages 141–149
for further information on the market risk
inherent in the portfolio. Governance and
oversight Investment securities risks are
governed by the Firm’s Risk Appetite framework,
and reviewed at the CTC Risk Committee with
regular updates provided to the Board Risk
Committee. The Firm’s independent control
functions are responsible for reviewing the
appropriateness of the carrying value of
investment securities in accordance with
relevant policies. Approved levels for
investment securities are established for each
risk category, including capital and credit
risks.
Principal investment risk Principal investments
are typically privately-held financial
instruments representing ownership interests or
other forms of junior capital. In general,
principal investments include tax-oriented
investments and investments made to enhance or
accelerate the Firm’s business strategies and
exclude those that are consolidated on the
Firm's balance sheets. These investments are
made by dedicated investing businesses or as
part of a broader business strategy. The Firm’s
principal investments are managed by the LOBs
and Corporate and are reflected within their
respective financial results. The Firm’s
investments will continue to evolve based on
market circumstances and in line with its
strategic initiatives. The table below presents
the aggregate carrying values of the principal
investment portfolios as of December 31, 2024

and oversight The Firm’s approach to managing
principal investment risk is consistent with the
Firm’s risk governance structure. The Firm has
established a Firmwide risk policy framework for
all principal investing activities that includes
approval by executives who are independent from
the investing businesses, as appropriate. The
Firm’s independent control functions are
responsible for reviewing the appropriateness of
the carrying value of investments in accordance
with relevant policies. As part of the risk
governance structure, approved levels for
investments are established and monitored for
each relevant business or segment in order to
manage the overall size of the portfolios. The
Firm also conducts stress testing on these
portfolios using specific scenarios that
estimate losses based on significant market
moves and/or other risk events.

 MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT 
Market risk is the risk associated with the
effect of changes in market factors such as
interest and foreign exchange rates, equity and
commodity prices, credit spreads or implied
volatilities, on the value of assets and
liabilities held for both the short and long
term.
 Market Risk Management 
Market Risk Management monitors market risks
throughout the Firm and defines market risk
policies and procedures.
Market Risk Management seeks to facilitate
efficient risk/return decisions, reduce
volatility in operating performance and provide
transparency into the Firm’s market risk profile
for senior management, the Board of Directors
and regulators. Market Risk Management is
responsible for the following functions:
• Maintaining a market risk policy framework
• Independently measuring and monitoring LOB,
Corporate, and Firmwide market risk
• Defining, approving and monitoring limits
• Performing stress testing and qualitative risk
assessments
 Risk measurement 
 Measures used to capture market risk 
There is no single measure to capture market
risk and therefore Market Risk Management uses
various metrics, both statistical and
nonstatistical, to assess risk including:
• Value-at-risk
• Stress testing
• Profit and loss drawdowns
• Earnings-at-risk
• Economic Value Sensitivity
• Other sensitivity-based measures
 Risk monitoring and control 
Market risk exposure is managed primarily
through a series of limits set in the context of
the market environment and business strategy. In
setting limits, Market Risk Management takes
into consideration factors such as market
volatility, product liquidity, accommodation of
client business, and management judgment. Market
Risk Management maintains different levels of
limits. Firm level limits include VaR and stress
limits. Similarly, LOB and Corporate limits
include VaR and stress limits and may be
supplemented by certain nonstatistical risk
measures such as profit and loss drawdowns.
Limits may also be set within the LOBs and
Corporate, as well as at the legal entity level.
Market Risk Management sets limits and regularly
reviews and updates them as appropriate. Senior
management is responsible for reviewing and
approving certain of these risk limits on an
ongoing basis. Limits that have not been
reviewed within specified time periods by Market
Risk Management are reported to senior
management. The LOBs and Corporate are
responsible for adhering to established limits
against which exposures are monitored and
reported.
Limit breaches are required to be reported in a
timely manner to limit approvers, which include
Market Risk Management and senior management. In
the event of a breach, Market Risk Management
consults with senior members of appropriate
groups within the Firm to determine the suitable
course of action required to return the
applicable positions to compliance, which may
include a reduction in risk in order to remedy
the breach or granting a temporary increase in
limits to accommodate an expected increase in
client activity and/or market volatility. Firm,
Corporate or LOB-level limit breaches are
escalated as appropriate.
Models used to measure market risk are
inherently imprecise and are limited in their
ability to measure certain risks or to predict
losses. This imprecision may be heightened when
sudden or severe shifts in market conditions
occur. For additional discussion on model
uncertainty refer to Estimations and Model Risk
Management on page 160.
Market Risk Management periodically reviews the
Firm’s existing market risk measures to identify
opportunities for enhancement, and to the extent
appropriate, will calibrate those measures
accordingly over time.

 Management’s discussion and analysis 
The following table summarizes the predominant business activities and related market risks, as well
as positions which give rise to market risk and certain measures used to capture those risks, for
each LOB and Corporate.
In addition to the predominant business activities, each LOB and Corporate may engage in principal
investing activities. To the extent principal investments are deemed market risk sensitive, they are
reflected in relevant risk measures and captured in the table below. Refer to Investment Portfolio
Risk Management on page 140 for additional discussion on principal investments.

 142 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K 
 Value-at-risk 
JPMorganChase utilizes value-at-risk (“VaR”), a
statistical risk measure, to estimate the
potential loss from adverse market moves in the
current market environment. The Firm has a
single VaR framework used as a basis for
calculating Risk Management VaR and Regulatory
VaR.
The framework is employed across the Firm using
historical simulation based on data for the
previous 12 months. The framework’s approach
assumes that historical changes in market values
are representative of the distribution of
potential outcomes in the immediate future. The
Firm believes the use of Risk Management VaR
provides a daily measure of risk that is closely
aligned to risk management decisions made by the
LOBs and Corporate and, along with other market
risk measures, provides the appropriate
information needed to respond to risk events.
The Firm’s Risk Management VaR is calculated
assuming a one-day holding period and an
expected tail-loss methodology which
approximates a 95% confidence level. Risk
Management VaR provides a consistent framework
to measure risk profiles and levels of
diversification across product types and is used
for aggregating risks and monitoring limits
across businesses. VaR results are reported as
appropriate to various groups including senior
management, the Board Risk Committee and
regulators.
Underlying the overall VaR model framework are
individual VaR models that simulate historical
market returns for individual risk factors
and/or product types. To capture material market
risks as part of the Firm’s risk management
framework, comprehensive VaR model calculations
are performed daily for businesses whose
activities give rise to market risk. These VaR
models are granular and incorporate numerous
risk factors and inputs to simulate daily
changes in market values over the historical
period; inputs are selected based on the risk
profile of each portfolio, as sensitivities and
historical time series used to generate daily
market values may be different across product
types or risk management systems. The VaR model
results across all portfolios are aggregated at
the Firm level.
As VaR is based on historical data, it is an
imperfect measure of market risk exposure and
potential future losses. In addition, based on
their reliance on available historical data,
limited time horizons, and other factors, VaR
measures are inherently limited in their ability
to measure certain risks and to predict losses,
particularly those associated with market
illiquidity and sudden or severe shifts in
market conditions.
For certain products, specific risk parameters
are not captured in VaR due to the lack of
liquidity and availability of appropriate
historical data. The Firm uses proxies to
estimate the VaR for these and other products
when daily time series are not available. It is
likely that using an actual price-based time
series for these products, if available, would
affect the VaR results presented. The Firm
therefore considers other nonstatistical
measures such as stress testing, in addition to
VaR, to capture and manage its market risk
positions.
As VaR model calculations require daily data and
a consistent source for valuation, the daily
market data used may be different than the
independent third-party data collected for VCG
price testing in its monthly valuation process.
For example, in cases where market prices are
not observable, or where proxies are used in VaR
historical time series, the data sources may
differ. Refer to Valuation process in Note 2 for
further information on the Firm’s valuation
process.
The Firm’s VaR model calculations are
periodically evaluated and enhanced in response
to changes in the composition of the Firm’s
portfolios, changes in market conditions,
improvements in the Firm’s modeling techniques
and measurements, and other factors. Such
changes may affect historical comparisons of VaR
results. Refer to Estimations and Model Risk
Management on page 160 for information regarding
model reviews and approvals.
The Firm calculates separately a daily
aggregated VaR in accordance with regulatory
rules (“Regulatory VaR”), which is used to
derive the Firm’s regulatory VaR-based capital
requirements under Basel III capital rules. This
Regulatory VaR model framework currently assumes
a ten business-day holding period and an
expected tail-loss methodology which
approximates a 99% confidence level. Regulatory
VaR is applied to “covered” positions as defined
by Basel III capital rules, which may be
different than the positions included in the
Firm’s Risk Management VaR. For example, credit
derivative hedges of accrual loans are included
in the Firm’s Risk Management VaR, while
Regulatory VaR excludes these credit derivative
hedges. In addition, in contrast to the Firm’s
Risk Management VaR, Regulatory VaR currently
excludes the diversification benefit for certain
VaR models.
Refer to JPMorganChase’s Basel III Pillar 3
Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which
are available on the Firm’s website, for
additional information on Regulatory VaR and the
other components of market risk regulatory
capital for the Firm (e.g., VaR-based measure,
stressed VaR-based measure and the respective
backtesting).

(a) The impact of the business segment reorganization in the second quarter of 2024 was not material
to Total CIB VaR. Prior periods have not been revised. Refer to Business Segment & Corporate Results
on pages 70–90 for additional information.
(b) Diversification benefit represents the difference between the portfolio VaR and the sum of its
individual components. This reflects the non-additive nature of VaR due to imperfect correlation
across LOBs, Corporate, and risk types. For maximum and minimum VaR, diversification benefit is not
meaningful as the maximum and minimum VaR for each portfolio may have occurred on different trading
days than the components.
(c) Includes the derivative CVA, hedges of the CVA and credit protection purchased against certain
retained loans and lending-related commitments, which are reported in principal transactions revenue.
This VaR does not include the retained loan portfolio, which is not reported at fair value. In line
with the Firm's internal model governance, the credit risk component of CVA related to certain
counterparties was removed from Credit Portfolio VaR due to the widening of the credit spreads for
those counterparties to elevated levels. The related hedges were also removed to maintain
consistency. This exposure is now reflected in other sensitivity-based measures.
(d) In the second quarter of 2024, the presentation of Corporate and other LOB VaR was updated to
disaggregate AWM VaR due to the increase associated with credit protection purchased against certain
retained loans and lending-related commitments. The VaR does not include the retained loan portfolio,
which is not reported at fair value.
(e) Includes a legacy private equity position which is publicly traded, as well as Visa C shares
which the Firm disposed of in the second and third quarters of 2024. The impact of Visa C shares
resulted in elevated average and maximum Corporate VaR, Other VaR and Total VaR. Refer to Executive
Overview on pages 54–58 for additional information.
 2024 compared with 2023 
Average Total VaR increased by $4 million for
the year ended December 31, 2024 when compared
with the prior year. The increase was
predominantly driven by the impact of the Firm’s
receipt of Visa C shares on Corporate VaR and
increases associated with credit
protection purchased against certain retained
loans and lending-related commitments within
Credit Portfolio VaR and AWM VaR, largely offset
by market volatility rolling out of the one-year
historical look-back period impacting the Fixed
income risk type.
The following graph presents daily Risk
Management VaR for the four trailing quarters.
The increase in VaR and subsequent decline
observed in the second quarter of 2024 was
primarily driven by changes in Visa C share
exposure in the Firm's Corporate VaR.

 VaR backtesting 
The Firm performs daily VaR model backtesting,
which compares the daily Risk Management VaR
results with the daily gains and losses that are
utilized for VaR backtesting purposes. The gains
and losses depicted in the chart below do not
reflect the Firm’s reported revenue as they
exclude certain components of total net revenue,
such as those associated with the execution of
new transactions (i.e., intraday client-driven
trading and intraday risk management
activities), fees, commissions, other valuation
adjustments and net interest income. These
excluded components of total net revenue may
more than offset the backtesting gain or loss on
a particular day. The definition of backtesting
gains and losses above is consistent with the
requirements for backtesting under Basel III
capital rules.
A backtesting exception occurs when the daily
backtesting loss exceeds the daily Risk
Management VaR for the prior day. Under the
Firm’s Risk Management VaR methodology, assuming
current changes in market values are consistent
with the historical changes used in the
simulation, the Firm would expect to incur VaR
backtesting exceptions five times every 100
trading days on average. The number of VaR
backtesting exceptions observed can differ from
the statistically expected number of backtesting
exceptions if the current level of market
volatility is materially different from the
level of market volatility during the 12 months
of historical data used in the VaR calculation.
For the 12 months ended December 31, 2024, the
Firm posted backtesting gains on 179 of the 260
days, and observed eight VaR backtesting
exceptions, of which three were in the three
months ended December 31, 2024. Firmwide
backtesting loss days can differ from the loss
days for which Fixed Income Markets and Equity
Markets posted losses, as disclosed in CIB
Markets revenue, as the population of positions
which comprise each metric are different and due
to the exclusion of certain components of total
net revenue in backtesting gains and losses as
described above.
The following chart presents the distribution of
Firmwide daily backtesting gains and losses for
the trailing 12 months and three months ended
December 31, 2024. The daily backtesting losses
are displayed as a percentage of the
corresponding daily Risk Management VaR. The
count of days with backtesting losses are shown
in aggregate, in fifty percentage point
intervals. Backtesting exceptions are displayed
within the intervals that are greater than one
hundred percent. The results in the chart below
differ from the results of backtesting disclosed
in the Market Risk section of the Firm’ s B asel

reports, which are based on Regulatory VaR
applied to the Firm’s covered positions.

 Management’s discussion and analysis 
 Other risk measures 
 Stress testing 
Along with VaR, stress testing is an important
tool used to assess risk. While VaR reflects the
risk of loss due to adverse changes in markets
using recent historical market behavior, stress
testing reflects the risk of loss from
hypothetical changes in the value of market risk
sensitive positions applied simultaneously.
Stress testing measures the Firm’s vulnerability
to losses under a range of stressed but possible
economic and market scenarios. The results are
used to understand the exposures responsible for
those potential losses and are measured against
limits.
The Firm’s stress framework covers market risk
sensitive positions in the LOBs and Corporate.
The framework is used to calculate multiple
magnitudes of potential stress for both market
rallies and market sell-offs, assuming
significant changes in market factors such as
credit spreads, equity prices, interest rates,
currency rates and commodity prices, and
combines them in multiple ways to capture an
array of hypothetical economic and market
scenarios.
The Firm generates a number of scenarios that
focus on tail events in specific asset classes
and geographies, including how the event may
impact multiple market factors simultaneously.
Scenarios also incorporate specific
idiosyncratic risks and stress basis risk
between different products. The flexibility in
the stress framework allows the Firm to
construct new scenarios that can test the
outcomes against possible future stress events.
Stress testing results are reported periodically
to senior management of the Firm, as
appropriate.
Stress methodologies are governed by the overall
stress framework, under the oversight of Market
Risk Management. The Firmwide Market Risk Stress
Methodology Committee reviews and approves
changes to stress testing methodology and
scenarios across the Firm. Significant changes
to the framework are escalated to senior
management, as appropriate. In addition, stress
methodology and the models to calculate the
stress results are subject to the Firm’s
Estimations and Model Risk Management Policy
The Firm’s stress testing framework is utilized
in calculating the Firm’s CCAR and other stress
test results, which are reported periodically to
the Board of Directors. In addition, stress
testing results are incorporated into the Firm’s
Risk Appetite framework, and are reported
periodically to the Board Risk Committee.
 Profit and loss drawdowns 
Profit and loss drawdowns are used to highlight
trading losses above certain levels of risk
tolerance. A profit and loss drawdown is a
decline in revenue from its year-to-date peak
level.
 Structural interest rate risk management 
The effect of interest rate exposure on the
Firm’s reported net income is important as
interest rate risk represents one of the Firm’s
significant market risks. Interest rate risk
arises not only from trading activities which
are included in VaR, but also from the Firm’s
traditional banking activities, which include
extension of loans and credit facilities, taking
deposits, issuing debt, as well as the
investment securities portfolio, and associated
derivative instruments. Refer to the table on
page 142 for a summary by LOB and Corporate
identifying positions included in earnings-at-
risk.
 Governance 
The CTC Risk Committee establishes the Firm’s
interest rate risk management policy and related
limits, which are subject to approval by the
Board Risk Committee. Treasury and CIO, working
in partnership with the LOBs, calculates the
Firm’s structural interest rate risk profile and
reviews it with senior management, including the
CTC Risk Committee. In addition, oversight of
structural interest rate risk is managed through
a dedicated risk function reporting to the CTC
CRO. This risk function is responsible for
providing independent oversight and governance
around assumptions and establishing and
monitoring limits for structural interest rate
risk, including limits related to Earnings-at-
Risk and Economic Value Sensitivity. The Firm
manages structural interest rate risk generally
through its investment securities portfolio and
interest rate derivatives.
 Key risk drivers and risk management process 
Structural interest rate risk can arise due to a
variety of factors, including:
• Differences in timing among the maturity or
repricing of assets, liabilities and off-balance
sheet instruments
• Differences in the amounts of assets,
liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments
that are maturing or repricing at the same time
• Differences in the amounts by which short-term
and long-term market interest rates change (for
example, changes in the slope of the yield
curve)
• The impact of changes in the maturity of
various assets, liabilities or off-balance sheet
instruments as interest rates change
The Firm manages interest rate exposure related
to its assets and liabilities on a consolidated,
Firmwide basis. Business units transfer their
interest rate risk to Treasury and CIO through
funds transfer pricing, which takes into account
the elements of interest rate exposure that can
be risk-managed in financial markets. These
elements include asset and liability balances
and contractual rates of interest, contractual
principal payment schedules, expected prepayment
 146 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K 
experience, interest rate reset dates and
maturities, rate indices used for repricing, and
any interest rate ceilings or floors for
adjustable rate products.
 Earnings-at-Risk 
One way that the Firm evaluates its structural
interest rate risk is through earnings-at-risk.
Earnings-at-risk estimates the Firm’s interest
rate exposure for a given interest rate
scenario. It is presented as a sensitivity to a
baseline, which includes net interest income and
certain interest rate sensitive fees. The
baseline uses market interest rates and, in the
case of deposits, pricing assumptions. The Firm
conducts simulations of changes to this baseline
for interest rate-sensitive assets and
liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars and
other currencies (“non-U.S. dollar” currencies).
These simulations primarily include retained and
held-for-sale loans, deposits, deposits with
banks and financing activities, investment
securities, long-term debt, related interest
rate hedges, and funds transfer pricing of other
positions in risk management VaR and other
sensitivity-based measures as described on page
142. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2024,
these simulations also include hedges of
non-U.S. dollar foreign exchange exposures
arising from capital investments. Refer to
non-U.S. dollar foreign exchange risk on page
149 for more informa tion.
Earnings-at-risk scenarios estimate the
potential change to a baseline over the
following 12 months utilizing multiple
assumptions. These scenarios include a parallel
shift involving changes to both short-term and
long-term rates by an equal amount; a steeper
yield curve involving holding short-term rates
constant and increasing long-term rates; and a
flatter yield curve involving increasing short-
term rates and holding long-term rates constant
or holding short-term rates constant and
decreasing long-term rates. These scenarios
consider many different factors, including:
• The impact on exposures as a result of
instantaneous changes in interest rates from
baseline rates.
• Forecasted balance sheet, as well as modeled
prepayment and reinvestment behavior, but
excluding assumptions about actions that could
be taken by the Firm or its clients and
customers in response to instantaneous rate
changes. Mortgage prepayment assumptions are
based on the interest rates used in the
scenarios compared with underlying contractual
rates, the time since origination, and other
factors which are updated periodically based on
historical experience. Deposit forecasts are a
key assumption in the Firm’s earnings-at-risk.
The baseline reflects certain assumptions
relating to the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet
policy (e.g., quantitative tightening and usage
at the Reverse Repurchase Facility) that
require management judgment. The amount of
deposits that the Firm holds at any given time
may be influenced by Federal Reserve actions, as
well as broader monetary conditions and
competition for deposits.
• The pricing sensitivity of deposits, known as
deposit betas, represent the amount by which
deposit rates paid could change upon a given
change in market interest rates. Actual deposit
rates paid may differ from the modeled
assumptions, primarily due to customer behavior
and competition for deposits.
The Firm performs sensitivity analyses of the
assumptions used in earnings-at-risk scenarios,
including with respect to deposit betas and
forecasts of deposit balances, both of which are
especially significant in the case of consumer
deposits. The results of these sensitivity
analyses are reported to the CTC Risk Committee
and the Board Risk Committee.
The Firm’s earnings-at-risk scenarios are
periodically evaluated and enhanced in response
to changes in the composition of the Firm’s
balance sheet, changes in market conditions,
improvements in the Firm’s simulation and other
factors. In the second quarter of 2024, the Firm
updated certain deposit rates paid assumptions
which take into account observed pricing and
client and customer behavior during the most
recent economic cycle. These updated deposit
rates paid assumptions impacted the U.S. dollar
scenarios, resulting in an increase in positive
sensitivity in higher interest rate scenarios,
and an increase in negative sensitivity in lower
interest rate scenarios.
The Firm’s earnings-at-risk sensitivities are
measures of the Firm’s interest rate exposure.
The Firm’s actual net interest income for the
rate changes presented may differ as the
earnings-at-risk scenarios are modelled as
instantaneous changes and exclude any actions
that could be taken by the Firm or its clients
or customers in response to rate changes. Other
significant assumptions in the earnings-at-risk
scenarios, including mortgage prepayments and
deposit rates paid, may also differ from actual
results. The Firm’s forecast for net interest
income is included in the Firm’s outlook on page
57.

(a) Reflects the simultaneous shift of U.S.
dollar and non-U.S. dollar rates, and the
inclusion of the hedges of non-U.S. dollar
capital investments. This inclusion had no
impact on total sensitivities but increased U.S.
dollar and decreased non-U.S. dollar
sensitivities. Subsequent to this change,
non-U.S. dollar sensitivities were
insignificant. (b) At December 31, 2023,
represents the total of the Firm’s U.S. dollar
and non-U.S. dollar sensitivities as previously
reported. The change in the Firm’s sensitivities
as of December 31, 2024, compared to December
31, 2023, were primarily driven by Treasury and
CIO balance sheet actions where the Firm added
duration through investment securities activity,
cash flow hedges of retained loans and fair
value hedges of Firm debt. The impact on the
sensitivities of the Treasury and CIO balance
sheet actions were largely offset by the impact
of deposits, primarily from the second quarter
of 2024 update of the deposit rates paid
assumptions for certain consumer and wholesale
deposit products. Additionally, the results as
of December 31, 2024 reflected the update to
include hedges of the Firm’s non-U.S. dollar
capital investments. Although total results were
not impacted, these hedges increase U.S. dollar
sensitivities and decrease non-U.S. dollar
sensitivities. In the absence of these updates
the Firm’s sensitivities as of December 31,
2024, would have been different by the amounts
reported in the following table:

Economic Value Sensitivity In addition to
earnings-at-risk, which is measured as a
sensitivity to a baseline of earnings over the
next 12 months, the Firm also measures Economic
Value Sensitivity (“EVS”). EVS stress tests the
longer-term economic value of equity by
measuring the sensitivity of the Firm’s current
balance sheet, primarily retained loans,
deposits, debt and investment securities as well
as related hedges, under various interest rate
scenarios. The Firm's pricing and cash flow
assumptions associated with deposits, as well as
prepayment assumptions for loans and securities,
are significant factors in the EVS measure. In
accordance with the CTC interest rate risk
management policy, the Firm has established
limits on EVS as a percentage of TCE. Certain
assumptions used in the EVS measure may differ
from those required in the fair value
measurement note to the Consolidated Financial
Statements. For example, certain assets and
liabilities with no stated maturity, such as
credit card receivables and deposits, have
longer assumed durations in the EVS measure.
Additional information on long-term debt and
held to maturity investment securities is
disclosed on page 201 in Note 2.
 148 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K 
 Non-U.S. dollar foreign exchange risk 
Non-U.S. dollar FX risk is the risk that changes in foreign exchange rates affect the value of the
Firm’s assets or liabilities or future results. The Firm has structural non-U.S. dollar FX exposures
arising from capital investments, forecasted expense and revenue, the investment securities portfolio
and non-U.S. dollar-denominated debt issuance. Treasury and CIO, working in partnership with the
LOBs, primarily manage these risks on behalf of the Firm. Treasury and CIO may hedge certain of these
risks using derivatives. Refer to Business Segment & Corporate Results on page 71 for additional
information.
 Other sensitivity-based measures 
The Firm quantifies the market risk of certain debt and equity and credit and funding-related
exposures by assessing the potential impact on net revenue, other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and
noninterest expense due to changes in relevant market variables. Refer to the predominant business
activities that give rise to market risk on page 142 for additional information on the positions
captured in other sensitivity-based measures.
The table below represents the potential impact to net revenue, OCI or noninterest expense for market
risk sensitive instruments that are not included in VaR or earnings-at-risk. Where appropriate,
instruments used for hedging purposes are reported net of the positions being hedged. The
sensitivities disclosed in the table below may not be representative of the actual gain or loss that
would have been realized at December 31, 2024 and 2023, as the movement in market parameters across
maturities may vary and are not intended to imply management’s expectation of future changes in these
sensitivities.

 Management’s discussion and analysis 
 COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT 
The Firm, through its LOBs and Corporate, may be
exposed to country risk resulting from
financial, economic, political or other
significant developments which adversely affect
the value of the Firm’s exposures related to a
particular country or set of countries. The
Country Risk Management group actively monitors
the various portfolios which may be impacted by
these developments and measures the extent to
which the Firm’s exposures are diversified given
the Firm’s strategy and risk tolerance relative
to a country.
 Organization and management 
Country Risk Management is an independent risk
management function that assesses and monitors
exposure to country risk across the Firm.
The Firm’s country risk management function
includes the following activities:
• Maintaining policies, procedures and standards
consistent with a comprehensive country risk
framework
• Assigning sovereign ratings, assessing country
risks and establishing risk tolerance relative
to a country
• Measuring and monitoring country risk exposure
and stress across the Firm
• Managing and approving country limits and
reporting trends and limit breaches to senior
management
• Developing surveillance tools, such as
signaling models and ratings indicators, for
early identification of potential country risk
concerns
• Providing country risk scenario analysis
 Sources and measurement 
The Firm is exposed to country risk through its
lending and deposits, investing, and market-
making activities, whether cross-border or
locally funded. Country exposure includes
activity with both government and private-sector
entities in a country.
Under the Firm’s internal country risk
management approach, attribution of exposure to
an individual country is based on the country
where the largest proportion of the assets of
the counterparty, issuer, obligor or guarantor
are located or where the largest proportion of
its revenue is derived, which may be different
than the domicile (i.e. legal residence) or
country of incorporation.
Individual country exposures reflect an
aggregation of the Firm’s risk to an immediate
default, with zero recovery, of the
counterparties, issuers, obligors or guarantors
attributed to that country. Activities which
result in contingent or indirect exposure to a
country are not included in the country exposure
measure (for exa mple, providing clearing
services or secondary exposure to collateral on
securities financing receivables).
Assumptions are sometimes required in
determining the measurement and allocation of
country exposure, particularly in the case of
certain non-linear or index products, or where
the nature of the counterparty, issuer, obligor
or guarantor is not suitable for attribution to
an individual country. The use of different
measurement approaches or assumptions could
affect the amount of reported country exposure.
Under the Firm’s internal country risk
measurement framework:
• Deposits with banks are measured as the cash
balances placed with central banks, commercial
banks, and other financial institutions
• Lending exposures are measured at the total
committed amount (funded and unfunded), net of
the allowance for credit losses and eligible
cash and marketable securities collateral
received
• Securities financing exposures are measured at
their receivable balance, net of eligible
collateral received
• Debt and equity securities are measured at the
fair value of all positions, including both long
and short positions
• Counterparty exposure on derivative
receivables is measured at the derivative’s fair
value, net of the fair value of the eligible
collateral received
• Credit derivatives exposure is measured at the
net notional amount of protection purchased or
sold for the same underlying reference entity,
inclusive of the fair value of the derivative
receivable or payable, reflecting the manner in
which the Firm manages these exposures
The Firm’s internal country risk reporting
differs from the reporting provided under the
FFIEC bank regulatory requirements.
 150 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K 
Stress testing Stress testing is an important component of the Firm’s country risk management
framework, which aims to estimate and limit losses arising from a country crisis by measuring the
impact of adverse asset price movements to a country based on market shocks combined with
counterparty specific assumptions. Country Risk Management periodically designs and runs tailored
stress scenarios to test vulnerabilities to individual countries or sets of countries in response to
specific or potential market events, sector performance concerns, sovereign actions and geopolitical
risks. These tailored stress results are used to inform potential risk reduction across the Firm, as
necessary. Risk reporting Country exposure and stress are measured and reported regularly, and used
by Country Risk Management to identify trends and monitor high usages and breaches against limits.
For country risk management purposes, the Firm may report exposure to jurisdictions that are not
fully autonomous, including dependent territories and Special Administrative Regions (“SAR”) such as
Hong Kong SAR, separately from the independent sovereign states with which they are associated. The
following table presents the Firm’s top 20 exposures by country (excluding the U.S.) as of December
31, 2024, and their comparative exposures as of December 31, 2023. The top 20 country exposures
represent the Firm’s largest total exposures by individual country. Country exposures may fluct uate
from period to period due to a variety of factors, including client activity, market flows and
liquidity management activities undertaken by the Firm. The increase in exposure to Germany when
compared to December 31, 2023, was driven by an increase in cash placed with the central bank of
Germany, predominantly due to client-driven market-making activities and higher client deposits. The
increase in exposure to Japan when compared to December 31, 2023, was driven by an increase in cash
placed with the central bank of Japan as a result of client-driven market-making activities. The Firm
continues to monitor its exposure to Russia, which corresponds to cash placed with the central bank,
but which excludes deposits placed on behalf of clients at the Deposit Insurance Agency of Russia.
The Firm currently believes that its remaining exposure to Russia is not material. Refer to Note 30
on pages 310–311 for information concerning Russian litigation.

 Management’s discussion and analysis 
 CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT 
Climate risk refers to the potential threats
posed by climate change to the Firm and its
clients, customers, operations and business
strategy. Climate change is viewed as a driver
of risk that may impact existing types of risks
managed by the Firm. Climate risk is categorized
into physical risk and transition risk.
Physical risk involves economic costs and
financial losses due to a changing climate.
Acute physical risk drivers include the
increased frequency or severity of climate and
weather events, such as floods, wildfires and
tropical cyclones. Chronic physical risk drivers
include more gradual shifts in the climate, such
as sea level rise, persistent changes in
precipitation levels and increases in average
ambient temperatures.
Transition risk involves the financial and
economic consequences of society’s shift toward
a lower-carbon economy. Transition risk drivers
include possible changes in public policy,
adoption of new technologies and shifts in
consumer preferences. Transition risks may also
be influenced by changes in the physical
climate.
 Organization and management 
The Firm has a Climate Risk Management function
that is responsible for establishing and
maintaining the Firmwide framework and strategy
for managing climate risks that may impact the
Firm.
Other responsibilities of Climate Risk
Management include:
• Setting policies, standards, procedures and
processes to support identification, escalation,
monitoring and management of climate risk across
the Firm
• Developing metrics, scenarios and stress
testing mechanisms designed to assess the range
of potential climate-related financial and
economic impacts to the Firm
• Establishing a Firmwide climate risk data
strategy and the supporting climate risk
technology infrastructure
The LOBs and Corporate are responsible for the
identification, assessment and management of
climate risks present in their business
activities and for the adherence to applicable
climate-related laws, rules and regulations.
 Governance and oversight 
The Firm’s framework and strategy for managing
climate risk is integrated into the Firm’s risk
governance structure. This framework allows for
the escalation of significant climate risk-
related issues to LOB Risk Committees. The Board
Risk Committee also receives information on
significant climate risks and climate-related
initiatives, as appropriate.
 152 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K 
 OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT 
Operational risk is the risk of an adverse
outcome resulting from inadequate or failed
internal processes or systems; human factors; or
external events impacting the Firm’s processes
or systems. Operational Risk includes
compliance, conduct, legal, and estimations and
model risk. Operational risk is inherent in the
Firm’s activities and can manifest itself in
various ways, including fraudulent acts,
business disruptions (including those caused by
extraordinary events beyond the Firm's control),
cyber attacks, inappropriate employee behavior,
failure to comply with applicable laws, rules
and regulations or failure of vendors or other
third party providers to perform in accordance
with their agreements. Operational Risk
Management attempts to manage operational risk
at appropriate levels in light of the Firm’s
financial position, the characteristics of its
businesses, and the markets and regulatory
environments in which it operates.
 Operational Risk Management Framework 
The Firm’s Compliance, Conduct, and Operational
Risk (“CCOR”) Management Framework is designed
to enable the Firm to govern, identify, measure,
monitor and test, manage and report on the
Firm’s operational risk.
Operational Risk Governance
The LOBs and Corporate are responsible for the
management of operational risk. The Control
Management Organization, which consists of
control managers within each LOB and Corporate,
is responsible for the day-to-day execution of
the CCOR Framework.
The Firm’s Global Chief Compliance Officer
(“CCO”) and FRE for Operational Risk and
Qualitative Risk Appetite is responsible for
defining the CCOR Management Framework and
establishing the minimum standards for its
execution. The LOB and Corporate aligned CCOR
Lead Officers report to the Global CCO and FRE
for Operational Risk and Qualitative Risk
Appetite and are independent of the respective
businesses or functions they oversee. The CCOR
Management Framework is included in the Risk
Governance and Oversight Policy that is reviewed
and approved by the Board Risk Committee
periodically.
Operational Risk Identification
The Firm utilizes a structured risk and control
self-assessment process that is executed by the
LOBs and Corporate. As part of this process, the
LOBs and Corporate evaluate the effectiveness of
their respective control environment to assess
circumstances in which controls have failed, and
to determine where remediation efforts may be
required. The Firm’s Operational Risk and
Compliance organization (“Operational Risk and
Compliance”)
provides oversight of and challenge to these
evaluations and may also perform independent
assessments of significant operational risk
events and areas of concentrated or emerging
risk.
Operational Risk Measurement
Operational Risk and Compliance performs an
independent assessment of the operational risks
inherent within the LOBs and Corporate, which
includes evaluating the effectiveness of the
control environments and reporting the results
to senior management.
In addition, Operational Risk and Compliance
assesses operational risks through quantitative
means, including operational risk-based capital
and estimation of operational risk losses under
both baseline and stressed conditions.
The primary component of the operational risk-
based capital estimate is the Loss Distribution
Approach (“LDA”) statistical model, which
simulates the projected frequency and severity
of operational risk losses based on historical
data. The LDA model is used to estimate an
aggregate operational risk loss over a one-year
time horizon, at a 99.9% confidence level. The
LDA model incorporates actual internal
operational risk losses in the quarter following
the period in which those losses were realized,
and the calculation generally continues to
reflect such losses even after the issues or
business activities giving rise to the losses
have been remediated or reduced.
As required under the Basel III capital
framework, the Firm’s operational risk capital
methodology, which uses the Advanced Measurement
Approach (“AMA”), incorporates internal and
external losses as well as management’s view of
tail risk captured through operational risk
scenario analysis, and evaluation of key
business environment and internal control
metrics. The Firm does not reflect the impact of
insurance in its AMA estimate of operational
risk capital.
The Firm considers the impact of stressed
economic conditions on operational risk losses
and develops a forward looking view of material
operational risk events that may occur in a
stressed environment. The Firm’s operational
risk stress testing framework is utilized in
calculating results for the Firm’s CCAR and
other stress testing processes.
Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 97–107
for information related to operational risk RWA,
and CCAR.
Operational Risk Monitoring and Testing
The results of risk assessments performed by
Operational Risk and Compliance are used in
connection with their independent monitoring and
testing compliance of the LOBs and Corporate
with
 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K 153 
 Management’s discussion and analysis 
laws, rules and regulations. Through monitoring
and testing, Operational Risk and Compliance
independently identify areas of heightened
operational risk and tests the effectiveness of
controls within the LOBs and Corporate.
Management of Operational Risk
The operational risk areas or issues identified
through monitoring and testing are escalated to
the LOBs and Corporate to be remediated through
action plans, as needed, to mitigate operational
risk. Operational Risk and Compliance may advise
the LOBs and Corporate in the development and
implementation of action plans.
Operational Risk Reporting
All employees of the Firm are expected to
escalate risks appropriately. Risks identified
by Operational Risk and Compliance are escalated
to the appropriate LOB and Corporate Control
Committees, as needed. Operational Risk and
Compliance has established standards designed to
ensure that consistent operational risk
reporting and operational risk reports are
produced on a Firmwide basis as well as by the
LOBs and Corporate. Reporting includes the
evaluation of key risk and performance
indicators against established thresholds as
well as the assessment of different types of
operational risk against stated risk appetite.
The standards establish escalation protocols to
senior management and to the Board of Directors.
 Insurance 
One of the ways in which operational risk may be
mitigated is through insurance maintained by the
Firm. The Firm purchases insurance from
commercial insurers and maintains a wholly-owned
captive insurer, Park Assurance Company.
Insurance may also be required by third parties
with whom the Firm does business.
 Subcategories and examples of operational risks 
Operational risk can manifest itself in various
ways. Operational risk subcategories include
Compliance risk, Conduct risk, Legal risk, and
Estimations and Model risk. Refer to pages 157,
158, 159 and 160, respectively for more
information on Compliance, Conduct, Legal, and
Estimations and Model risk. Details on other
select examples of operational risks such as
business and technology resiliency, payment
fraud and third-party outsourcing, as well as
cybersecurity, are provided below.
Firmwide resiliency risk
Disruptions of the Firm’s business and
operations can occur due to forces beyond the
Firm’s control such as the spread of infectious
diseases or pandemics, severe weather, natural
disasters, the effects of climate change, power
or telecommunications loss, failure of a third
party to provide expected services,
cyberattacks, civil or political unrest or
terrorism. The Firm’s resiliency framework is
intended to enable the Firm to prepare for and
adapt to changing conditions and withstand and
recover from, and address adverse effects on its
operations caused by, disruptions that may
impact critical business functions and
supporting assets, including its staff,
technology, data and facilities, as well as
those of third-party service providers. The
framework includes governance, awareness
training, planning and testing of recovery
strategies, as well as strategic and tactical
initiatives to identify, assess, and manage
resiliency risks. The framework operates in
accordance with the Firm’s overall approach to
Operational Risk Management, including alignment
with technology, cybersecurity, data, physical
security, crisis management, real estate and
outsourcing programs.
Payment fraud risk
Payment fraud risk is the risk of external and
internal parties unlawfully obtaining personal
monetary benefit through misdirected or
otherwise improper payment. The Firm employs
various controls for managing payment fraud risk
as well as providing employee and client
education and awareness trainings.
Third-party outsourcing risk
The Firm‘s Third-Party Oversight (“TPO”) and
Inter-affiliates Oversight (“IAO”) frameworks
assist the LOBs and Corporate in selecting,
documenting, onboarding, monitoring and managing
their supplier relationships including services
provided by affiliates. The objectives of the
TPO framework are to hold suppliers and other
third parties to an appropriate standard of
operational performance and to mitigate key
risks, including data loss and business
disruptions. The Corporate Third-Party Oversight
group is responsible for Firmwide training,
monitoring, reporting and standards with respect
to third-party outsourcing risks.
 154 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K 
Cybersecurity risk
Cybersecurity risk is the risk of harm or loss
resulting from misuse or abuse of technology or
the unauthorized disclosure of data.
 Overview 
Cybersecurity risk is an important and
continuously evolving focus for the Firm.
Significant resources are devoted to protecting
and enhancing the security of computer systems,
software, networks, storage devices, and other
technology. The Firm’s security efforts are
designed to protect against, among other things,
cybersecurity attacks that can result in
unauthorized access to confidential information,
the destruction of data, disruptions to or
degradations of service, the sabotaging of
systems or other damage. The Firm has
experienced, and expects that it will continue
to experience, a higher volume and complexity of
cyber attacks against the backdrop of heightened
geopolitical tensions. The Firm has implemented
measures and controls reasonably designed to
address this evolving environment, including
enhanced threat monitoring. In addition, the
Firm continues to review and enhance its
capabilities to address associated risks, such
as those relating to the management of
administrative access to systems. Third parties
with which the Firm does business, that
facilitate the Firm’s business activities (e.g.,
vendors, supply chain, exchanges, clearing
houses, central depositories, and financial
intermediaries) or that the Firm has acquired
are also sources of cybersecurity risk to the
Firm. Third party incidents such as system
breakdowns or failures, misconduct by the
employees of such parties, or cyber attacks,
including ransomware and supply-chain
compromises, could have a material adverse
effect on the Firm, including in circumstances
in which an affected third party is unable to
deliver a product or service to the Firm or
where the incident delivers compromised software
to the Firm or results in lost or compromised
information of the Firm or its clients or
customers. Clients and customers are also
sources of cybersecurity risk to the Firm and
its information assets, particularly when their
activities and systems are beyond the Firm’s own
security and control systems. The Firm engages
in periodic discussions with its clients,
customers and other external parties concerning
cybersecurity risks including opportunities to
improve cybersecurity. Risks from cybersecurity
threats, including any previous cybersecurity
events, have not materially affected the Firm or
its business strategy, results of operations or
financial condition.Notwithstanding the
comprehensive approach that the Firm takes to
address cybersecurity risk, the Firm may not be
successful in preventing or mitigating a future
cybersecurity incident that could have a
material adverse effect on the Firm or its
business strategy, results of operations or
financial condition.
 Organization and management 
The Global Chief Information Security Officer
(“CISO”)reports to the Global Chief Information
Officer, and is a member of key cybersecurity
governance forums. The CISO leads the Global
Cybersecurity and Technology Controls
organization, which is responsible for
identifying technology and cybersecurity risks
and for implementing and maintaining controls to
manage cybersecurity threats. The CISO and the
members of senior management within Global
Technology and the Cybersecurity and Technology
Controls organizations all have relevant
expertise and experience in cybersecurity and
information technology risk management,
including relevant experience at the Firm, at
other financial services companies or in other
highly-regulated industries.
The CISO is responsible for the Firm’s
Information Security Program, which is designed
to prevent, detect and respond to cyber attacks
in order to help safeguard the confidentiality,
integrity and availability of the Firm's
infrastructure, resources and information. The
program includes managing the Firm’s global
cybersecurity operations centers, providing
training, conducting cybersecurity event
simulation exercises, implementing the Firm’s
policies and standards relating to technology
risk and cybersecurity management, and
enhancing, as needed, the Firm’s cybersecurity
capabilities.
The Firm’s Information Security Program includes
the following functions:
Cyber Operations , which is responsible for
implementing and maintaining controls designed
to detect and defend the Firm against cyber
attacks, and includes a dedicated function for
incident response and ongoing monitoring for
cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities,
including those among the Firm’s third-party
suppliers.
Technology Governance, Risk & Controls , which
is responsible for operationalizing technology
risk and control frameworks, analyzing
regulatory developments that may impact the
Firm, and developing control catalogs and
assessments of controls, as well as overseeing
governance and reporting of technology and
cybersecurity risk.
Security Awareness , which provides awareness
and training that reinforces information risk
and security management practices and compliance
with the Firm's policies, standards and
practices. The training is mandatory for all
employees globally on a periodic basis, and it
is supplemented by Firmwide testing initiatives,
including periodic phishing tests. The Firm also
provides specialized security training to
 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K 155 
 Management’s discussion and analysis 
employees in specific roles, such as application
developers. The Firm’s Global Privacy Program
requires all employees to take periodic training
on data privacy that focuses on confidentiality
and security, as well as responding to
unauthorized access to or use of information.
Technology Resiliency , which establishes
control requirements for planning and testing
the prioritized recovery of technology services
in the event of degradation or outage, including
incident response planning, data backup and
retention, and recovery readiness in support of
the Firmwide Business Resiliency Program and
operational risk management practices.
The Firm has a cybersecurity incident response
plan designed to enable the Firm to respond to
attempted cybersecurity incidents, coordinate as
appropriate with law enforcement and other
government agencies, notify clients and
customers, as applicable, and recover from such
incidents. In addition, the Firm actively
partners with appropriate government and law
enforcement agencies and peer industry forums,
participating in discussions and simulations to
assist in understanding the full spectrum of
cybersecurity risks and in enhancing defenses
and improving resiliency in the Firm’s operating
environment.
 Governance and oversight 
The governance structure for the Global
Cybersecurity and Technology Controls
organization is designed to appropriately
identify, escalate and mitigate cybersecurity
risks. Cybersecurity risk management and its
governance and oversight are integrated into the
Firm’s operational risk management framework,
including through the escalation of key risk and
control issues to management and the development
of risk mitigation plans for heightened risk and
control issues.IRM independently assesses and
challenges the activities and risk management
practices of the Global Cybersecurity and
Technology Controls organization related to the
identification, assessment, measurement and
mitigation of cybersecurity risk. As needed, the
Firm engages third-party assessors or auditing
firms with industry-recognized expertise on
cybersecurity matters to review specific aspects
of the Firm’s cybersecurity risk management
framework, processes and controls.
The governance and oversight for cybersecurity
risk management includes governance forums that
inform management of key areas of concern
regarding the prevention, detection, mitigation
and remediation of cybersecurity risks.
The Cybersecurity and Technology Controls
Operating Committee (“CTOC”) is the principal
management committee that oversees the Firm’s
assessment and management of cybersecurity risk,
including oversight of the implementation and
maintenance of appropriate controls in support
of the Firm’s Information Security Program.The
membership of the CTOC includes senior
representatives from the Global Cybersecurity
and Technology Controls organization and
relevant corporate functions, including IRM and
Internal Audit. The CTOC escalates key
operational risk and control issues, as
appropriate, to the Global Technology Operating
Committee (“GTOC”) or its business control
committee or to the appropriate LOB and
Corporate Control Committees. The GTOC is
responsible for the governance of the Firmwide
Global Technology organization, including
oversight of Firmwide technology strategies, the
delivery of technology and technology
operations, the effective use of information
technology resources, and monitoring and
resolving key operational risk and control
matters arising in the Global Technology
organization. As part of its oversight of
management’s implementation and maintenance of
the Firm’s risk management framework, the Firm’s
Board of Directors receives periodic updates
from the CIO, the CISO and senior members of the
CTOC concerning cybersecurity matters.These
updates generally include information regarding
cybersecurity and technology developments, the
Firm’s Information Security Program and
recommended changes to that program,
cybersecurity policies and practices, and
ongoing initiatives to improve information
security, as well as any significant
cybersecurity incidents and the Firm's efforts
to address those incidents.The Audit Committee
and the Risk Committee assist the Board in this
oversight.

 COMPLIANCE RISK MANAGEMENT 
Compliance risk, a subcategory of operational
risk, is the risk of failing to comply with
laws, rules, regulations or codes of conduct and
standards of self-regulatory organizations.
 Overview 
Each of the LOBs and Corporate hold primary
ownership of and accountability for managing
their compliance risk. The Firm’s Operational
Risk and Compliance Organization (“Operational
Risk and Compliance”), which is independent of
the LOBs and Corporate, provides independent
review, monitoring and oversight of business
operations with a focus on compliance with the
laws, rules, and regulations applicable to the
delivery of the Firm’s products and services to
clients and customers.
These compliance risks relate to a wide variety
of laws, rules and regulations across the LOBs
and Corporate, and jurisdictions, and include
risks related to financial products and
services, relationships and interactions with
clients and customers, and employee activities.
For example, compliance risks include those
associated with anti-money laundering
compliance, trading activities, market conduct,
and complying with the laws, rules, and
regulations related to the offering of products
and services across jurisdictional borders.
Compliance risk is also inherent in the Firm’s
fiduciary activities, including the failure to
exercise the applicable standard of care to act
in the best interest of fiduciary clients and
customers or to treat fiduciary clients and
customers fairly.
Other functions provide oversight of significant
regulatory obligations that are specific to
their respective areas of responsibility.
Operational Risk and Compliance implements
policies and standards designed to govern,
identify, measure, monitor and test, manage, and
report on compliance risk.
 Governance and oversight 
Operational Risk and Compliance is led by the
Firm’s Global CCO and FRE for Operational Risk
and Qualitative Risk Appetite.
The Firm maintains oversight and coordination of
its compliance risk through the CCOR Management
Framework. The Firm’s Global CCO and FRE for
Operational Risk and Qualitative Risk Appetite
also provides regular updates to the Board Risk
Committee and the Audit Committee on significant
compliance risk issues, as appropriate.
Code of Conduct
The Firm has a Code of Conduct (the “Code”) that
sets forth the Firm’s expectation that employees
will conduct themselves with integrity, at all
times. The Code provides the principles that
help govern employee conduct with clients,
customers, suppliers, vendors, shareholders,
regulators, other employees, as well as with the
markets and communities in which the Firm
operates. The Code requires employees to
promptly report any potential or actual
violation of the Code, Firm policies, or laws,
rules or regulations applicable to the Firm’s
business. It also requires employees to report
any illegal or unethical conduct, or conduct
that violates the underlying principles of the
Code, by any of the Firm’s employees,
consultants, clients, customers, suppliers,
contract or temporary workers, or business
partners or agents. Training is assigned to
newly hired employees after joining the Firm,
and to current employees periodically
thereafter. Employees are required to affirm
their compliance with the Code annually.
Employees can report any potential or actual
violations of the Code through the Firm’s
Conduct Hotline (the “Hotline”) by phone, mobile
device or the internet. The Hotline is
anonymous, where permitted by law, is available
at all times globally, has translation services,
and is administered by an outside service
provider. The Code prohibits retaliation against
anyone who raises an issue or concern in good
faith or assists with an inquiry or
investigation. Periodically, the Audit Committee
receives reports on the Code of Conduct program.

 Management’s discussion and analysis 
 CONDUCT RISK MANAGEMENT 
Conduct risk, a subcategory of operational risk,
is the risk that any action or misconduct by an
employee could lead to unfair client or customer
outcomes, impact the integrity of the markets in
which the Firm operates, harm employees or the
Firm, or compromise the Firm’s reputation.
 Overview 
Each LOB and Corporate is accountable for
identifying and managing its conduct risk to
provide appropriate engagement, ownership and
sustainability of a culture consistent with the
Firm’s Business Principles. The Business
Principles serve as a guide for how employees
are expected to conduct themselves. With the
Business Principles serving as a guide, the
Firm’s Code sets out the Firm’s expectations for
each employee and provides information and
resources to help e mployees conduct business
ethically and in compliance with applicable
laws, rules and regulations everywhere the Firm
operates. Refer to Compliance Risk Management on
page 157 for further discussion of the Code.
 Governance and oversight 
The Firm’s oversight and coordination of conduct
risk is managed in the same manner as Compliance
risk. Refer to Compliance Risk Management on
page 157 for further information.
Conduct risk management encompasses various
aspects of people management practices
throughout the employee life cycle, including
recruiting, onboarding, training and
development, performance management, promotion
and compensation processes. Each LOB, Treasury
and CIO, and each designated corporate function
completes an assessment of conduct risk
periodically, reviews metrics and issues which
may involve conduct risk, and provides conduct
education as appropriate.
 158 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K 
 LEGAL RISK MANAGEMENT 
Legal risk, a subcategory of operational risk,
is the risk of loss primarily caused by the
actual or alleged failure to meet legal
obligations that arise from the rule of law in
jurisdictions in which the Firm operates,
agreements with clients and customers, and
products and services offered by the Firm.
 Overview 
The global Legal function (“Legal”) provides
legal services and advice to the Firm. Legal is
responsible for managing the Firm’s exposure to
legal risk by:
• managing actual and potential litigation and
enforcement matters, including internal reviews
and investigations related to such matters
• advising on products and services, including
contract negotiation and documentation
• advising on offering and marketing documents
and new business initiatives
• managing dispute resolution
• interpreting existing laws, rules and
regulations, and advising on changes to them
• advising on advocacy in connection with
contemplated and proposed laws, rules and
regulations, and
• providing legal advice to the LOBs, Corporate
and the Board.
Legal selects, engages and manages outside
counsel for the Firm on all matters in which
outside counsel is engaged. In addition, Legal
advises the Firm’s Conflicts Office which
reviews the Firm’s wholesale transactions that
may have the potential to create conflicts of
interest for the Firm.
 Governance and oversight 
The Firm’s General Counsel reports to the CEO
and is a member of the Operating Committee, the
Firmwide Risk Committee and the Firmwide Control
Committee. The Firm’s General Counsel and other
members of Legal report on significant legal
matters to the Firm’s Board of Directors and to
the Audit Committee.
Legal serves on and advises various committees
and advises the Firm’s LOBs and Corporate on
potential reputation risk issues.

 Management’s discussion and analysis 
 ESTIMATIONS AND MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT 
Estimations and Model risk, a subcategory of
operational risk, is the potential for adverse
consequences from decisions based on incorrect
or misused estimation outputs.
The Firm uses models and other analytical and
judgment-based estimations, including those
based upon machine learning or artificial
intelligence techniques, across various
businesses and functions. The estimation methods
are of varying levels of sophistication and are
used for many purposes, such as the valuation of
positions and measurement of risk, assessing
regulatory capital requirements, conducting
stress testing, evaluating the allowance for
credit losses and making business decisions. A
dedicated independent function, Model Risk
Governance and Review (“MRGR”), defines and
governs the Firm’s policies relating to the
management of model risk and risks associated
with certain analytical and judgment-based
estimations, such as those used in risk
management, budget forecasting and capital
planning and analysis.
Model risks are owned by the users of the models
within the LOBs and Corporate based on the
specific purposes of such models. Users and
developers of models are responsible for
developing, implementing and testing their
models, as well as referring models to MRGR for
review and approval. Once models have been
approved, model users and developers are
responsible for maintaining a robust operating
environment, and must monitor and evaluate the
performance of the models on an ongoing basis.
Model users and developers may seek to enhance
models in response to changes in the relevant
portfolios and in product and market
developments, as well as to capture improvements
in available modeling techniques and systems
capabilities.
Models are tiered based on an internal standard
according to their complexity, the exposure
associated with the model and the Firm’s
reliance on the model. This tiering is subject
to the approval of MRGR. In its review of a
model, MRGR considers whether the model is
suitable for the specific purposes for which it
will be used. When reviewing a model, MRGR
analyzes and challenges the model methodology
and the reasonableness of model assumptions, and
may perform or require additional testing,
including back-testing of model outcomes. Model
reviews are approved by the appropriate level of
management within MRGR based on the relevant
model tier.
Under the Firm’s Estimations and Model Risk
Management Policy, MRGR reviews and approves new
models, as well as material changes to existing
models, prior to their use. In certain
circumstances, exceptions may be granted to the
Firm’s policy to allow a model to be used prior
to review or approval. MRGR may also require the
user to take appropriate actions to mitigate the
model risk if it is to be used in the interim.
These actions will depend on the model and may
include, for example, limitation of trading
activity.
While models are inherently imprecise, the
degree of imprecision or uncertainty can be
heightened by the market or economic
environment. This is particularly true when the
current and forecasted environments are
significantly different from the historical
environments upon which the models were
developed. This increased uncertainty may
necessitate a greater degree of judgment and
analytics to inform any adjustments that the
Firm may make to model outputs than would
otherwise be the case. In addition, the Firm may
experience increased uncertainty in its
estimates if assets acquired differ from those
used to develop the models.
Refer to Critical Accounting Estimates Used by
the Firm on pages 161–164 and Note 2 for a
summary of model-based valuations and other
valuation techniques.
 160 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM 
JPMorganChase’s accounting policies and use of
estimates are integral to understanding its
reported results. The Firm’s most complex
accounting estimates require management’s
judgment to ascertain the appropriate carrying
value of assets and liabilities. The Firm has
established policies and control procedures
intended to ensure that estimation methods,
including any judgments made as part of such
methods, are well-controlled, independently
reviewed and applied consistently from period to
period. The methods used and judgments made
reflect, among other factors, the nature of the
assets or liabilities and the related business
and risk management strategies, which may vary
across the Firm’s businesses and portfolios. In
addition, the policies and procedures are
intended to ensure that the process for changing
methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner.
The Firm believes its estimates for determining
the carrying value of its assets and liabilities
are appropriate. The following is a brief
description of the Firm’s critical accounting
estimates involving significant judgments.
 Allowance for credit losses 
The Firm’s allowance for credit losses
represents management’s estimate of expected
credit losses over the remaining expected life
of the Firm’s financial assets measured at
amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet
lending-related commitments. The allowance for
credit losses generally comprises:
• The allowance for loan losses, which covers
the Firm’s retained loan portfolios (scored and
risk-rated),
• The allowance for lending-related commitments,
and
• The allowance for credit losses on investment
securities.
The allowance for credit losses involves
significant judgment on a number of matters
including development and weighting of
macroeconomic forecasts, incorporation of
historical loss experience, assessment of risk
characteristics, assignment of risk ratings,
valuation of collateral, and the determination
of remaining expected life. Refer to Note 10 and
Note 13 for further information on these
judgments as well as the Firm’s policies and
methodologies used to determine the Firm’s
allowance for credit losses.
One of the most significant judgments involved
in estimating the Firm’s allowance for credit
losses relates to the macroeconomic forecasts
used to estimate credit losses over the eight-
quarter forecast period within the Firm’s
methodology. The eight-quarter forecast
incorporates hundreds of macroeconomic variables
(“MEVs”) that are relevant for exposures across
the Firm, with modeled credit
losses being driven primarily by a subset of
less than twenty variables. The specific
variables that have the greatest effect on the
modeled losses vary by portfolio and geography.
• Key MEVs for the consumer portfolio include
regional U.S. unemployment rates and U.S. HPI.
• Key MEVs for the wholesale portfolio include
U.S. unemployment, U.S. real GDP, U.S. equity
prices, U.S. interest rates, U.S. corporate
credit spreads, oil prices, U.S. commercial real
estate prices and U.S. HPI.
Changes in the Firm’s assumptions and forecasts
of economic conditions could significantly
affect its estimate of expected credit losses in
the portfolio at the balance sheet date or lead
to significant changes in the estimate from one
reporting period to the next.
As a result of the First Republic acquisition,
the Firm recorded an allowance for credit losses
for the loans acquired and lending-related
commitments assumed as of May 1, 2023. Due to
differences in risk rating methodologies for the
First Republic portfolio and the ongoing
integration of products and systems, the
allowance for credit losses for the acquired
wholesale portfolio was initially measured based
on similar risk characteristics from other
facilities underwritten by the Firm. Starting in
the second quarter of 2024, the acquired
portfolio was incorporated into the Firm's
modeled credit loss estimates and is now
reflected in the wholesale sensitivity analysis
below. Refer to Note 34 for additional
information on the First Republic acquisition.
It is difficult to estimate how potential
changes in any one factor or input might affect
the overall allowance for credit losses because
management considers a wide variety of factors
and inputs in estimating the allowance for
credit losses. Changes in the factors and inputs
considered may not occur at the same rate and
may not be consistent across all geographies or
product types, and changes in factors and inputs
may be directionally inconsistent, such that
improvement in one factor or input may offset
deterioration in others.
To consider the impact of a hypothetical
alternate macroeconomic forecast, the Firm
compared the modeled credit losses determined
using its central and relative adverse
macroeconomic scenarios, which are two of the
five scenarios considered in estimating the
allowances for loan losses and lending-related
commitments. The central and relative adverse
scenarios each included a full suite of MEVs,
but differed in the levels, paths and
peaks/troughs of those variables over the eight-
quarter forecast period.
For example, compared to the Firm’s central
scenario shown on page 137 and in Note 13, the
Firm’s relative adverse scenario assumes an
elevated U.S.
 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K 161 
 Management’s discussion and analysis 
unemployment rate, averaging approximately 2.1%
higher over the eight-quarter forecast, with a
peak difference of approximately 3.0% in the
fourth quarter of 2025. This analysis is not
intended to estimate expected future changes in
the allowance for credit losses, for a number of
reasons, including: • The allowance as of
December 31, 2024, reflects credit losses beyond
those estimated under the central scenario due
to the weight placed on the adverse scenarios. •
The impacts of changes in many MEVs are both
interrelated and nonlinear, so the results of
this analysis cannot be simply extrapolated for
more severe changes in macroeconomic variables.
• Expectations of future changes in portfolio
composition and borrower behavior can
significantly affect the allowance for credit
losses. To demonstrate the sensitivity of credit
loss estimates to macroeconomic forecasts as of
December 31, 2024, the Firm compared the modeled
estimates under its relative adverse scenario to
its central scenario. Without considering
offsetting or correlated effects in other
qualitative components of the Firm’s allowance
for credit losses, the comparison between these
two scenarios for the exposures below reflect
the following differences: • An increase of
approximately $850 million for residential real
estate loans and lending-related commitments •
An increase of approximately $3.7 billion for
credit card loans • An increase of approximately
$4.1 billion for wholesale loans and lending-
related commitments This analysis relates only
to the modeled credit loss estimates and is not
intended to estimate changes in the overall
allowance for credit losses as it does not
reflect any potential changes in other
adjustments to the quantitative calculation,
which would also be influenced by the judgment
management applies to the modeled lifetime loss
estimates to reflect the uncertainty and
imprecision of these modeled lifetime loss
estimates based on then-current circumstances
and conditions. Recognizing that forecasts of
macroeconomic conditions are inherently
uncertain, the Firm believes that its process to
consider the available information and
associated risks and uncertainties is
appropriately governed and that its estimates of
expected credit losses were reasonable and
appropriate for the period ended December 31,
2024 .
Fair value JPMorganChase carries a portion of
its assets and liabilities at fair value. The
majority of such assets and liabilities are
measured at fair value on a recurring basis,
including derivatives, structured note products
and certain securities financing agreements.
Certain assets and liabilities are measured at
fair value on a nonrecurring basis, including
certain mortgage, home equity and other loans,
where the carrying value is based on the fair
value of the underlying collateral. Assets
measured at fair value The following table
includes the Firm’s assets measured at fair

 162 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K 
Valuation
Details of the Firm’s processes for determining
fair value are set out in Note 2. Estimating
fair value requires the application of judgment.
The type and level of judgment required is
largely dependent on the amount of observable
market information available to the Firm. For
instruments valued using internally developed
valuation models and other valuation techniques
that use significant unobservable inputs and are
therefore classified within level 3 of the fair
value hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair
value are more significant than those required
when estimating the fair value of instruments
classified within levels 1 and 2.
In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an
instrument within level 3, management must first
determine the appropriate valuation model or
other valuation technique to use. Second, the
lack of observability of certain significant
inputs requires management to assess relevant
empirical data in deriving valuation inputs
including, for example, transaction details,
yield curves, interest rates, prepayment speeds,
default rates, volatilities, correlations,
prices (such as commodity, equity or debt
prices), valuations of comparable instruments,
foreign exchange rates and credit curves. Refer
to Note 2 for a further discussion of the
valuation of level 3 instruments, including
unobservable inputs used.
For instruments classified in levels 2 and 3,
management judgment must be applied to assess
the appropriate level of valuation adjustments
to reflect counterparty credit quality, the
Firm’s creditworthiness, market funding rates,
liquidity considerations, unobservable
parameters, and for portfolios that meet
specified criteria, the size of the net open
risk position. The judgments made are typically
affected by the type of product and its specific
contractual terms, and the level of liquidity
for the product or within the market as a whole.
In periods of heightened market volatility and
uncertainty judgments are further affected by
the wider variation of reasonable valuation
estimates, particularly for positions that are
less liquid. Refer to Note 2 for a further
discussion of valuation adjustments applied by
the Firm.
Imprecision in estimating unobservable market
inputs or other factors can affect the amount of
gain or loss recorded for a particular position.
Furthermore, while the Firm believes its
valuation methods are appropriate and consistent
with those of other market participants, the
methods and assumptions used reflect management
judgment and may vary across the Firm’s
businesses and portfolios.
The Firm uses various methodologies and
assumptions in the determination of fair value.
The use of methodologies or assumptions
different than those used by the Firm could
result in a different estimate of fair value at
the reporting date. Refer to Note 2 for a
detailed discussion of the Firm’s valuation
process and
hierarchy, and its determination of fair value
for individual financial instruments.
 Goodwill impairment 
Under U.S. GAAP, goodwill must be allocated to
reporting units and tested for impairment at
least annually. The Firm’s process and
methodology used to conduct goodwill impairment
testing is described in Note 15.
Management applies significant judgment when
testing goodwill for impairment. The goodwill
associated with each business combination is
allocated to the related reporting units for
goodwill impairment testing.
For the year ended December 31, 2024, the Firm
reviewed current economic conditions, estimated
market cost of equity, as well as actual
business results and projections of business
performance. Based on such reviews, the Firm has
concluded that goodwill was not impaired as of
December 31, 2024. For each of the reporting
units, fair value exceeded carrying value by at
least 10% and there was no indication of a
significant risk of goodwill impairment based on
current projections and valuations.
The projections for the Firm’s reporting units
are consistent with management’s current
business outlook assumptions in the short term,
and the Firm’s best estimates of long-term
growth and return on equity in the longer term.
Where possible, the Firm uses third-party and
peer data to benchmark its assumptions and
estimates.
Refer to Note 15 for additional information on
goodwill, including the goodwill impairment
assessment as of December 31, 2024.
 Credit card rewards liability 
JPMorganChase offers credit cards with various
rewards programs which allow cardholders to earn
rewards points based on their account activity
and the terms and conditions of the rewards
program. Generally, there are no limits on the
points that an eligible cardholder can earn, nor
do the points expire, and the points can be
redeemed for a variety of rewards, including
cash (predominantly in the form of account
credits), gift cards and travel. The Firm
maintains a rewards liability which represents
the estimated cost of rewards points earned and
expected to be redeemed by cardholders. The
liability is accrued as the cardholder earns the
benefit and is reduced when the cardholder
redeems points. This liability was $14.4 billion
and $13.2 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023,
respectively, and is recorded in accounts
payable and other liabilities on the
Consolidated balance sheets. The increase in the
liability was driven by continued growth in
rewards points earned on higher spend and
promotional offers outpacing redemptions
throughout 2024.
The rewards liability is sensitive to redemption
rate (“RR”) and cost per point (“CPP”)
assumptions. The RR
 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K 163 
 Management’s discussion and analysis 
assumption is used to estimate the number of
points earned by customers that will be redeemed
over the life of the account. The CPP assumption
is used to estimate the cost of future point
redemptions. These assumptions are evaluated
periodically considering historical actuals,
cardholder redemption behavior and management
judgment. Updates to these assumptions will
impact the rewards liability. As of December 31,
2024, a combined increase of 25 basis points in
RR and 1 basis point in CPP would increase the
rewards liability by approximately $442 million.
 Income taxes 
JPMorganChase is subject to the income tax laws
of the various jurisdictions in which it
operates, including U.S. federal, state and
local, and non-U.S. jurisdictions. These laws
are often complex and may be subject to
different interpretations. To determine the
financial statement impact of accounting for
income taxes, including the provision for income
tax expense and unrecognized tax benefits,
JPMorganChase must make assumptions and
judgments about how to interpret and apply these
complex tax laws to numerous transactions and
business events, as well as make judgments
regarding the timing of when certain items may
affect taxable income in the U.S. and non-U.S.
tax jurisdictions.
JPMorganChase’s interpretations of tax laws
around the world are subject to review and
examination by the various taxing authorities in
the jurisdictions where the Firm operates, and
disputes may occur regarding its view on a tax
position. These disputes over interpretations
with the various taxing authorities may be
settled by audit, administrative appeals or
adjudication in the court systems of the tax
jurisdictions in which the Firm operates.
JPMorganChase regularly reviews whether it may
be assessed additional income taxes as a result
of the resolution of these matters, and the Firm
records additional unrecognized tax benefits, as
appropriate. In addition, the Firm may revise
its estimate of income taxes due to changes in
income tax laws, legal interpretations, and
business strategies. It is possible that
revisions in the Firm’s estimate of income taxes
may materially affect the Firm’s results of
operations in any reporting period.
Deferred taxes arise from differences between
assets and liabilities measured for financial
reporting versus income tax return purposes.
Deferred tax assets are recognized if, in
management’s judgment, their realizability is
determined to be more likely than not. Deferred
taxes are measured using enacted tax rates
expected to apply to taxable income in the years
in which those temporary differences are
expected to be recovered or settled. The effect
on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is
recognized within the provision for income taxes
in the period enacted.
The Firm has also recognized deferred tax assets
in connection with certain tax attributes,
including net operating loss (“NOL”)
carryforwards and foreign tax
credit (“FTC”) carryforwards. The Firm performs
regular reviews to ascertain whether its
deferred tax assets are realizable. These
reviews include management’s estimates and
assumptions regarding future taxable income,
including foreign source income, and may
incorporate various tax planning strategies,
including strategies that may be available to
utilize NOLs and FTCs before they expire. In
connection with these reviews, if it is
determined that a deferred tax asset is not
realizable, a valuation allowance is
established. The valuation allowance may be
reversed in a subsequent reporting period if the
Firm determines that, based on revised estimates
of future taxable income or changes in tax
planning strategies, it is more likely than not
that all or part of the deferred tax asset will
become realizable. As of December 31, 2024,
management has determined it is more likely than
not that the Firm will realize its deferred tax
assets, net of the existing valuation allowance.
The Firm adjusts its unrecognized tax benefits
as necessary when new information becomes
available, including changes in tax law and
regulations, and interactions with taxing
authorities. Uncertain tax positions that meet
the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold
are measured to determine the amount of benefit
to recognize. An uncertain tax position is
measured at the largest amount of benefit that
management believes is more likely than not to
be realized upon settlement. It is possible that
the reassessment of JPMorganChase’s unrecognized
tax benefits may have a material impact on its
effective income tax rate in the period in which
the reassessment occurs. Although the Firm
believes that its estimates are reasonable, the
final tax amount could be different from the
amounts reflected in the Firm’s income tax
provisions and accruals. To the extent that the
final outcome of these amounts is different than
the amounts recorded, such differences will
generally impact the Firm’s provision for income
taxes in the period in which such a
determination is made.
The Firm’s provision for income taxes is
composed of current and deferred taxes. The
current and deferred tax provisions are
calculated based on estimates and assumptions
that could differ from the actual results
reflected in income tax returns filed during the
subsequent year. Adjustments based on filed
returns are generally recorded in the period
when the tax returns are filed and the global
tax implications are known, which could impact
the Firm’s effective tax rate.

income taxes.

Management’s report on internal control over
financial reporting
Management of JPMorgan Chase & Co.
(“JPMorganChase” or the “Firm”) is responsible
for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting.
Internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed by, or under the supervision
of, the Firm’s principal executive and principal
financial officers, or persons performing
similar functions, and effected by
JPMorganChase’s Board of Directors, management
and other personnel, to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).
JPMorganChase’s internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records,
that, in reasonable detail, accurately and
fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
of the Firm’s assets; (2) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and
that receipts and expenditures of the Firm are
being made only in accordance with
authorizations of JPMorganChase’s management and
directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of
the Firm’s assets that could have a material
effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls
may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Management has completed an assessment of the
effectiveness of the Firm’s internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31,
2024. In making the assessment, management used
the “Internal Control — Integrated Framework”
(“COSO 2013”) promulgated by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (“COSO”).
Based upon the assessment performed, management
concluded that as of December 31, 2024,
JPMorganChase’s internal control over financial
reporting was effective based upon the COSO 2013
framework. Additionally, based upon management’s
assessment, the Firm determined that there were
no material weaknesses in its internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31,
2024.
The effectiveness of the Firm’s internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31,
2024, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP, an independent registered public accounting
firm, as stated in their report which appears
herein.

 168 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K 
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
JPMorgan Chase & Co.:
Opinions on the Financial Statements and
Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its
subsidiaries (the “Firm”) as of December 31,
2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated
statements of income, comprehensive income,
changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2024, including the related notes
(collectively referred to as the “consolidated
financial statements”). We also have audited the
Firm’s internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria
established in Internal Control - Integrated
Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of
the Firm as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and
the results of its operations and its cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. Also in our opinion, the Firm
maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2024, based on criteria established
in Internal Control – Integrated Framework
(2013) issued by the COSO.
 Basis for Opinions 
The Firm’s management is responsible for these
consolidated financial statements, for
maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting, and for its assessment of
the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting, included in the
accompanying Management’s report on internal
control over financial reporting. Our
responsibility is to express opinions on the
Firm’s consolidated financial statements and on
the Firm’s internal control over financial
reporting based on our audits. We are a public
accounting firm registered with the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States) (PCAOB) and are required to be
independent with respect to the Firm in
accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws
and the applicable rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the
PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the
consolidated financial
statements are free of material misstatement,
whether due to error or fraud, and whether
effective internal control over financial
reporting was maintained in all material
respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial
statements included performing procedures to
assess the risks of material misstatement of the
consolidated financial statements, whether due
to error or fraud, and performing procedures
that respond to those risks. Such procedures
included examining, on a test basis, evidence
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the
consolidated financial statements. Our audits
also included evaluating the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made
by management, as well as evaluating the overall
presentation of the consolidated financial
statements. Our audit of internal control over
financial reporting included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal
control based on the assessed risk. Our audits
also included performing such other procedures
as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control
over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial
reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. A company’s internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions
and dispositions of the assets of the company;
(ii) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures
of the company are being made only in accordance
with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of the company’s assets that could
have a material effect on the financial
statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls
may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 Critical Audit Matters 
The critical audit matters communicated below
are matters arising from the current period
audit of the consolidated financial statements
that were communicated or required to be
communicated to the audit committee and that (i)
relate to accounts or disclosures that are
material to the consolidated financial
statements and (ii) involved our especially
challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.
The communication of critical audit matters does
not alter in any way our opinion on the
consolidated financial statements, taken as a
whole, and we are not, by communicating the
critical audit matters below, providing separate
opinions on the critical audit matters or on the
accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Allowance for Loan Losses – Portfolio-based
component of Wholesale Loan and Credit Card Loan
Portfolios
As described in Note 13 to the consolidated
financial statements, the allowance for loan
losses for the portfolio-based component of the
wholesale and credit card loan portfolios was
$22.0 billion on total portfolio-based retained
loans of $919.3 billion at December 31, 2024 .
The Firm’s allowance for loan losses represents
management’s estimate of expected credit losses
over the remaining expected life of the Firm's
loan portfolios and considers expected future
changes in macroeconomic conditions. The
portfolio-based component of the Firm’s
allowance for loan losses for the wholesale and
credit card retained loan portfolios begins with
a quantitative calculation of expected credit
losses over the expected life of the loan by
applying credit loss factors to the estimated
exposure at default. The credit loss factors
applied are determined based on the weighted
average of five internally developed
macroeconomic scenarios that take into
consideration the Firm's economic outlook as
derived through forecast macroeconomic
variables, the most significant of which are
U.S. unemployment and U.S. real gross domestic
product. This quantitative calculation is
further adjusted to take into consideration
model imprecision, emerging risk assessments,
trends and other subjective factors that are not
yet otherwise reflected in the credit loss
estimate.
The principal considerations for our
determination that performing procedures
relating to the allowance for loan losses for
the portfolio-based component of the wholesale
and credit card loan portfolios is a critical
audit matter are (i) the significant judgment
and estimation by management in the forecast of
macroeconomic variables, specifically U.S.
unemployment and U.S. real gross domestic
product, as the Firm’s forecasts of economic
conditions significantly affect its estimate of
expected credit losses at the balance sheet
date, (ii) the significant
judgment and estimation by management in
determining the quantitative calculation
utilized in their credit loss estimates and the
adjustments to take into consideration model
imprecision, emerging risk assessments, trends
and other subjective factors that are not yet
otherwise reflected in the credit loss estimate,
which in turn led to a high degree of auditor
judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing
procedures and in evaluating audit evidence
obtained relating to the credit loss estimates
and the appropriateness of the adjustments to
the credit loss estimates, and (iii) the audit
effort involved the use of professionals with
specialized skill and knowledge.
Addressing the matter involved performing
procedures and evaluating audit evidence in
connection with forming our overall opinion on
the consolidated financial statements. These
procedures included testing the effectiveness of
controls relating to the Firm’s allowance for
loan losses, including controls over model
validation and generation of macroeconomic
scenarios. These procedures also included, among
others, testing management’s process for
estimating the allowance for loan losses, which
involved (i) evaluating the appropriateness of
the models and methodologies used in
quantitative calculations; (ii) evaluating the
reasonableness of forecasts of U.S. unemployment
and U.S. real gross domestic product; (iii)
testing the completeness and accuracy of data
used in the estimate; and (iv) evaluating the
reasonableness of management’s adjustments to
the quantitative output for the impacts of model
imprecision, emerging risk assessments, trends
and other subjective factors that are not yet
otherwise reflected in the credit loss estimate.
These procedures also included the use of
professionals with specialized skill and
knowledge to assist in evaluating the
appropriateness of certain models, methodologies
and macroeconomic variables.
Fair Value of Certain Level 3 Financial
Instruments
As described in Notes 2 and 3 to the
consolidated financial statements, the Firm
carries $1.5 trillion of its assets and $586.2
billion of its liabilities at fair value on a
recurring basis. Included in these balances are
$10.9 billion of trading assets and $51.8
billion of liabilities measured at fair value on
a recurring basis, collectively financial
instruments, which are classified as level 3 as
they contain one or more inputs to valuation
which are unobservable and significant to their
fair value measurement. The Firm utilized
internally developed valuation models and
unobservable inputs to estimate fair value of
the level 3 financial instruments. The
unobservable inputs used by management to
estimate the fair value of certain of these
financial instruments include interest rate
volatility, equity volatility, Bermudan switch
value and correlation relating to interest
rates, interest rate-to-foreign exchange,
 170 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K 
Report of Independent Registered Public
Accounting Firm
equity prices, equity-to-foreign exchange and
equity-to-interest rate.
The principal considerations for our
determination that performing procedures
relating to the fair value of certain level 3
financial instruments is a critical audit matter
are (i) the significant judgment and estimation
by management in determining the inputs to
estimate fair value, which in turn led to a high
degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and
effort in performing procedures and in
evaluating audit evidence obtained related to
the fair value of these financial instruments,
and (ii) the audit effort involved the use of
professionals with specialized skill and
knowledge.
Addressing the matter involved performing
procedures and evaluating audit evidence in
connection with forming our overall opinion on
the consolidated financial statements. These
procedures included testing the effectiveness of
controls relating to the Firm’s determination of
the fair value, including controls over models,
inputs, and data. These procedures also
included, among others, the involvement of
professionals with specialized skill and
knowledge to assist in developing an independent
estimate of fair value for a sample of these
financial instruments and comparing management’s
estimate to the independently developed estimate
of fair value. Developing the independent
estimate involved testing the completeness and
accuracy of data provided by management,
developing independent inputs and, as
appropriate, evaluating and utilizing
management’s aforementioned unobservable inputs.

 176 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K 
 Notes to consolidated financial statements 
 Note 1 – Basis of presentation 
JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorganChase” or the “Firm”), a financial holding company incorporated under
Delaware law in 1968, is a leading financial services firm based in the U.S., with operations
worldwide. The Firm is a leader in investment banking, financial services for consumers and small
businesses, commercial banking, financial transaction processing and asset management. Refer to Note
32 for further discussion of the Firm's reportable business segments. The accounting and financial
reporting policies of JPMorganChase and its subsidiaries conform to U.S. GAAP. Additionally, where
applicable, the policies conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by regulatory
authorities. Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of
JPMorganChase and other entities in which the Firm has a controlling financial interest. All material
intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Assets held for clients in an agency or
fiduciary capacity by the Firm are not assets of JPMorganChase and are not included on the
Consolidated balance sheets. The Firm determines whether it has a controlling financial interest in
an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a variable interest
entity. Voting interest entities Voting interest entities are entities that have sufficient equity
and provide the equity investors voting rights that enable them to make significant decisions
relating to the entity’s operations. For these types of entities, the Firm’s determination of whether
it has a controlling interest is primarily based on the amount of voting equity interests held.
Entities in which the Firm has a controlling financial interest, through ownership of the majority of
the entities’ voting equity interests, or through other contractual rights that give the Firm
control, are consolidated by the Firm. Investments in companies in which the Firm has significant
influence over operating and financing decisions (but does not own a majority of the voting equity
interests) are accounted for (i) in accordance with the equity method of accounting, or (ii) at fair
value if the fair value option was elected. These investments are generally included in other assets,
with income or loss included in noninterest revenue. Certain Firm-sponsored asset management funds
are structured as limited partnerships or limited liability companies. For many of these entities,
the Firm is the general partner or managing member, but the non-affiliated partners or members have
the ability to remove the Firm as the general partner or managing member without cause (i.e., kick-
out rights), based on a simple majority vote, or the non-affiliated partners or members have rights
to participate in important decisions. Accordingly, the Firm does not consolidate these voting
interest entities. However, in the limited cases where the non-managing partners or members do not
have substantive kick-out or participating rights, the Firm evaluates the funds as VIEs and
consolidates the funds if the Firm is the general partner or managing member and has both power and a
potentially significant interest. The Firm’s investment companies and asset management funds have
investments in both publicly-held and privately-held entities, including investments in buyouts,
growth equity and venture opportunities. These investments are accounted for under investment company
guidelines and, accordingly, irrespective of the percentage of equity ownership interests held, are
carried on the Consolidated balance sheets at fair value, and are recorded in other assets, with
income or loss included in noninterest revenue. If consolidated, the Firm retains the accounting
under such specialized investment company guidelines. Variable interest entities VIEs are entities
that, by design, either (1) lack sufficient equity to permit the entity to finance its activities
without additional subordinated financial support from other parties, or (2) have equity investors
that do not have the ability to make significant decisions relating to the entity’s operations
through voting rights, or do not have the obligation to absorb the expected losses, or do not have
the right to receive the residual returns of the entity. The most common type of VIE is an SPE. SPEs
are commonly used in securitization transactions in order to isolate certain assets and distribute
the cash flows from those assets to investors. The basic SPE structure involves a company selling
assets to the SPE; the SPE funds the purchase of those assets by issuing securities to investors. The
legal documents that govern the transaction specify how the cash earned on the assets must be
allocated to the SPE’s investors and other parties that have rights to those cash flows. SPEs are
generally structured to insulate investors from claims on the SPE’s assets by creditors of other
entities, including the creditors of the seller of the assets. The primary beneficiary of a VIE
(i.e., the party that has a controlling financial interest) is required to consolidate the assets and
liabilities of the VIE. The
 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K 177 
 Notes to consolidated financial statements 
primary beneficiary is the party that has both (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that
most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance; and (2) through its interests in the VIE,
the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially
be significant to the VIE. To assess whether the Firm has the power to direct the activities of a VIE
that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, the Firm considers all the facts and
circumstances, including its role in establishing the VIE and its ongoing rights and
responsibilities. This assessment includes, first, identifying the activities that most significantly
impact the VIE’s economic performance; and second, identifying which party, if any, has power over
those activities. In general, the parties that make the most significant decisions affecting the VIE
(such as asset managers, collateral managers, servicers, or owners of call options or liquidation
rights over the VIE’s assets) or have the right to unilaterally remove those decision-makers are
deemed to have the power to direct the activities of a VIE. To assess whether the Firm has the
obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could
potentially be significant to the VIE, the Firm considers all of its economic interests, including
debt and equity investments, servicing fees, and derivatives or other arrangements deemed to be
variable interests in the VIE. This assessment requires that the Firm apply judgment in determining
whether these interests, in the aggregate, are considered potentially significant to the VIE. Factors
considered in assessing significance include: the design of the VIE, including its capitalization
structure; subordination of interests; payment priority; relative share of interests held across
various classes within the VIE’s capital structure; and the reasons why the interests are held by the
Firm. The Firm performs on-going reassessments of: (1) whether entities previously evaluated under
the majority voting-interest framework have become VIEs, based on certain events, and are therefore
subject to the VIE consolidation framework; and (2) whether changes in the facts and circumstances
regarding the Firm’s involvement with a VIE cause the Firm’s consolidation conclusion to change.
Refer to Note 14 for further discussion of Firm-sponsored VIEs. Revenue recognition Interest income
The Firm recognizes interest income on loans, debt securities, and other debt instruments, generally
on a level-yield basis, based on the underlying contractual rate. Refer to Note 7 for further
information. Revenue from contracts with customers JPMorganChase recognizes noninterest revenue from
certain contracts with customers , in investment banking fees, deposit-related fees, asset management
fees, commissions and other fees, and components of card income, when the Firm’s related performance
obligations are satisfied. Refer to Note 6 for further discussion of the Firm’s revenue from
contracts with customers. Principal transactions revenue JPMorganChase carries a portion of its
assets and liabilities at fair value. Changes in fair value are reported primarily in principal
transactions revenue. Refer to Notes 2 and 3 for further discussion of fair value measurement. Refer
to Note 6 for further discussion of principal transactions revenue. Use of estimates in the
preparation of consolidated financial statements The preparation of the Consolidated Financial
Statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities, revenue and expense, and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.
Actual results could be different from these estimates. Foreign currency translation JPMorganChase
revalues assets, liabilities, revenue and expense denominated in non-U.S. currencies into U.S.
dollars using applicable exchange rates. Gains and losses relating to translating functional currency
financial statements for U.S. reporting are included in the Consolidated statements of comprehensive
income. Gains and losses relating to nonfunctional currency transactions, including non-U.S.
operations where the functional currency is the U.S. dollar, are reported in the Consolidated
statements of income. Offsetting assets and liabilities U.S. GAAP permits entities to present
derivative receivables and derivative payables with the same counterparty and the related cash
collateral receivables and payables on a net basis on the Consolidated balance sheets when a legally
enforceable master netting agreement exists. U.S. GAAP also permits securities sold and purchased
under repurchase agreements and securities borrowed or loaned under securities loan agreements to be
presented net when specified conditions are met, including the existence of a legally enforceable
master netting agreement. The Firm has elected to net such balances where it has determined that the
specified conditions are met. The Firm uses master netting agreements to mitigate counterparty credit
risk in certain transactions, including derivative contracts, resale, repurchase, securities borrowed
and securities loaned
 178 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K 
agreements. A master netting agreement is a single agreement with a counterparty that permits
multiple transactions governed by that agreement to be terminated or accelerated and settled through
a single payment in a single currency in the event of a default (e.g., bankruptcy, failure to make a
required payment or securities transfer or deliver collateral or margin when due). Upon the exercise
of derivatives termination rights by the non-defaulting party (i) all transactions are terminated,
(ii) all transactions are valued and the positive values of “in the money” transactions are netted
against the negative values of “out of the money” transactions and (iii) the only remaining payment
obligation is of one of the parties to pay the netted termination amount. Upon exercise of default
rights under repurchase agreements and securities loan agreements in general (i) all transactions are
terminated and accelerated, (ii) all values of securities or cash held or to be delivered are
calculated, and all such sums are netted against each other and (iii) the only remaining payment
obligation is of one of the parties to pay the netted termination amount. Typical master netting
agreements for these types of transactions also often contain a collateral/margin agreement that
provides for a security interest in, or title transfer of, securities or cash collateral/margin to
the party that has the right to demand margin (the “demanding party”). The collateral/margin
agreement typically requires a party to transfer collateral/margin to the demanding party with a
value equal to the amount of the margin deficit on a net basis across all transactions governed by
the master netting agreement, less any threshold. The collateral/margin agreement grants to the
demanding party, upon default by the counterparty, the right to set-off any amounts payable by the
counterparty against any posted collateral or the cash equivalent of any posted collateral/margin. It
also grants to the demanding party the right to liquidate collateral/margin and to apply the proceeds
to an amount payable by the counterparty. Refer to Note 5 for further discussion of the Firm’s
derivative instruments. Refer to Note 11 for further discussion of the Firm’s securities financing
agreements. Statements of cash flows For JPMorganChase’s Consolidated statements of cash flows, cash
is defined as those amounts included in cash and due from banks and deposits with banks on the
Consolidated balance sheets. Accounting standard adopted January 1, 2024 Equity Method and Joint
Ventures: Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization
Method The guidance expanded the types of tax-oriented investments, beyond affordable housing tax
credit investments, that the Firm can elect on a program by program basis, to be accounted for using
the proportional amortization method. This method requires the cost of eligible investments, within
an elected program, to be amortized in proportion to the tax benefits received with the resulting
amortization reported directly in income tax expense, which aligns with the associated tax credits
and other tax benefits. Eligible investments must meet certain criteria, including that substantially
all of the return is from income tax credits and other income tax benefits. This guidance was adopted
on January 1, 2024 under the modified retrospective method. The adoption of this guidance resulted in
a change to the classification and timing of the amortization associated with certain of the Firm's
alternative energy tax-oriented investments. As a result of the adoption, the amortization of these
investments that was previously recognized in other income is now recognized in income tax expense.
The change in accounting resulted in a decrease to retained earnings of $ 161million and increased
the Firm’s income tax expense and the effective tax rate by approximately $ 450million and
twopercentage points, respectively, in the first quarter of 2024, with no material impact to net
income. The guidance requires additional disclosure for all investments that generate income tax
credits and other income tax benefits from a tax-oriented investment program for which the Firm has
elected to apply the proportional amortization method. The guidance also requires a reevaluation of
eligible investments when significant modifications or events occur that result in a change in the
nature of the investment or a change in the Firm's relationship with the underlying project. Refer to
Notes 6, 14 and 25 for additional information. Accounting standards adopted January 1, 2023
Derivatives and Hedging: Fair Value Hedging – Portfolio Layer Method The adoption of this guidance
expanded the ability to hedge a portfolio of fixed-rate assets in a qualifying hedge accounting
relationship. As permitted by the guidance, the Firm elected to transfer HTM securities to AFS and
designated those securities in a portfolio layer method hedge upon adoption. The adoption impact of
the transfer on retained earnings was not material.

 Notes to consolidated financial statements 
Financial Instruments – Credit Losses: Troubled
Debt Restructurings (“TDRs”) The adoption of
this guidance eliminated the requirement to
measure the allowance for TDRs using a
discounted cash flow (“DCF”) methodology and
allowed the option of a non-DCF portfolio-based
approach for modified loans to troubled
borrowers. The Firm elected this option for all
portfolios of modified loans to troubled
borrowers except collateral-dependent loans and
nonaccrual risk-rated loans, for which the Firm
elected to continue applying a DCF methodology.
The adoption of this guidance under the modified
retrospective method on January 1, 2023,
resulted in a $ 446million increase to retained
earnings.

 Note 2 – Fair value measurement 
JPMorganChase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities at fair value. These assets and
liabilities are predominantly carried at fair value on a recurring basis (i.e., assets and
liabilities that are measured and reported at fair value on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets).
Certain assets, liabilities and unfunded lending-related commitments are measured at fair value on a
nonrecurring basis; that is, they are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject
to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances (for example, when there is evidence of
impairment). Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to
transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
Fair value is based on quoted market prices or inputs, where available. If prices or quotes are not
available, fair value is based on valuation models and other valuation techniques that consider
relevant transaction characteristics (such as maturity) and use, as inputs, observable or
unobservable market parameters, including yield curves, interest rates, volatilities, prices (such as
commodity, equity or debt prices), correlations, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. Fair value
may also incorporate valuation adjustments. The level of precision in estimating unobservable market
inputs or other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded for a particular position.
Furthermore, while the Firm believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with those
of other market participants, the methods and assumptions used reflect management judgment and may
vary across the Firm’s businesses and portfolios. The Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions
in the determination of fair value. The use of different methodologies or assumptions by other market
participants compared with those used by the Firm could result in the Firm deriving a different
estimate of fair value at the reporting date. Valuation process Risk-taking functions are responsible
for providing fair value estimates for assets and liabilities carried on the Consolidated balance
sheets at fair value. The Firm’s Valuation Control Group (“VCG”), which is part of the Firm’s Finance
function and independent of the risk-taking functions, is responsible for verifying these estimates
and determining any fair value adjustments that may be required to ensure that the Firm’s positions
are recorded at fair value. In addition, the Firm’s Valuation Governance Forum (“VGF”), which is
composed of senior finance and risk executives, is responsible for overseeing the management of risks
arising from valuation activities conducted across the Firm. The Firmwide VGF is chaired by the
Firmwide head of the VCG (under the direction of the Firm’s Controller), and includes sub-forums
covering the CIB, CCB, AWM and certain corporate functions including Treasury and CIO. Price
verification process The VCG verifies fair value estimates provided by the risk-taking functions by
leveraging independently derived prices, valuation inputs and other market data, where available.
Where independent prices or inputs are not available, the VCG performs additional review to ensure
the reasonableness of the estimates. The additional review may include evaluating the limited market
activity including client unwinds, benchmarking valuation inputs to those used for similar
instruments, decomposing the valuation of structured instruments into individual components,
comparing expected to actual cash flows, reviewing profit and loss trends, and reviewing trends in
collateral valuation. There are also additional levels of management review for more significant or
complex positions. The VCG determines any valuation adjustments that may be required to the estimates
provided by the risk-taking functions. No adjustments to quoted prices are applied for instruments
classified within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy (refer to the discussion of the fair value
hierarchy on page 182 for further information). For other positions, judgment is required to assess
the need for valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect liquidity considerations, unobservable
parameters, and, for certain portfolios that meet specified criteria, the size of the net open risk
position. The determination of such adjustments follows a consistent framework across the Firm: •
Liquidity valuation adjustments are considered where an observable external price or valuation
parameter exists but is of lower reliability, potentially due to lower market activity. Liquidity
valuation adjustments are made based on current market conditions. Factors that may be considered in
determining the liquidity adjustment include analysis of: (1) the estimated bid-offer spread for the
instrument being traded; (2) alternative pricing points for similar instruments in active markets;
and (3) the range of reasonable values that the price or parameter could take. • The Firm manages
certain portfolios of financial instruments on the basis of net open risk exposure and, as permitted
by U.S. GAAP, has elected to estimate the fair value of such portfolios on the basis of a transfer of
the entire net open risk position in an orderly transaction. Where this is the case, valuation
adjustments may be necessary to reflect the cost of exiting a larger-than-normal market-size net open
risk position. Where applied, such adjustments are
 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K 181 
 Notes to consolidated financial statements 
based on factors that a relevant market participant would consider in the transfer of the net open
risk position, including the size of the adverse market move that is likely to occur during the
period required to sufficiently reduce the net open risk position. • Uncertainty adjustments related
to unobservable parameters may be made when positions are valued using prices or input parameters to
valuation models that are unobservable due to a lack of market activity or because they cannot be
implied from observable market data. Such prices or parameters must be estimated and are, therefore,
subject to management judgment. Adjustments are made to reflect the uncertainty inherent in the
resulting valuation estimate. • Where appropriate, the Firm also applies adjustments to its estimates
of fair value in order to appropriately reflect counterparty credit quality (CVA), the Firm’s own
creditworthiness (DVA) and the impact of funding (FVA), using a consistent framework across the Firm.
Refer to Credit and funding adjustments on page 198 of this Note for more information on such
adjustments. Valuation model review and approval If prices or quotes are not available for an
instrument or a similar instrument, fair value is generally determined using valuation models that
consider relevant transaction terms such as maturity and use as inputs market-based or independently
sourced parameters. Where this is the case the price verification process described above is applied
to the inputs in those models. Under the Firm’s Estimations and Model Risk Management Policy, MRGR
reviews and approves new models, as well as material changes to existing models, prior to
implementation in the operating environment. In certain circumstances exceptions may be granted to
the Firm’s policy to allow a model to be used prior to review or approval. MRGR may also require the
user to take appropriate actions to mitigate the model risk if it is to be used in the interim. These
actions will depend on the model and may include, for example, limitation of trading activity. Fair
value hierarchy A three-level fair value hierarchy has been established under U.S. GAAP for
disclosure of fair value measurements. The fair value hierarchy is based on the observability of
inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. The three levels are
defined as follows. • Level 1 – inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted)
for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. • Level 2 – inputs to the valuation
methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs
that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the
full term of the financial instrument. • Level 3 – one or more inputs to the valuation methodology
are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. A financial instrument’s
categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is
significant to the fair value measurement.

(a) At December 31, 2024 and 2023, included total U.S. GSE obligations of $ 120.1billion and $
78.5billion, respectively, which were mortgage-related.
(b) Physical commodities inventories are generally accounted for at the lower of cost or net
realizable value. “Net realizable value” is a term defined in U.S. GAAP as not exceeding fair value
less costs to sell (“transaction costs”). Transaction costs for the Firm’s physical commodities
inventories are either not applicable or immaterial to the value of the inventory. Therefore, net
realizable value approximates fair value for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories. When fair
value hedging has been applied (or when net realizable value is below cost), the carrying value of
physical commodities approximates fair value, because under fair value hedge accounting, the cost
basis is adjusted for changes in fair value. Refer to Note 5 for a further discussion of the Firm’s
hedge accounting relationships. To provide consistent fair value disclosure information, all physical
commodities inventories have been included in each period presented.

(c) Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the amount of identical
securities sold but not yet purchased (short positions).
(d) Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its
equivalent) as a practical expedient are not required to be classified in the fair value hierarchy.
At both December 31, 2024 and 2023, the fair values of these investments, which include certain hedge
funds, private equity funds, real estate and other funds, were $ 1.0billion, primarily reported in
other assets.
(e) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative
payables and the related cash collateral received and paid when a legally enforceable master netting
agreement exists. The level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the
netting benefit associated with cash collateral.

Level 3 valuations
The Firm has established well-structured processes for determining fair value, including for
instruments where fair value is estimated using significant unobservable inputs (level 3). Refer to
pages 181–185 of this Note for further information on the Firm’s valuation process and a detailed
discussion of the determination of fair value for individual financial instruments. Estimating fair
value requires the application of judgment. The type and level of judgment required is largely
dependent on the amount of observable market information available to the Firm. For instruments
valued using internally developed valuation models and other valuation techniques that use
significant unobservable inputs and are therefore classified within level 3 of the fair value
hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair value are more significant than those required when
estimating the fair value of instruments classified within levels 1 and 2. In arriving at an estimate
of fair value for an instrument within level 3, management must first determine the appropriate
valuation model or other valuation technique to use. Second, due to the lack of observability of
significant inputs, management must assess relevant empirical data in deriving valuation inputs
including transaction details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment speed, default rates,
volatilities, correlations, prices (such as commodity, equity or debt prices), valuations of
comparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. The following table presents the
Firm’s primary level 3 financial instruments, the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value
of those financial instruments, the significant unobservable inputs, the range of values for those
inputs and the weighted or arithmetic averages of such inputs. While the determination to classify an
instrument within level 3 is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair
value measurement, level 3 financial instruments typically include observable components (that is,
components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources) in addition to the
unobservable components. The level 1 and/or level 2 inputs are not included in the table. In
addition, the Firm manages the risk of the observable components of level 3 financial instruments
using securities and derivative positions that are classified within levels 1 or 2 of the fair value
hierarchy. The range of values presented in the table is representative of the highest and lowest
level input used to value the significant groups of instruments within a product/instrument
classification. Where provided, the weighted averages of the input values presented in the table are
calculated based on the fair value of the instruments that the input is being used to value. In the
Firm’s view, the input range, weighted and arithmetic average values do not reflect the degree of
input uncertainty or an assessment of the reasonableness of the Firm’s estimates and assumptions.
Rather, they reflect the characteristics of the various instruments held by the Firm and the relative
distribution of instruments within the range of characteristics. For example, two option contracts
may have similar levels of market risk exposure and valuation uncertainty, but may have significantly
different implied volatility levels because the option contracts have different underlyings, tenors,
or strike prices. The input range and weighted and arithmetic average values will therefore vary from
period-to-period and parameter-to-parameter based on the characteristics of the instruments held by
the Firm at each balance sheet date.

(a) The categories presented in the table have been aggregated based upon the product type, which may
differ from their classification on the Consolidated balance sheets. Furthermore, the inputs
presented for each valuation technique in the table are, in some cases, not applicable to every
instrument valued using the technique as the characteristics of the instruments can differ.
(b) Comprises U.S. GSE and government agency securities of $ 488million, nonagency securities of $
5million and non-trading loans of $ 368million.
(c) Comprises nonagency securities of $ 18million, trading loans of $ 65million and non-trading loans
of $ 1.3billion.
(d) Comprises trading loans of $ 1.0billion and non-trading loans of $ 707million.
(e) Long-term debt, short-term borrowings and deposits include structured notes issued by the Firm
that are financial instruments that typically contain embedded derivatives. The estimation of the
fair value of structured notes includes the derivative features embedded within the instrument. The
significant unobservable inputs are broadly consistent with those presented for derivative
receivables.
(f) Includes equity securities of $ 734million including $ 672million in Other assets, for which
quoted prices are not readily available and the fair value is generally based on internal valuation
techniques such as EBITDA multiples and comparable analysis. All other level 3 assets and liabilities
are insignificant both individually and in aggregate.
(g) Price is a significant unobservable input for certain instruments. When quoted market prices are
not readily available, reliance is generally placed on price-based internal valuation techniques. The
price input is expressed assuming a par value of $ 100.
(h) Forward equity price is expressed as a percentage of the current equity price.
(i) Amounts represent weighted averages except for derivative related inputs where arithmetic
averages are used.
 190 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K 
Changes in and ranges of unobservable inputs The following discussion provides a description of the
impact on a fair value measurement of a change in each unobservable input in isolation, and the
interrelationship between unobservable inputs, where relevant and significant. The impact of changes
in inputs may not be independent, as a change in one unobservable input may give rise to a change in
another unobservable input. Where relationships do exist between two unobservable inputs, those
relationships are discussed below. Relationships may also exist between observable and unobservable
inputs (for example, as observable interest rates rise, unobservable prepayment rates decline); such
relationships have not been included in the discussion below. In addition, for each of the individual
relationships described below, the inverse relationship would also generally apply. The following
discussion also provides a description of attributes of the underlying instruments and external
market factors that affect the range of inputs used in the valuation of the Firm’s positions. Yield –
The yield of an asset is the interest rate used to discount future cash flows in a discounted cash
flow calculation. An increase in the yield, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value
measurement. Credit spread – The credit spread is the amount of additional annualized return over the
market interest rate that a market participant would demand for taking exposure to the credit risk of
an instrument. The credit spread for an instrument forms part of the discount rate used in a
discounted cash flow calculation. Generally, an increase in the credit spread would result in a
decrease in a fair value measurement. The yield and the credit spread of a particular mortgage-backed
security primarily reflect the risk inherent in the instrument. The yield is also impacted by the
absolute level of the coupon paid by the instrument (which may not correspond directly to the level
of inherent risk). Therefore, the range of yield and credit spreads reflects the range of risk
inherent in various instruments owned by the Firm. The risk inherent in mortgage-backed securities is
driven by the subordination of the security being valued and the characteristics of the underlying
mortgages within the collateralized pool, including borrower FICO scores, LTV ratios for residential
mortgages and the nature of the property and/or any tenants for commercial mortgages. For corporate
debt securities, obligations of U.S. states and municipalities and other similar instruments, credit
spreads reflect the credit quality of the obligor and the tenor of the obligation. Prepayment speed –
The prepayment speed is a measure of the voluntary unscheduled principal repayments of a prepayable
obligation in a collateralized pool. Prepayment speeds generally decline as borrower delinquencies
rise. An increase in prepayment speeds, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value
measurement of assets valued at a premium to par and an increase in a fair value measurement of
assets valued at a discount to par. Prepayment speeds may vary from collateral pool to collateral
pool, and are driven by the type and location of the underlying borrower, and the remaining tenor of
the obligation as well as the level and type (e.g., fixed or floating) of interest rate being paid by
the borrower. Typically collateral pools with higher borrower credit quality have a higher prepayment
rate than those with lower borrower credit quality, all other factors being equal. Conditional
default rate – The conditional default rate is a measure of the reduction in the outstanding
collateral balance underlying a collateralized obligation as a result of defaults. While there is
typically no direct relationship between conditional default rates and prepayment speeds,
collateralized obligations for which the underlying collateral has high prepayment speeds will tend
to have lower conditional default rates. An increase in conditional default rates would generally be
accompanied by an increase in loss severity and an increase in credit spreads. An increase in the
conditional default rate, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement.
Conditional default rates reflect the quality of the collateral underlying a securitization and the
structure of the securitization itself. Based on the types of securities owned in the Firm’s market-
making portfolios, conditional default rates are most typically at the lower end of the range
presented. Loss severity – The loss severity (the inverse concept is the recovery rate) is the
expected amount of future realized losses resulting from the ultimate liquidation of a particular
loan, expressed as the net amount of loss relative to the outstanding loan balance. An increase in
loss severity is generally accompanied by an increase in conditional default rates. An increase in
the loss severity, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement. The loss
severity applied in valuing a mortgage-backed security depends on factors relating to the underlying
mortgages, including the LTV ratio, the nature of the lender’s lien on the property and other
instrument-specific factors.
 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K 191 
 Notes to consolidated financial statements 
Correlation – Correlation is a measure of the relationship between the movements of two variables.
Correlation is a pricing input for a derivative product where the payoff is driven by one or more
underlying risks. Correlation inputs are related to the type of derivative (e.g., interest rate,
credit, equity, foreign exchange and commodity) due to the nature of the underlying risks. When
parameters are positively correlated, an increase in one parameter will result in an increase in the
other parameter. When parameters are negatively correlated, an increase in one parameter will result
in a decrease in the other parameter. An increase in correlation can result in an increase or a
decrease in a fair value measurement. Given a short correlation position, an increase in correlation,
in isolation, would generally result in a decrease in a fair value measurement. The level of
correlation used in the valuation of derivatives with multiple underlying risks depends on a number
of factors including the nature of those risks. For example, the correlation between two credit risk
exposures would be different than that between two interest rate risk exposures. Similarly, the tenor
of the transaction may also impact the correlation input, as the relationship between the underlying
risks may be different over different time periods. Furthermore, correlation levels are dependent on
market conditions and could have a relatively wide range of levels within or across asset classes
over time, particularly in volatile market conditions. Volatility – Volatility is a measure of the
variability in possible returns for an instrument, parameter or market index given how much the
particular instrument, parameter or index changes in value over time. Volatility is a pricing input
for options, including equity options, commodity options, and interest rate options. Given a long
position in an option, an increase in volatility, in isolation, would generally result in an increase
in a fair value measurement. The level of volatility used in the valuation of a particular option-
based derivative depends on a number of factors, including the nature of the risk underlying the
option (e.g., the volatility of a particular equity security may be significantly different from that
of a particular commodity index), the tenor of the derivative as well as the strike price of the
option. Bermudan switch value – The switch value is the difference between the overall value of a
Bermudan swaption, which can be exercised at multiple points in time, and its most expensive European
swaption and reflects the additional value that the multiple exercise dates provide the holder.
Switch values are dependent on market conditions and can vary greatly depending on a number of
factors, such as the tenor of the underlying swap as well as the strike price of the option. An
increase in switch value, in isolation, would generally result in an increase in a fair value
measurement. Interest rate curve – The interest rate curve represents the relationship of interest
rates over differing tenors. The interest rate curve is used to set interest rate and foreign
exchange derivative cash flows and is also a pricing input used in the discounting of any derivative
cash flow. Forward price – The forward price is the price at which the buyer agrees to purchase the
asset underlying a forward contract on the predetermined future delivery date, and is such that the
value of the contract is zero at inception. The forward price is used as an input in the valuation of
certain derivatives and depends on a number of factors including interest rates, the current price of
the underlying asset, and the expected income to be received and costs to be incurred by the seller
as a result of holding that asset until the delivery date. An increase in the forward can result in
an increase or a decrease in a fair value measurement. Changes in level 3 recurring fair value
measurements The following tables include a rollforward of the Consolidated balance sheets amounts
(including changes in fair value) for financial instruments classified by the Firm within level 3 of
the fair value hierarchy for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. When a determination
is made to classify a financial instrument within level 3, the determination is based on the
significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement. However, level 3
financial instruments typically include, in addition to the unobservable or level 3 components,
observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external
sources); accordingly, the gains and losses in the table below include changes in fair value due in
part to observable factors that are part of the valuation methodology. The Firm risk-manages the
observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that
are classified within level 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2 risk
management instruments are not included below, the gains or losses in the following tables do not
reflect the effect of the Firm’s risk management activities related to such level 3 instruments.

 Notes to consolidated financial statements 
Credit and funding adjustments – derivatives Derivatives are generally valued using models that use
as their basis observable market parameters. These market parameters generally do not consider
factors such as counterparty nonperformance risk, the Firm’s own credit quality, and funding costs.
Therefore, it is generally necessary to make adjustments to the base estimate of fair value to
reflect these factors. CVA represents the adjustment, relative to the relevant benchmark interest
rate, necessary to reflect counterparty nonperformance risk. The Firm estimates CVA using a scenario
analysis to estimate the expected positive credit exposure across all of the Firm’s existing
positions with each counterparty, and then estimates losses based on the probability of default and
estimated recovery rate as a result of a counterparty credit event considering contractual factors
designed to mitigate the Firm’s credit exposure, such as collateral and legal rights of offset. The
key inputs to this methodology are (i) the probability of a default event occurring for each
counterparty, as derived from observed or estimated CDS spreads; and (ii) estimated recovery rates
implied by CDS spreads, adjusted to consider the differences in recovery rates as a derivative
creditor relative to those reflected in CDS spreads, which generally reflect senior unsecured
creditor risk. FVA represents the adjustment to reflect the impact of funding and is recognized where
there is evidence that a market participant in the principal market would incorporate it in a
transfer of the instrument. The Firm’s FVA framework, applied to uncollateralized (including
partially collateralized) over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivatives incorporates key inputs such as: (i)
the expected funding requirements arising from the Firm’s positions with each counterparty and
collateral arrangements; and (ii) the estimated market funding cost in the principal market which,
for derivative liabilities, considers the Firm’s credit risk (DVA). For collateralized derivatives,
the fair value is estimated by discounting expected future cash flows at the relevant overnight
indexed swap rate given the underlying collateral agreement with the counterparty, and therefore a
separate FVA is not necessary.
The following table provides the impact of
credit and funding adjustments on principal
transactions revenue in the respective periods,
excluding the effect of any associated hedging
activities. The FVA presented below includes the
impact of the Firm’s own credit quality on the
inception value of liabilities as well as the
impact of changes in the Firm’s own credit
quality over time.

Valuation adjustments on fair value option
elected liabilities
The valuation of the Firm’s liabilities for
which the fair value option has been elected
requires consideration of the Firm’s own credit
risk. DVA on fair value option elected
liabilities reflects changes (subsequent to the
issuance of the liability) in the Firm’s
probability of default and LGD, which are
estimated based on changes in the Firm’s credit
spread observed in the bond market. Realized
(gains)/losses due to DVA for fair value option
elected liabilities are reported in principal
transactions revenue. Unrealized (gains)/losses
are reported in OCI. Refer to page 196 in this

Equity securities without readily determinable fair values
The Firm measures certain equity securities without readily determinable fair values at cost less
impairment (if any), plus or minus observable price changes from an identical or similar investment
of the same issuer (i.e., measurement alternative), with such changes recognized in other income.
In its determination of the new carrying values upon observable price changes, the Firm may adjust
the prices if deemed necessary to arrive at the Firm’s estimated fair values. Such adjustments may
include adjustments to reflect the different rights and obligations of similar securities, and other
adjustments that are consistent with the Firm’s valuation techniques for private equity direct
investments.
The following table presents the carrying value of equity securities without readily determinable
fair values held as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, that are measured under the measurement
alternative and the related adjustments recorded during the periods presented for those securities
with observable price changes. These securities are included in the nonrecurring fair value tables
when applicable price changes are observable.

Included in other assets above is the Firm’s interest in approximately 18.6million Visa Class B-2
common shares ("Visa B-2 shares") and 37.2million Visa Class B common shares (“Visa B shares”)
reflected in the Firm's principal investment portfolio as of December 31, 2024 and 2023,
respectively.
The Visa B shares were redenominated to Visa Class B-1 common shares (“Visa B-1 shares”) on January
24, 2024. On April 8, 2024, Visa commenced an initial exchange offer for any and all outstanding Visa
B-1 shares. On May 6, 2024, the Firm announced that Visa had accepted the Firm’s tender of its
37.2million Visa B-1 shares in exchange for a combination of Visa B-2 shares and Visa Class C common
shares (“Visa C shares”), resulting in an initial gain of $ 8.0billion based on the fair value of the
Visa C shares. In addition, the second quarter of 2024 also reflected other Visa-related activity,
including the fair value changes of the Visa C shares and derivative instruments, as well as
dividends, resulting in the $ 7.9billion net gain on Visa shares in the quarter. As of September 30,
2024, the Firm had disposed of all of its Visa C shares through sales in the second and third
quarters of 2024 and through a $ 1.0billion contribution to the Firm’s Foundation in the second
quarter of 2024.
The Visa B-2 shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions and are convertible into Visa Class
A common shares (“Visa A shares”) at a specified conversion rate upon final resolution of certain
litigation matters involving Visa. The conversion rate of Visa B-2 shares to Visa A shares was
1.5430at December 31, 2024 and may be adjusted by Visa depending on developments related to the
litigation matters. The outcome of those litigation matters, and the effect that the resolution of
those matters may have on the conversion rate, is unknown. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2024,
there is significant uncertainty regarding when the transfer restrictions on Visa B-2 shares may be
terminated and what the final conversion rate for the Visa B-2 shares will be. As a result of these
considerations, as well as differences in voting rights, Visa B-2 shares are not considered to be
similar to Visa A shares, and are held at their nominal carryover basis.
Separately, in connection with sales of Visa B shares prior to 2024, the Firm has entered into
derivative instruments with the purchasers of the shares under which the Firm retains the risk
associated with changes in the conversion rate. Under the terms of the derivative instruments, the
Firm will (a) make or receive payments based on subsequent changes in the conversion rate and (b)
make periodic interest payments to the purchasers of the Visa B shares. The payments under the
derivative instruments will continue as long as the Visa B-2 shares associated with the previously
sold Visa B shares remain subject to transfer restrictions. The derivative instruments are accounted
for at fair value using a discounted cash flow methodology based upon the Firm’s estimate of the
timing and magnitude of final resolution of the litigation matters. The derivative instruments are
recorded in trading liabilities, and changes in fair value are recognized in other income. The
notional amount of shares associated with those derivative instruments has been adjusted as a result
of the Visa exchange offer. As of December 31, 2024, the Firm held derivative instruments associated
with 11.6million Visa B-2 shares related to Visa B share sales prior to 2024, which are all subject
to similar terms and conditions.

Additional disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments that are not carried on the
Consolidated balance sheets at fair value U.S. GAAP requires disclosure of the estimated fair value
of certain financial instruments, which are included in the following table. However, this table does
not include other items, such as nonfinancial assets, intangible assets, certain financial
instruments, and customer relationships. In the opinion of management, these items, in the aggregate,
add significant value to JPMorganChase. Financial instruments for which carrying value approximates
fair value Certain financial instruments that are not carried at fair value on the Consolidated
balance sheets are carried at amounts that approximate fair value, due to their short-term nature and
generally negligible credit risk. These instruments include cash and due from banks, deposits with
banks, federal funds sold, securities purchased under resale agreements and securities borrowed,
short-term receivables and accrued interest receivable, short-term borrowings, federal funds
purchased, securities loaned and sold under repurchase agreements, accounts payable, and accrued
liabilities. In addition, U.S. GAAP requires that the fair value of deposit liabilities with no
stated maturity (i.e., demand, savings and certain money market deposits) be equal to their carrying
value; recognition of the inherent funding value of these instruments is not permitted.
The following table presents, by fair value hierarchy classification, the carrying values and
estimated fair values at December 31, 2024 and 2023, of financial assets and liabilities, excluding
financial instruments that are carried at fair value on a recurring basis, and their classification
within the fair value hierarchy.

(a) Fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow model that incorporates the
characteristics of the underlying loans (including principal, contractual interest rate and
contractual fees) and other key inputs, including expected lifetime credit losses, interest rates,
prepayment rates, and primary origination or secondary market spreads. For certain loans, the fair
value is measured based on the value of the underlying collateral. Carrying value of the loan takes
into account the loan’s allowance for loan losses, which represents the loan’s expected credit losses
over its remaining expected life. The difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value
of a loan is generally attributable to changes in market interest rates, including credit spreads,
market liquidity premiums and other factors that affect the fair value of a loan but do not affect
its carrying value.

 Note 3 – Fair value option 
The fair value option provides an option to elect fair value for selected financial assets, financial
liabilities, unrecognized firm commitments, and written loan commitments. The Firm has elected to
measure certain instruments at fair value for several reasons including to mitigate income statement
volatility caused by the differences between the measurement basis of elected instruments (e.g.,
certain instruments that otherwise would be accounted for on an accrual basis) and the associated
risk management arrangements that are accounted for on a fair value basis, as well as to better
reflect those instruments that are managed on a fair value basis. The Firm’s election of fair value
includes the following instruments: • Loans purchased or originated as part of securitization
warehousing activity, subject to bifurcation accounting, or managed on a fair value basis, including
lending-related commitments • Certain securities financing agreements • Owned beneficial interests in
securitized financial assets that contain embedded credit derivatives, which would otherwise be
required to be separately accounted for as a derivative instrument • Structured notes and other
hybrid instruments, which are predominantly financial instruments that contain embedded derivatives,
that are issued or transacted as part of client-driven activities • Certain long-term beneficial
interests issued by CIB’s consolidated securitization trusts where the underlying assets are carried
at fair value

(a) Unrealized gains/(losses) due to instrument-specific credit risk (DVA) for liabilities for which
the fair value option has been elected are recorded in OCI, while realized gains/(losses) are
recorded in principal transactions revenue. Realized gains/(losses) due to instrument-specific credit
risk recorded in principal transactions revenue were not material for the years ended December 31,
2024, 2023 and 2022.
(b) Long-term debt measured at fair value predominantly relates to structured notes. Although the
risk associated with the structured notes is actively managed, the gains/(losses) reported in this
table do not include the income statement impact of the risk management instruments used to manage
such risk.
(c) Reported in mortgage fees and related income.
(d) Reported in other income.
(e) Changes in fair value exclude contractual interest, which is included in interest income and
interest expense for all instruments other than certain hybrid financial instruments in CIB. Refer to
Note 7 for further information regarding interest income and interest expense.
 204 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K 
Determination of instrument-specific credit risk for items for which the fair value option was
elected The following describes how the gains and losses that are attributable to changes in
instrument-specific credit risk, were determined. • Loans and lending-related commitments: For
floating-rate instruments, all changes in value are attributed to instrument-specific credit risk.
For fixed-rate instruments, an allocation of the changes in value for the period is made between
those changes in value that are interest rate-related and changes in value that are credit-related.
Allocations are generally based on an analysis of borrower-specific credit spread and recovery
information, where available, or benchmarking to similar entities or industries. • Long-term debt:
Changes in value attributable to instrument-specific credit risk were derived principally from
observable changes in the Firm’s credit spread as observed in the bond market. • Securities financing
agreements: Generally, for these types of agreements, there is a requirement that collateral be
maintained with a market value equal to or in excess of the principal amount loaned; as a result,
there would be no adjustment or an immaterial adjustment for instrument-specific credit risk related
to these agreements.

(a) These balances are excluded from nonaccrual loans as the loans are insured and/or guaranteed by
U.S. government agencies.
(b) There were noperforming loans that were ninety days or more past due as of December 31, 2024 and
2023.
(c) Includes loans insured and/or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies less than 90 days past due.
(d) Remaining contractual principal is not applicable to nonprincipal-protected structured notes and
long-term beneficial interests. Unlike principal-protected structured notes and long-term beneficial
interests, for which the Firm is obligated to return a stated amount of principal at maturity,
nonprincipal-protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests do not obligate the Firm
to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, but for structured notes to return an amount
based on the performance of an underlying variable or derivative feature embedded in the note.
However, investors are exposed to the credit risk of the Firm as issuer for both nonprincipal-
protected and principal-protected notes.
(e) Where the Firm issues principal-protected zero-coupon or discount notes, the balance reflects the
contractual principal payment at maturity or, if applicable, the contractual principal payment at the
Firm’s next call date.
At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the contractual amount of lending-related commitments for which the
fair value option was elected was $ 12.2billion and $ 9.7billion, respectively, with a corresponding
fair value of $ 50million and $ 97million, respectively. Refer to Note 28 for further information

 Note 4 – Credit risk concentrations 
Concentrations of credit risk arise when a number of clients, counterparties or customers are engaged
in similar business activities or activities in the same geographic region, or when they have similar
economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly
affected by changes in economic conditions. JPMorganChase regularly monitors various segments of its
credit portfolios to assess potential credit risk concentrations and to obtain additional collateral
when deemed necessary and permitted under the Firm’s agreements. Senior management is significantly
involved in the credit approval and review process, and risk levels are adjusted as needed to reflect
the Firm’s risk appetite. In the Firm’s consumer portfolio, concentrations are managed primarily by
product and by U.S. geographic region, with a key focus on trends and concentrations at the portfolio
level, where potential credit risk concentrations can be remedied through changes in underwriting
policies and portfolio guidelines. Refer to Note 12 for additional information on the geographic
composition of the Firm’s consumer loan portfolios. In the wholesale portfolio, credit risk
concentrations are evaluated primarily by industry and monitored regularly on both an aggregate
portfolio level and on an individual client or counterparty basis. The Firm’s wholesale exposure is
managed through loan syndications and participations, loan sales, securitizations, credit
derivatives, master netting agreements, collateral and other risk-reduction techniques. Refer to Note
12 for additional information on loans. The Firm does not believe that its exposure to any particular
loan product or industry segment results in a significant concentration of credit risk. Terms of loan
products and collateral coverage are included in the Firm’s assessment when extending credit and
establishing its allowance for credit losses. Refer to Note 13 for additional information on the
allowance for credit losses.

 208 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K 
 Note 5 – Derivative instruments 
Derivative contracts derive their value from underlying asset prices, indices, reference rates, other
inputs or a combination of these factors and may expose counterparties to risks and rewards of an
underlying asset or liability without having to initially invest in, own or exchange the asset or
liability. JPMorganChase makes markets in derivatives for clients and also uses derivatives to hedge
or manage its own risk exposures. Predominantly all of the Firm’s derivatives are entered into for
market-making or risk management purposes. Market-making derivatives The majority of the Firm’s
derivatives are entered into for market-making purposes. Clients use derivatives to mitigate or
modify interest rate, credit, foreign exchange, equity and commodity risks. The Firm actively manages
the risks from its exposure to these derivatives by entering into other derivative contracts or by
purchasing or selling other financial instruments that partially or fully offset the exposure from
client derivatives. Risk management derivatives The Firm manages certain market and credit risk
exposures using derivative instruments, including derivatives in hedge accounting relationships and
other derivatives that are used to manage risks associated with specified assets and liabilities. The
Firm generally uses interest rate derivatives to manage the risk associated with changes in interest
rates. Fixed-rate assets and liabilities appreciate or depreciate in market value as interest rates
change. Similarly, interest income and expense increase or decrease as a result of variable-rate
assets and liabilities resetting to current market rates, and as a result of the repayment and
subsequent origination or issuance of fixed-rate assets and liabilities at current market rates.
Gains and losses on the derivative instruments related to these assets and liabilities are expected
to substantially offset this variability. Foreign currency derivatives are used to manage the foreign
exchange risk associated with certain foreign currency–denominated (i.e., non-U.S. dollar) assets and
liabilities and forecasted transactions, as well as the Firm’s net investments in certain non-U.S.
subsidiaries or branches whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. As a result of
fluctuations in foreign currencies, the U.S. dollar–equivalent values of the foreign
currency–denominated assets and liabilities or the forecasted revenues or expenses increase or
decrease. Gains or losses on the derivative instruments related to these foreign currency–denominated
assets or liabilities, or forecasted transactions, are expected to substantially offset this
variability. Commodities derivatives are used to manage the price risk of certain commodities
inventories. Gains or losses on these derivative instruments are expected to substantially offset the
depreciation or appreciation of the related inventory. Credit derivatives are used to manage the
counterparty credit risk associated with loans and lending-related commitments. Credit derivatives
compensate the purchaser when the entity referenced in the contract experiences a credit event, such
as bankruptcy or a failure to pay an obligation when due. Credit derivatives primarily consist of
CDS. Refer to the Credit derivatives section on pages 222–224 of this Note for a further discussion
of credit derivatives. Refer to the risk management derivatives gains and losses table on page 221
and the hedge accounting gains and losses tables on pages 218–221 of this Note for more information
about risk management derivatives. Derivative counterparties and settlement types The Firm enters
into OTC derivatives, which are negotiated and settled bilaterally with the derivative counterparty.
The Firm also enters into, as principal, certain ETD such as futures and options, and OTC-cleared
derivative contracts with CCPs. ETD contracts are generally standardized contracts traded on an
exchange and cleared by the CCP, which is the Firm’s counterparty from the inception of the
transactions. OTC-cleared derivatives are traded on a bilateral basis and then novated to the CCP for
clearing. Derivative clearing services The Firm provides clearing services for clients in which the
Firm acts as a clearing member at certain exchanges and clearing houses. The Firm does not reflect
the clients’ derivative contracts in its Consolidated Financial Statements. Refer to Note 28 for
further information on the Firm’s clearing services. Accounting for derivatives All free-standing
derivatives that the Firm executes for its own account are required to be recorded on the
Consolidated balance sheets at fair value. As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm nets derivative
assets and liabilities, and the related cash collateral receivables and payables, when a legally
enforceable master netting agreement exists between the Firm and the derivative counterparty. Refer
to Note 1 for further discussion of the offsetting of assets and liabilities. The accounting for
changes in value of a derivative depends on whether or not the transaction has been designated and
qualifies for hedge accounting. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges are reported and
measured at fair value through earnings. The tabular disclosures on pages 213–221 of this Note
provide additional information on the amount of, and reporting for, derivative assets, liabilities,
gains and losses. Refer to Notes 2 and 3 for a further discussion of derivatives embedded in
structured notes.
 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K 209 
 Notes to consolidated financial statements 
Derivatives designated as hedges The Firm applies hedge accounting to certain derivatives executed
for risk management purposes – generally interest rate, foreign exchange and commodity derivatives.
However, JPMorganChase does not seek to apply hedge accounting to all of the derivatives associated
with the Firm’s risk management activities. For example, the Firm does not apply hedge accounting to
purchased CDS used to manage the credit risk of loans and lending-related commitments, because of the
difficulties in qualifying such contracts as hedges. For the same reason, the Firm does not apply
hedge accounting to certain interest rate, foreign exchange, and commodity derivatives used for risk
management purposes. To qualify for hedge accounting, a derivative must be highly effective at
reducing the risk associated with the exposure being hedged. In addition, for a derivative to be
designated as a hedge, the risk management objective and strategy must be documented. Hedge
documentation must identify the derivative hedging instrument, the asset or liability or forecasted
transaction and type of risk to be hedged, and how the effectiveness of the derivative is assessed
prospectively and retrospectively. To assess effectiveness, the Firm uses statistical methods such as
regression analysis, nonstatistical methods such as dollar-value comparisons of the change in the
fair value of the derivative to the change in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item, and
qualitative comparisons of critical terms and the evaluation of any changes in those terms. The
extent to which a derivative has been, and is expected to continue to be, highly effective at
offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item must be assessed and documented
at least quarterly. If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective at hedging the
designated exposure, hedge accounting is discontinued. There are three types of hedge accounting
designations: fair value hedges, cash flow hedges and net investment hedges. JPMorganChase uses fair
value hedges primarily to hedge fixed-rate long-term debt, AFS securities and certain commodities
inventories. For qualifying fair value hedges, the changes in the fair value of the derivative, and
in the value of the hedged item for the risk being hedged, are recognized in earnings. Certain
amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recorded in OCI and recognized in earnings
over the life of the derivative. If the hedge relationship is terminated, then the adjustment to the
hedged item continues to be reported as part of the basis of the hedged item and, for interest-
bearing financial instruments, is amortized to earnings as a yield adjustment. Derivative amounts
affecting earnings are recognized consistent with the classification of the hedged item – primarily
net interest income and principal transactions revenue. The Firm employs the portfolio layer method
to manage the interest rate risk of portfolios of fixed-rate assets. Throughout the life of the open
hedge, basis adjustments are maintained at the portfolio level and are only allocated to individual
assets under certain circumstances. These include instances where the portfolio amount falls below
the hedged layer amounts, or in cases of voluntary de-designation. JPMorganChase uses cash flow
hedges primarily to hedge the exposure to variability in forecasted cash flows from floating-rate
assets and liabilities and foreign currency–denominated revenue and expense. For qualifying cash flow
hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in OCI and recognized in earnings as
the hedged item affects earnings. Derivative amounts affecting earnings are recognized consistent
with the classification of the hedged item – primarily noninterest revenue, net interest income and
compensation expense. If the hedge relationship is terminated, then the change in value of the
derivative recorded in AOCI is recognized in earnings when the cash flows that were hedged affect
earnings. For hedge relationships that are discontinued because a forecasted transaction is expected
to not occur according to the original hedge forecast, any related derivative values recorded in AOCI
are immediately recognized in earnings. JPMorganChase uses net investment hedges to protect the value
of the Firm’s net investments in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries or branches whose functional
currencies are not the U.S. dollar. For qualifying net investment hedges, changes in the fair value
of the derivatives due to changes in spot foreign exchange rates are recorded in OCI as translation
adjustments. Amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recorded directly in earnings.

 Notes to consolidated financial statements 
Derivatives netting
The following tables present, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, gross and net derivative receivables
and payables by contract and settlement type. Derivative receivables and payables, as well as the
related cash collateral from the same counterparty, have been netted on the Consolidated balance
sheets where the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting
agreement. Where such a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, amounts are not
eligible for netting on the Consolidated balance sheets, and those derivative receivables and
payables are shown separately in the tables.
In addition to the cash collateral received and transferred that is presented on a net basis with
derivative receivables and payables, the Firm receives and transfers additional collateral (financial
instruments and cash). These amounts mitigate counterparty credit risk associated with the Firm’s
derivative instruments, but are not eligible for net presentation:
• collateral that consists of liquid securities and other cash collateral held at third-party
custodians, which are shown separately as "Collateral not nettable on the Consolidated balance
sheets" in the tables, up to the fair value exposure amount. For the purpose of this disclosure, the
definition of liquid securities is consistent with the definition of high quality liquid assets as
defined in the LCR rule;
• the amount of collateral held or transferred that exceeds the fair value exposure at the individual
counterparty level, as of the date presented, which is excluded from the tables; and
• collateral held or transferred that relates to derivative receivables or payables where an
appropriate legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained with respect to the master netting
agreement, which is excluded from the tables.

(b) Includes liquid securities and other cash collateral held at third-party custodians related to
derivative instruments where an appropriate legal opinion has been obtained. For some counterparties,
the collateral amounts of financial instruments may exceed the derivative receivables and derivative
payables balances. Where this is the case, the total amount reported is limited to the net derivative

collateral relates to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative instruments.
 216 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K 
Liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features
In addition to the specific market risks introduced by each derivative contract type, derivatives
expose JPMorganChase to credit risk — the risk that derivative counterparties may fail to meet their
payment obligations under the derivative contracts and the collateral, if any, held by the Firm
proves to be of insufficient value to cover the payment obligation. It is the policy of JPMorganChase
to actively pursue, where possible, the use of legally enforceable master netting arrangements and
collateral agreements to mitigate derivative counterparty credit risk inherent in derivative
receivables.
While derivative receivables expose the Firm to credit risk, derivative payables expose the Firm to
liquidity risk, as the derivative contracts typically require the Firm to post cash or securities
collateral with counterparties as the fair value of the contracts moves in the counterparties’ favor
or upon specified downgrades in the Firm’s and its subsidiaries’ respective credit ratings. Certain
derivative contracts also provide for termination of the contract, generally upon a downgrade of
either the Firm or the counterparty, at the fair value of the derivative contracts. The following
table shows the aggregate fair value of net derivative payables related to OTC and OTC-cleared
derivatives that contain contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a
ratings downgrade, and the associated collateral the Firm has posted in the normal course of
business, at December 31, 2024 and 2023.

The following table shows the impact of a single-notch and two-notch downgrade of the long-term

at December 31, 2024 and 2023, related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative contracts with contingent
collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade. Derivatives
contracts generally require additional collateral to be posted or terminations to be triggered when
the predefined rating threshold is breached. A downgrade by a single rating agency that does not
result in a rating lower than a preexisting corresponding rating provided by another major rating
agency will generally not result in additional collateral (except in certain instances in which
additional initial margin may be required upon a ratings downgrade), nor in termination payment
requirements. The liquidity impact in the table is calculated based upon a downgrade below the lowest
current rating of the rating agencies referred to in the derivative contract.

Derivatives executed in contemplation of a sale of the underlying financial asset
In certain instances the Firm enters into transactions in which it transfers financial assets but
maintains the economic exposure to the transferred assets by entering into a derivative with the same
counterparty in contemplation of the initial transfer. The Firm generally accounts for such transfers
as collateralized financing transactions as described in Note 11, but in limited circumstances they
may qualify to be accounted for as a sale and a derivative under U.S. GAAP. The amount of such
transfers accounted for as a sale where the associated derivative was outstanding was not material at
December 31, 2024 and 2023.

(a) Primarily consists of hedges of the benchmark (e.g., Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”))
interest rate risk of fixed-rate long-term debt and AFS securities. Gains and losses were recorded in
net interest income.
(b) Includes the amortization of income/expense associated with the inception hedge accounting
adjustment applied to the hedged item. Excludes the accrual of interest on interest rate swaps and
the related hedged items.
(c) Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of long-term debt and AFS securities
for changes in spot foreign currency rates. Gains and losses related to the derivatives and the
hedged items due to changes in foreign currency rates and the income statement impact of excluded
components were recorded primarily in principal transactions revenue and net interest income.
(d) Consists of overall fair value hedges of physical commodities inventories that are generally
carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value (net realizable value approximates fair value).
Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue.
(e) The assessment of hedge effectiveness excludes certain components of the changes in fair values
of the derivatives and hedged items such as forward points on foreign exchange forward contracts,
time values and cross-currency basis spreads. Excluded components may impact earnings either through
amortization of the initial amount over the life of the derivative or through fair value changes
recognized in the current period.
(f) Represents the change in value of amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness under the
amortization approach, predominantly cross-currency basis spreads. The amount excluded at inception
of the hedge is recognized in earnings over the life of the derivative.

(a) Excludes physical commodities with a carrying value of $ 6.2billion and $ 5.6billion at December
31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, to which the Firm applies fair value hedge accounting. As a result
of the application of hedge accounting, these inventories are carried at fair value, thus recognizing
unrealized gains and losses in current periods. Since the Firm exits these positions at fair value,
there is no incremental impact to net income in future periods.
(b) Excludes hedged items where only foreign currency risk is the designated hedged risk, as basis
adjustments related to foreign currency hedges will not reverse through the income statement in
future periods. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the carrying amount excluded for AFS securities was $
28.7billion and $ 19.3billion, respectively. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the carrying amount
excluded for long-term debt was $ 518million and zero, respectively.
(c) Carrying amount represents the amortized cost, net of allowance if applicable. At December 31,
2024 and December 31, 2023, the amortized cost of the portfolio layer method closed portfolios was $
72.8billion and $ 83.9billion, of which $ 41.2billion and $ 68.0billion was designated as hedged,
respectively. The amount designated as hedged is the sum of the notional amounts of all outstanding
layers in each portfolio, which includes both spot starting and forward starting layers. At December
31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the cumulative amount of basis adjustments was $( 1.7) billion and $(
165) million, which is comprised of $( 1.2) billion and $ 73million for active hedging relationships,

to Note 10 for additional information.
(d) Positive (negative) amounts related to assets represent cumulative fair value hedge basis
adjustments that will reduce (increase) net interest income in future periods. Positive (negative)
amounts related to liabilities represent cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that will

The Firm did not experience any forecasted transactions that failed to occur for the years ended
2024, 2023 and 2022.
Over the next 12 months, the Firm expects that approximately $( 1.6) billion (after-tax) of net
losses recorded in AOCI at December 31, 2024, related to cash flow hedges will be recognized in
income. For cash flow hedges that have been terminated, the maximum length of time over which the
derivative results recorded in AOCI will be recognized in earnings is approximately seven years,
corresponding to the timing of the originally hedged forecasted cash flows. For open cash flow
hedges, the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is approximately
seven years. The Firm’s longer-dated forecasted transactions relate to core lending and borrowing
activities.

 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K 221 
 Notes to consolidated financial statements 
Credit derivatives Credit derivatives are financial instruments whose value is derived from the
credit risk associated with the debt of a third-party issuer (the reference entity) and which allow
one party (the protection purchaser) to transfer that risk to another party (the protection seller).
Credit derivatives expose the protection purchaser to the creditworthiness of the protection seller,
as the protection seller is required to make payments under the contract when the reference entity
experiences a credit event, such as a bankruptcy, a failure to pay its obligation or a restructuring.
The seller of credit protection receives a premium for providing protection but has the risk that the
underlying instrument referenced in the contract will be subject to a credit event. The Firm is both
a purchaser and seller of protection in the credit derivatives market and uses these derivatives for
two primary purposes. First, in its capacity as a market-maker, the Firm actively manages a portfolio
of credit derivatives by purchasing and selling credit protection, predominantly on corporate debt
obligations, to meet the needs of customers. Second, as an end-user, the Firm uses credit derivatives
to manage credit risk associated with lending exposures (loans and unfunded commitments) in its
wholesale and consumer businesses and derivatives counterparty exposures in its wholesale businesses,
and to manage the credit risk arising from certain financial instruments in the Firm’s market-making
businesses. Following is a summary of various types of credit derivatives. Credit default swaps
Credit derivatives may reference the credit of either a single reference entity (“single-name”),
broad-based index or portfolio. The Firm purchases and sells protection on both single- name and
index-reference obligations. Single-name CDS and index CDS contracts are either OTC or OTC-cleared
derivative contracts. Single-name CDS are used to manage the default risk of a single reference
entity, while index CDS contracts are used to manage the credit risk associated with the broader
credit markets or credit market segments. Like the S&P 500 and other market indices, a CDS index
consists of a portfolio of CDS across many reference entities. New series of CDS indices are
periodically established with a new underlying portfolio of reference entities to reflect changes in
the credit markets. If one of the reference entities in the index experiences a credit event, then
the reference entity that defaulted is removed from the index. CDS can also be referenced against
specific portfolios of reference names or against customized exposure levels: for example, to provide
protection against the first $ 1million of realized credit losses in a $ 10million portfolio of
exposure. Such structures are commonly known as tranche CDS. For both single-name CDS contracts and
index CDS contracts, upon the occurrence of a credit event, under the terms of a CDS contract neither
party to the CDS contract has recourse to the reference entity. The protection purchaser has recourse
to the protection seller for the difference between the face value of the CDS contract and the fair
value of the reference obligation at settlement of the credit derivative contract, also known as the
recovery value. The protection purchaser does not need to hold the debt instrument of the underlying
reference entity in order to receive amounts due under the CDS contract when a credit event occurs.
Credit-related notes A credit-related note is a funded derivative with a credit risk component where
the issuer of the credit-related note purchases from the note investor credit protection on a
reference entity or an index. Under the contract, the investor pays the issuer the par value of the
note at the inception of the transaction, and in return, the issuer makes periodic payments to the
investor, based on the credit risk of the referenced entity. The issuer also repays the investor the
par value of the note at maturity unless the reference entity (or one of the entities that makes up a
reference index) experiences a specified credit event. If a credit event occurs, the issuer is not
obligated to repay the par value of the note, but rather, the issuer pays the investor the difference
between the par value of the note and the fair value of the defaulted reference obligation at the
time of settlement. Neither party to the credit-related note has recourse to the defaulting reference
entity. The following tables present a summary of the notional amounts of credit derivatives and
credit-related notes the Firm sold and purchased as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. Upon a credit
event, the Firm as a seller of protection would typically pay out a percentage of the full notional
amount of net protection sold, as the amount actually required to be paid on the contracts takes into
account the recovery value of the reference obligation at the time of settlement. The Firm manages
the credit risk on contracts to sell protection by purchasing protection with identical or similar
underlying reference entities. Other purchased protection referenced in the following tables includes
credit derivatives bought on related, but not identical, reference positions (including indices,
portfolio coverage and other reference points) as well as protection purchased by CIB through credit-
related notes. Other purchased protection also includes credit protection against certain loans in
the retained lending portfolio through the issuance of credit derivatives and credit-related notes.
 222 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K 
The Firm does not use notional amounts of credit derivatives as the primary measure of risk
management for such derivatives, because the notional amount does not take into account the
probability of the occurrence of a credit event, the recovery value of the reference obligation, or
related cash instruments and economic hedges, each of which reduces, in the Firm’s view, the risks
associated with such derivatives.

Note 6 – Noninterest revenue and noninterest
expense
Noninterest revenue The Firm records noninterest
revenue from certain contracts with customers in
investment banking fees, deposit-related fees,
asset management fees, commissions and other
fees, and components of card income. The related
contracts are often terminable on demand and the
Firm has no remaining obligation to deliver
future services. For arrangements with a fixed
term, the Firm may commit to deliver services in
the future. Revenue associated with these
remaining performance obligations typically
depends on the occurrence of future events or
underlying asset values, and is not recognized
until the outcome of those events or values are
known. Investment banking fees This revenue
category includes debt and equity underwriting
and advisory fees. As an underwriter, the Firm
helps clients raise capital via public offering
and private placement of various types of debt
and equity instruments. Underwriting fees are
primarily based on the issuance price and
quantity of the underlying instruments, and are
recognized as revenue typically upon execution
of the client’s transaction. The Firm also
manages and syndicates loan arrangements. Credit
arrangement and syndication fees, included
within debt underwriting fees, are recorded as
revenue after satisfying certain retention,
timing and yield criteria. The Firm also
provides advisory services by assisting its
clients with mergers and acquisitions,
divestitures, restructuring and other complex
transactions. Advisory fees are recognized as
revenue typically upon execution of the client’s
transaction.
The following table presents the components of
investment banking fees.

Investment banking fees are earned primarily by CIB.
Principal transactions Principal transactions revenue is driven by many factors, including: • the
bid-offer spread, which is the difference between the price at which a market participant is willing
and able to sell an instrument to the Firm and the price at which another market participant is
willing and able to buy it from the Firm, and vice versa; and • realized and unrealized gains and
losses on financial instruments and commodities transactions, including those accounted for under the
fair value option, primarily used in client-driven market-making activities. – Realized gains and
losses result from the sale of instruments, closing out or termination of transactions, or interim
cash payments. – Unrealized gains and losses result from changes in valuation. In connection with its
client-driven market-making activities, the Firm transacts in debt and equity instruments,
derivatives and commodities, including physical commodities inventories and financial instruments
that reference commodities. Principal transactions revenue also includes realized and unrealized
gains and losses related to: • derivatives designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships,
primarily fair value hedges of commodity and foreign exchange risk; • derivatives used for specific
risk management purposes, primarily to mitigate credit, foreign exchange and interest rate risks.
Refer to Note 5 for further information on the income statement classification of gains and losses
from derivatives activities. In the financial commodity markets, the Firm transacts in OTC
derivatives (e.g., swaps, forwards, options) and ETD that reference a wide range of underlying
commodities. In the physical commodity markets, the Firm primarily purchases and sells precious and
base metals, natural gas, and may hold other commodities inventories under financing and other
arrangements with clients. The following table presents all realized and unrealized gains and losses
recorded in principal transactions revenue. This table excludes interest income and interest expense
on trading assets and liabilities, which are an integral part of the overall performance of the
Firm’s client-driven market-making activities in CIB and fund deployment activities in Treasury and
CIO. Refer to Note 7 for further information on interest income and interest expense. Trading revenue
is presented primarily by instrument type. The Firm’s client-driven market-making businesses
generally utilize a variety of instrument

commitments were generally short term. Refer to
Note 34 for additional information.
Lending- and deposit-related fees are earned by
CCB, CIB and AWM.
Asset management fees Investment management fees
include fees associated with assets the Firm
manages on behalf of its clients, including
investors in Firm-sponsored funds and owners of
separately managed investment accounts.
Management fees are typically based on the value
of assets under management and are collected and
recognized at the end of each period over which
the management services are provided and the
value of the managed assets is known. The Firm
also receives performance-based management fees,
which are earned based on exceeding certain
benchmarks or other performance targets and are
accrued and recognized when the probability of
reversal is remote, typically at the end of the
related billing period. All other asset
management fees include commissions earned on
the sales or distribution of mutual funds to
clients. These fees are recorded as revenue at
the time the service is rendered or, in the case
of certain distribution fees, based on the
underlying fund’s asset value or investor
redemption activity.

products. Brokerage commissions represents
commissions earned when the Firm acts as a
broker, by facilitating its clients’ purchases
and sales of securities and other financial
instruments. Brokerage commissions are collected
and recognized as revenue upon occurrence of the
client transaction. The Firm reports certain
costs paid to third-party clearing houses and
exchanges net against commission revenue.
Administration fees predominantly include fees
for custody, funds services, securities lending
and securities clearance. These fees are
recorded as revenue over the period in which the
related service is provided.

 All other commissions and fees(a) 1,885 1,706 1,402 
 Total commissions and other fees $ 7,530 $ 6,836 $ 6,581 
(a) Includes annuity sales commissions,
depositary receipt-related service fees and
travel-related sales commissions, as well as
other service fees, which are recognized as
revenue when the services are rendered.
Commissions and other fees are earned primarily
by CIB, CCB and AWM. Mortgage fees and related
income This revenue category reflects CCB’s Home
Lending production and net mortgage servicing
revenue. Production revenue includes fees and
income recognized as earned on mortgage loans
originated with the intent to sell, and the
impact of risk management activities associated
with the mortgage pipeline and warehouse loans.
Production revenue also includes gains and
losses on sales and lower of cost or fair value
adjustments on mortgage loans held-for-sale
(excluding certain repurchased loans insured by
U.S. government agencies), and changes in the
fair value of financial instruments measured
under the fair value option. Net mortgage
servicing revenue includes operating revenue
earned from servicing third-party mortgage
loans, which is recognized over the period in
which the service is provided; changes in the
fair value of MSRs; the impact of risk
management activities associated with MSRs; and
gains and losses on securitization of excess
mortgage servicing. Net mortgage servicing
revenue also includes gains and losses on sales
and lower of cost or fair value adjustments of
certain repurchased loans insured by U.S.
government agencies. Refer to Note 15 for
further information on risk management
activities and MSRs. Net interest income from
mortgage loans is recorded in interest income.
Card income This revenue category includes
interchange and other income from credit and
debit card transactions; and fees earned from
processing card transactions for merchants, both
of which are recognized when purchases are made
by a cardholder and presented net of certain
transaction-related costs. Card income also
includes account origination costs and annual
fees, which are deferred and recognized on a
straight-line basis over a 12-month period.
Certain credit card products offer the
cardholder the ability to earn points based on
account activity, which the cardholder can
choose to redeem for cash and non-cash rewards.
The cost to the Firm related to these
proprietary rewards programs varies based on
multiple factors including the terms and
conditions of the rewards programs, cardholder
activity, cardholder reward redemption rates and
cardholder reward selections. The Firm maintains
a liability for its obligations under its
rewards programs and reports the current-period
cost as a reduction of card income. Credit card
revenue sharing agreements The Firm has
contractual agreements with numerous co-brand
partners that grant the Firm exclusive rights to
issue co-branded credit card products and market
them to the customers of such partners. These
partners endorse the co-brand credit card
programs and provide their customer or member
lists to the Firm. The partners may also conduct
marketing activities and provide rewards
redeemable under their own loyalty programs that
the Firm will grant to co-brand credit
cardholders based on account activity. The terms
of these agreements generally range from fiveto
ten years. The Firm typically makes payments to
the co-brand credit card partners based on the
cost of partners’ marketing activities and
loyalty program rewards provided to credit
cardholders, new account originations and sales
volumes. Payments to partners based on marketing
efforts undertaken by the partners are expensed
by the Firm as incurred and reported as
marketing expense. Payments for partner loyalty
program rewards are reported as a reduction of
card income when incurred. Payments to partners
based on new credit card account originations
are accounted for as direct loan origination
costs and are deferred and recognized as a
reduction of card income on a straight-line
basis over a 12-month period. Payments to
partners based on sales volumes are reported as
a reduction of card income when the related
interchange income is earned.

Other income This revenue category includes
operating lease income, as well as losses

 Note 7 – Interest income and interest expense 
Interest income and interest expense are recorded in the Consolidated statements of income and
classified based on the nature of the underlying asset or liability. Interest income and interest
expense includes the current-period interest accruals for financial instruments measured at fair
value, except for derivatives and certain financial instruments containing embedded derivatives; for
those instruments, all changes in fair value including any interest elements, are primarily reported
in principal transactions revenue. For financial instruments that are not measured at fair value, the
related interest is included within interest income or interest expense, as applicable. Interest
income and interest expense also includes the effect of derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting
where applicable. Interest income on loans and securities include the amortization and accretion of
purchase premiums and discounts, as well as net deferred fees and costs on loans. These amounts are
deferred in loans and investment securities, respectively, and recognized on a level-yield basis.
Refer to Notes 5, 10, 11, 12, and 20 for further information on accounting for interest income and
interest expense related to hedge accounting, investment securities, securities financing activities
(i.e., securities purchased or sold under resale or repurchase agreements; securities borrowed; and
securities loaned), loans and long-term debt, respectively.

 Note 8 – Pension and other postretirement 
employee benefit plans
The Firm has various defined benefit pension plans and OPEB plans that provide benefits to its
employees in the U.S. and certain non-U.S. locations. Substantially all the defined benefit pension
plans are closed to new participants. The principal defined benefit pension plan in the U.S., which
covered substantially all U.S. employees, was closed to new participants and frozen for existing
participants on January 1, 2020, (and January 1, 2019 for new hires on or after December 2, 2017).
Interest credits continue to accrue to participants’ accounts based on their accumulated balances.
The Firm maintains funded and unfunded postretirement benefit plans that provide medical and life
insurance for certain eligible employees and retirees as well as their dependents covered under these
programs. None of these plans have a material impact on the Firm’s Consolidated Financial Statements.
The Firm also provides a qualified defined contribution plan in the U.S. and maintains other similar
arrangements in certain non-U.S. locations. The most significant of these plans is the JPMorgan Chase
401(k) Savings Plan (“the 401(k) Savings Plan”), which covers substantially all U.S. employees.
Employees can contribute to the 401(k) Savings Plan on a pretax and/or Roth 401(k) after-tax basis.
The Firm makes annual matching and pay credit contributions to the 401(k) Savings Plan on behalf of
eligible participants.
The following table presents the pretax benefit obligations, plan assets, the net funded status, and
the amounts recorded in AOCI on the Consolidated balance sheets for the Firm’s significant defined
benefit pension and OPEB plans.

 income/(loss) 
The weighted-average discount rate used to value the benefit obligations as of December 31, 2024 and
2023, was 5.49% and 5.16%, respectively.
Gains and losses
Gains or losses resulting from changes in the benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets
are recorded in OCI. Amortization of net gains or losses are recognized as part of the net periodic
benefit cost over subsequent periods, if, as of the beginning of the year, the net gain or loss
exceeds 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of the plan assets.
Amortization is generally over the average expected remaining lifetime of plan participants, given
the frozen status of most plans. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the net loss was attributable
to lower than expected returns on plan assets, partially offset by projected benefit obligation net
gains primarily related to changes in the discount rate. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the
net gain was attributable to market-driven increases in the fair value of plan assets, partially
offset by changes in the discount rate and interest crediting rate.
The following table presents the net periodic benefit costs reported in the Consolidated statements
of income for the Firm’s defined benefit pension, defined contribution and OPEB plans, and in other
comprehensive income for the defined benefit pension and OPEB plans.

The following table presents the weighted-average actuarial assumptions used to determine the net
periodic benefit costs for the defined benefit pension and OPEB plans.
 Year ended December 31, 2024 2023 2022 
 ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── 
 Discount rate 5.16 % 5.14 % 2.54 % 
 Expected long-term rate of return on 6.15 % 5.74 % 3.68 % 
 plan assets 
Plan assumptions The Firm’s expected long-term
rate of return is a blended weighted average, by
asset allocation of the projected long-term
returns for the various asset classes, taking
into consideration local market conditions and
the specific allocation of plan assets. Returns
on asset classes are developed using a forward-
looking approach and are not strictly based on
historical returns, with consideration given to
current market conditions and the portfolio mix
of each plan. The discount rates used in
determining the benefit obligations are
generally provided by the Firm’s actuaries, with
the Firm’s principal defined benefit pension
plan using a rate that was selected by reference
to the yields on portfolios of bonds with
maturity dates and coupons that closely match
the plan’s projected annual cash flows.
Investment strategy and asset allocation The
assets of the Firm’s defined benefit pension
plans are held in various trusts and are
invested in well-diversified portfolios of
equity and fixed income securities, cash and
cash equivalents, and alternative investments.
The Firm regularly reviews the asset allocations
and asset managers, as well as other factors
that could impact the portfolios, which are
rebalanced when deemed necessary. As of December
31, 2024, the approved asset allocation ranges
by asset class for the Firm’s principal defined
benefit plan are 41- 100% debt securities, 0-
40% equity securities, 0- 1% real estate, and 0-
8% alternatives. Assets held by the Firm’s
defined benefit pension and OPEB plans do not
include securities issued by JPMorganChase or
its affiliates, except through indirect
exposures through investments in exchange traded
funds, mutual funds and collective investment
funds managed by third-parties. The defined
benefit pension and OPEB plans hold investments
that are sponsored or managed by affiliates of
JPMorganChase in the amount of $ 1.8billion as
of both December 31, 2024 and 2023.

 Note 9 – Employee share-based incentives 
Employee share-based awards In 2024, 2023 and 2022, JPMorganChase granted long-term share-based
awards to certain employees under its LTIP, as amended and restated effective May 18, 2021, and
subsequently amended effective May 21, 2024. Under the terms of the LTIP, as of December 31, 2024,
81million shares of common stock were available for issuance through May 2028. The LTIP is the only
active plan under which the Firm is currently granting share-based incentive awards. In the following
discussion, the LTIP constitutes the Firm’s share-based incentive plans. RSUs are awarded at no cost
to the recipient upon their grant. Generally, RSUs are granted annually and vest at a rate of 50%
after two yearsand 50% after three yearsand are converted into shares of common stock as of the
vesting date. In addition, RSUs typically include full-career eligibility provisions, which allow
employees to continue to vest upon voluntary termination based on age and/or service-related
requirements, subject to post-employment and other restrictions. All RSU awards are subject to
forfeiture until vested and contain clawback provisions that may result in cancellation under certain
specified circumstances. Predominantly all RSUs entitle the recipient to receive cash payments
equivalent to any dividends paid on the underlying common stock during the period the RSUs are
outstanding. Performance share units (“PSUs”) are granted annually, and approved by the Firm’s Board
of Directors, to members of the Firm’s Operating Committee under the variable compensation program.
PSUs are subject to the Firm’s achievement of specified performance criteria over a three-yearperiod.
The number of awards that vest can range from zeroto 150% of the grant amount. In addition, dividends
that accrue during the vesting period are reinvested in dividend equivalent share units. PSUs and the
related dividend equivalent share units are converted into shares of common stock after vesting. Once
the PSUs and dividend equivalent share units have vested, the shares of common stock that are
delivered, after applicable tax withholding, must be retained for an additional holding period, for a
total combined vesting and holding period of approximately fiveto eight yearsfrom the grant date
depending on regulations in certain countries. Under the LTI Plans, stock appreciation rights
(“SARs”) were granted with an exercise price equal to the fair value of JPMorganChase’s common stock
on the grant date. SARs expire ten yearsafter the grant date. There were nogrants of SARs in 2024,
2023 or 2022. The Firm separately recognizes compensation expense for each tranche of each award, net
of estimated forfeitures, as if it were a separate award with its own vesting date. Generally, for
each tranche granted, compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis from the grant date
until the vesting date of the respective tranche, provided that the employees will not become full-
career eligible during the vesting period. For awards with full-career eligibility provisions and
awards granted with no future substantive service requirement, the Firm accrues the estimated value
of awards expected to be awarded to employees as of the grant date without giving consideration to
the impact of post-employment restrictions. For each tranche granted to employees who will become
full-career eligible during the vesting period, compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line
basis from the grant date until the earlier of the employee’s full-career eligibility date or the
vesting date of the respective tranche. The Firm’s policy for issuing shares upon settlement of
employee share-based incentive awards is to issue either new shares of common stock or treasury
shares. During 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Firm settled all of its employee share-based awards by
issuing treasury shares. Refer to Note 23 for further information on the classification of share-
based awards for purposes of calculating earnings per share.

 Notes to consolidated financial statements 
RSUs, PSUs and SARs activity
Generally, compensation expense for RSUs and PSUs is measured based on the number of units granted
multiplied by the stock price at the grant date, and for SARs, is measured at the grant date using
the Black-Scholes valuation model. Compensation expense for these awards is recognized in net income
as described previously. The following table summarizes JPMorganChase’s RSUs, PSUs and SARs activity

 Note 10 – Investment securities 
Investment securities consist of debt securities that are classified as AFS or HTM. Debt securities
classified as trading assets are discussed in Note 2. Predominantly all of the Firm’s AFS and HTM
securities are held by Treasury and CIO in connection with its asset-liability management activities.
AFS securities are carried at fair value on the Consolidated balance sheets. Unrealized gains and
losses, after any applicable hedge accounting adjustments or allowance for credit losses, are
reported in AOCI. The specific identification method is used to determine realized gains and losses
on AFS securities, which are included in investment securities gains/(losses) on the Consolidated
statements of income. HTM securities, which the Firm has the intent and ability to hold until
maturity, are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for credit losses, on the Consolidated
balance sheets. For both AFS and HTM securities, purchase discounts or premiums are generally
amortized into interest income on a level-yield basis over the contractual life of the security.
However, premiums on certain callable debt securities are amortized to the earliest call date.

(a) Represents the amount of portfolio layer method basis adjustments related to AFS securities
hedged in a closed portfolio. Under U.S. GAAP portfolio layer method basis adjustments are not
allocated to individual securities, however the amounts impact the unrealized gains or losses in the
table for the types of securities being hedged. Refer to Note 1 and Note 5 for additional
information.
(b) The Firm purchased $ 4.7billion, $ 4.1billion and $ 33.7billion of HTM securities for the years
ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
(c) Effective January 1, 2023, the Firm adopted the portfolio layer method hedge accounting guidance
which permitted a transfer of HTM securities to AFS upon adoption. The Firm transferred obligations
of U.S. states and municipalities with a carrying value of $ 7.1billion resulting in the recognition
of $ 38million net pre-tax unrealized losses in AOCI. This transfer was a non-cash transaction. Refer
to Note 24 for additional information.
(d) The amortized cost of investment securities is reported net of allowance for credit losses of $
152million, $ 128million and $ 96million at December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
(e) Excludes $ 3.7billion and $ 2.8billion of accrued interest receivable at December 31, 2024 and
2023, respectively, included in accrued interest and accounts receivable on the Consolidated balance
sheets. The Firm generally does not recognize an allowance for credit losses on accrued interest
receivable, consistent with its policy to write them off no later than 90 days past due by reversing
interest income. The Firm did not reverse through interest income any accrued interest receivable for
the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.
 236 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K 
At December 31, 2024 , the investment securities portfolio consisted of debt securities with an
average credit rating of AA+ (based upon external ratings where available, and where not available,
based primarily upon internal risk ratings). Risk ratings are used to identify the credit quality of
securities and differentiate risk within the portfolio. The Firm’s internal risk ratings generally
align with the qualitative characteristics (e.g., borrower capacity to meet financial commitments and
vulnerability to changes in the economic environment) defined by S&P and Moody’s, however the
quantitative characteristics (e.g., probability of default (“PD”) and loss given default (“LGD”)) may
differ as they reflect internal historical experiences and assumptions. Risk ratings are assigned at
acquisition, reviewed on a regular and ongoing basis by Credit Risk Management and adjusted as
necessary over the life of the investment for updated information affecting the issuer’s ability to
fulfill its obligations.
AFS securities impairment
The following tables present the fair value and gross unrealized losses by aging category for AFS
securities at December 31, 2024 and 2023. The tables exclude U.S. Treasury and government agency
securities and U.S. GSE and government agency MBS with unrealized losses of $ 5.3billion and $
4.6billion, at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively; changes in the value of these securities are
generally driven by changes in interest rates rather than changes in their credit profile given the
explicit or implicit guarantees provided by the U.S. government.

 Notes to consolidated financial statements 
AFS securities are considered impaired if the
fair value is less than the amortized cost. The
Firm recognizes impairment losses in earnings if
the Firm has the intent to sell the debt
security, or if it is more likely than not that
the Firm will be required to sell the debt
security before recovery of its amortized cost.
In these circumstances the impairment loss is
recognized in investment securities
gains/(losses) in the Consolidated Statements of
Income and is equal to the full difference
between the amortized cost (net of allowance if
applicable) and the fair value of the security.
For impaired debt securities that the Firm has
the intent and ability to hold, the securities
are evaluated to determine if a credit loss
exists. If it is determined that a credit loss
exists, that loss is recognized as an allowance
for credit losses through the provision for
credit losses in the Consolidated Statements of
Income, limited by the amount of impairment. Any
impairment on debt securities that the Firm has
the intent and ability to hold not due to credit
losses is recorded in OCI. Factors considered in
evaluating credit losses include adverse
conditions specifically related to the industry,
geographic area or financial condition of the
issuer or underlying collateral of a security;
and payment structure of the security. When
assessing securities issued in a securitization
for credit losses, the Firm estimates cash flows
considering relevant market and economic data,
underlying loan-level data, and structural
features of the securitization, such as
subordination, excess spread,
overcollateralization or other forms of credit
enhancement, and compares the losses projected
for the underlying collateral (“pool losses”)
against the level of credit enhancement in the
securitization structure to determine whether
these features are sufficient to absorb the pool
losses, or whether a credit loss exists. For
beneficial interests in securitizations that are
rated below “AA” at their acquisition, or that
can be contractually prepaid or otherwise
settled in such a way that the Firm would not
recover substantially all of its recorded
investment, the Firm evaluates impairment for
credit losses when there is an adverse change in
expected cash flows. HTM securities – credit
risk Allowance for credit losses The allowance
for credit losses on HTM securities represents
expected credit losses over the remaining
expected life of the securities. The allowance
for credit losses on HTM obligations of U.S.
states and municipalities and commercial
mortgage-backed securities is calculated by
applying statistical credit loss factors
(estimated PD and LGD)
to the amortized cost. The credit loss factors
are derived using a weighted average of five
internally developed eight-quarter macroeconomic
scenarios, followed by a single year straight-
line interpolation to revert to long run
historical information for periods beyond the
forecast period. Refer to Note 13 for further
information on the eight-quarter macroeconomic
forecast. The allowance for credit losses on HTM
collateralized loan obligations and U.S.
residential mortgage-backed securities is
calculated as the difference between the
amortized cost and the present value of the cash
flows expected to be collected, discounted at
the security’s effective interest rate. These
cash flow estimates are developed based on
expectations of underlying collateral
performance derived using the eight-quarter
macroeconomic forecast and the single year
straight-line interpolation, as well as
considering the structural features of the
security. The application of different inputs
and assumptions into the calculation of the
allowance for credit losses is subject to
significant management judgment, and emphasizing
one input or assumption over another, or
considering other inputs or assumptions, could
affect the estimate of the allowance for credit
losses on HTM securities. Credit quality
indicator The primary credit quality indicator
for HTM securities is the risk rating assigned
to each security.At both December 31, 2024 and
2023, all HTM securities were rated investment
grade and were current and accruing, with
approximately 99% rated at least AA+ (based upon
external ratings where available, and where not
available, based primarily upon internal risk
ratings). Allowance for credit losses on
investment securities The allowance for credit
losses on investment securities was $
152million, $ 128million and $ 96million as of
December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively,
which included a cumulative-effect adjustment to
retained earnings related to the transfer of HTM
securities to AFS for the year ended December
31, 2023. Selected impacts of investment

(a) Average yield is computed using the effective yield of each security owned at the end of the
period, weighted based on the amortized cost of each security. The effective yield considers the
contractual coupon, amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, and the effect of related
hedging derivatives, including closed portfolio hedges. Taxable-equivalent amounts are used where
applicable. The effective yield excludes unscheduled principal prepayments; and accordingly, actual
maturities of securities may differ from their contractual or expected maturities as certain
securities may be prepaid. However, for certain callable debt securities, the average yield is
calculated to the earliest call date.
(b) For purposes of this table, the amortized cost of available-for-sale securities excludes the
allowance for credit losses of $ 49million and the portfolio layer fair value hedge basis adjustments
of $( 1.2) billion at December 31, 2024. The amortized cost of held-to-maturity securities also
excludes the allowance for credit losses of $ 103million at December 31, 2024.
(c) Substantially all of the Firm’s U.S. residential MBS and collateralized mortgage obligations are
due in 10years or more, based on contractual maturity. The estimated weighted-average life, which
reflects anticipated future prepayments, is approximately eight yearsfor agency residential MBS, six
yearsfor agency residential collateralized mortgage obligations, and five yearsfor nonagency
residential collateralized mortgage obligations.

 Notes to consolidated financial statements 
 Note 11 – Securities financing activities 
JPMorganChase enters into resale, repurchase, securities borrowed and securities loaned agreements
(collectively, “securities financing agreements”) primarily to finance the Firm’s inventory
positions, acquire securities to cover short sales, accommodate customers’ financing needs, settle
other securities obligations and to deploy the Firm’s excess cash. Securities financing agreements
are treated as collateralized financings on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets. Where appropriate
under applicable accounting guidance, securities financing agreements with the same counterparty are
reported on a net basis. Refer to Note 1 for further discussion of the offsetting of assets and
liabilities. Fees received and paid in connection with securities financing agreements are recorded
over the life of the agreement in interest income and interest expense on the Consolidated statements
of income. The Firm has elected the fair value option for certain securities financing agreements.
Refer to Note 3 for further information regarding the fair value option. The securities financing
agreements for which the fair value option has been elected are reported within securities purchased
under resale agreements, securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements, and securities
borrowed on the Consolidated balance sheets. Generally, for agreements carried at fair value,
current-period interest accruals are recorded within interest income and interest expense, with
changes in fair value reported in principal transactions revenue. However, for financial instruments
containing embedded derivatives that would be separately accounted for in accordance with accounting
guidance for hybrid instruments, all changes in fair value, including any interest elements, are
reported in principal transactions revenue. Securities financing agreements not elected under the
fair value option are measured at amortized cost. As a result of the Firm’s credit risk mitigation
practices described below, the Firm did not hold any allowance for credit losses with respect to
resale and securities borrowed arrangements as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. Credit risk mitigation
practices Securities financing agreements expose the Firm primarily to credit and liquidity risk. To
manage these risks, the Firm monitors the value of the underlying securities (predominantly high-
quality securities collateral, including government-issued debt and U.S. GSEs and government agencies
MBS) that it has received from or provided to its counterparties compared to the value of cash
proceeds and exchanged collateral, and either requests additional collateral or returns securities or
collateral when appropriate. Margin levels are initially established based upon the counterparty, the
type of underlying securities, and the permissible collateral, and are monitored on an ongoing basis.
In resale and securities borrowed agreements, the Firm is exposed to credit risk to the extent that
the value of the securities received is less than initial cash principal advanced and any collateral
amounts exchanged. In repurchase and securities loaned agreements, credit risk exposure arises to the
extent that the value of underlying securities advanced exceeds the value of the initial cash
principal received, and any collateral amounts exchanged. Additionally, the Firm typically enters
into master netting agreements and other similar arrangements with its counterparties, which provide
for the right to liquidate the underlying securities and any collateral amounts exchanged in the
event of a counterparty default. It is also the Firm’s policy to take possession, where possible, of
the securities underlying resale and securities borrowed agreements. Refer to Note 29 for further
information regarding assets pledged and collateral received in securities financing agreements.
 240 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K 
The table below summarizes the gross and net amounts of the Firm’s securities financing agreements,
as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. When the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with
respect to a master netting agreement with a counterparty and where other relevant netting criteria
under U.S. GAAP are met, the Firm nets, on the Consolidated balance sheets, the balances outstanding
under its securities financing agreements with the same counterparty. In addition, the Firm exchanges
securities and/or cash collateral with its counterparty to reduce the economic exposure with the
counterparty, but such collateral is not eligible for net Consolidated balance sheet presentation.
Where the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the counterparty master
netting agreement, such collateral, along with securities financing balances that do not meet all
these relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP, is presented in the table below as “Amounts not

Transfers not qualifying for sale accounting
At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Firm held $ 805million and $ 505million, respectively, of
financial assets for which the rights have been transferred to third parties; however, the transfers
did not qualify as a sale in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These transfers have been recognized as
collateralized financing transactions. The transferred assets are recorded in trading assets and
loans, and the corresponding liabilities are recorded primarily in short-term borrowings and long-
term debt on the Consolidated balance sheets.
 242 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K 
 Note 12 – Loans 
Loan accounting framework The accounting for a loan depends on management’s strategy for the loan.
The Firm accounts for loans based on the following categories: • Originated or purchased loans held-
for-investment (i.e., “retained”) • Loans held-for-sale • Loans at fair value The following provides
a detailed accounting discussion of the Firm’s loans by category: Loans held-for-investment
Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment, including PCD, are recorded at amortized cost,
reflecting the principal amount outstanding, net of the following: unamortized deferred loan fees,
costs, premiums or discounts; charge-offs; collection of cash; and foreign exchange. Credit card
loans also include billed finance charges and fees. Interest income Interest income on performing
loans held-for-investment is accrued and recognized as interest income at the contractual rate of
interest. Purchase price discounts or premiums, as well as net deferred loan fees or costs, are
recognized in interest income over the contractual life of the loan as an adjustment of yield. The
Firm classifies accrued interest on loans, including accrued but unbilled interest on credit card
loans, in accrued interest and accounts receivables on the Consolidated balance sheets. For credit
card loans, accrued interest once billed is then recognized in the loan balances, with the related
allowance recorded in the allowance for credit losses. Changes in the allowance for credit losses on
accrued interest on credit card loans are recognized in the provision for credit losses and charge-
offs are recognized by reversing interest income. For other loans, the Firm generally does not
recognize an allowance for credit losses on accrued interest receivables, consistent with its policy
to write them off no later than 90days past due by reversing interest income. Nonaccrual loans
Nonaccrual loans are those on which the accrual of interest has been suspended. Loans (other than
credit card loans and certain consumer loans insured by U.S. government agencies) are placed on
nonaccrual status and considered nonperforming when full payment of principal and interest is not
expected, regardless of delinquency status, or when principal and interest has been in default for a
period of 90days or more, unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection. A
loan is determined to be past due when the minimum payment is not received from the borrower by the
contractually specified due date or for certain loans (e.g., residential real estate loans), when a
monthly payment is due and unpaid for 30days or more. Finally, collateral-dependent loans are
typically maintained on nonaccrual status. On the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, all
interest accrued but not collected is reversed against interest income. In addition, the amortization
of deferred amounts is suspended. Interest income on nonaccrual loans may be recognized as cash
interest payments are received (i.e., on a cash basis) if the recorded loan balance is deemed fully
collectible; however, if there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectibility of the recorded loan
balance, all interest cash receipts are applied to reduce the carrying value of the loan (the cost
recovery method). For consumer loans, application of this policy typically results in the Firm
recognizing interest income on nonaccrual consumer loans on a cash basis. A loan may be returned to
accrual status when repayment is reasonably assured and there has been demonstrated performance under
the terms of the loan or, if applicable, the terms of the restructured loan. As permitted by
regulatory guidance, credit card loans are generally exempt from being placed on nonaccrual status;
accordingly, interest and fees related to credit card loans continue to accrue until the loan is
charged off or paid in full. Allowance for loan losses The allowance for loan losses represents the
estimated expected credit losses in the held-for-investment loan portfolio at the balance sheet date
and is recognized on the balance sheet as a contra asset, which brings the amortized cost to the net
carrying value. Changes in the allowance for loan losses resulting from lending-related activity,
macroeconomic variables, changes in credit and other inputs are recorded in the provision for credit
losses on the Firm’s Consolidated statements of income. Refer to Note 13 for further information on
the Firm’s accounting policies for the allowance for loan losses. Charge-offs Consumer loans are
generally charged off or charged down to the lower of the amortized cost or the net realizable value
of the underlying collateral (i.e., fair value less estimated costs to sell), with an offset to the
allowance for loan losses, upon reaching specified stages of delinquency in accordance with standards
established by the FFIEC. Residential real estate loans, unmodified credit card loans and scored
business banking loans are generally charged off no later than 180days past due. Scored auto and
closed-end consumer loans, including modified credit card
 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K 243 
 Notes to consolidated financial statements 
accounts placed on a fixed payment plan, are charged off no later than 120days past due. Certain
consumer loans are charged off or charged down to their net realizable value earlier than the FFIEC
charge-off standards in the following circumstances: • Loans modified to borrowers experiencing
financial difficulty that are determined to be collateral-dependent. • Loans to borrowers who have
experienced an event that suggests a loss is either known or highly certain are subject to
accelerated charge-off standards (e.g., residential real estate and auto loans are charged off or
charged down within 60days of receiving notification of a bankruptcy filing). • Auto loans upon
repossession of the automobile. Other than in certain limited circumstances, the Firm typically does
not recognize charge-offs on the government-guaranteed portion of loans. Wholesale loans are charged
off when it is highly certain that a loss has been realized. The determination of whether to
recognize a charge-off includes many factors, including the prioritization of the Firm’s claim in
bankruptcy, expectations of the workout/restructuring of the loan and valuation of the borrower’s
equity or the loan collateral. When a loan is charged down to the lower of its amortized cost or the
estimated net realizable value of the underlying collateral, the determination of the fair value of
the collateral depends on the type of collateral (e.g., securities, real estate). In cases where the
collateral is in the form of liquid securities, the fair value is based on quoted market prices or
broker quotes. For illiquid securities or other financial assets, the fair value of the collateral is
generally estimated using a discounted cash flow model. For residential real estate loans, collateral
values are based upon external valuation sources. When it becomes likely that a borrower is either
unable or unwilling to pay, the Firm utilizes a broker’s price opinion, appraisal and/or an automated
valuation model of the home based on an exterior-only valuation (“exterior opinions”), which is then
updated at least every 12months, or more frequently depending on various market factors. As soon as
practicable after the Firm receives the property in satisfaction of a debt (e.g., by taking legal
title or physical possession), the Firm generally obtains an appraisal based on an inspection that
includes the interior of the home (“interior appraisals”). Exterior opinions and interior appraisals
are discounted based upon the Firm’s experience with actual liquidation values as compared with the
estimated values provided by exterior opinions and interior appraisals, considering state-specific
factors. For commercial real estate loans, collateral values are generally based on appraisals from
internal and external valuation sources. Collateral values are typically updated every sixto twelve
months, either by obtaining a new appraisal or by performing an internal analysis, in accordance with
the Firm’s policies. The Firm also considers both borrower- and market-specific factors, which may
result in obtaining appraisal updates or broker price opinions at more frequent intervals. Loans
held-for-sale Loans held-for-sale are measured at the lower of cost or fair value, with valuation
changes recorded in noninterest revenue. For consumer loans, the valuation is performed on a
portfolio basis. For wholesale loans, the valuation is performed on an individual loan basis.
Interest income on loans held-for-sale is accrued and recognized based on the contractual rate of
interest. Loan origination fees or costs and purchase price discounts or premiums are deferred in a
contra loan account until the related loan is sold. The deferred fees or costs and discounts or
premiums are an adjustment to the basis of the loan and therefore are included in the periodic
determination of the lower of cost or fair value adjustments and/or the gain or loss recognized at
the time of sale. Because these loans are recognized at the lower of cost or fair value, the Firm’s
allowance for loan losses and charge-off policies do not apply to these loans. However, loans held-
for-sale are subject to the Firm’s nonaccrual policies. Loans at fair value Loans for which the fair
value option has been elected are measured at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in
noninterest revenue. Interest income on these loans is accrued and recognized based on the
contractual rate of interest. Changes in fair value are recognized in noninterest revenue. Loan
origination fees are recognized upfront in noninterest revenue. Loan origination costs are recognized
in the associated expense category as incurred. Because these loans are recognized at fair value, the
Firm’s allowance for loan losses and charge-off policies do not apply to these loans. However, loans
at fair value are subject to the Firm’s nonaccrual policies. Refer to Note 3 for further information
on the Firm’s elections of fair value accounting under the fair value option. Refer to Note 2 and
Note 3 for further information on loans carried at fair value and classified as trading assets.
 244 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K 
Loan classification changes Loans in the held-for-investment portfolio that management decides to
sell are transferred to the held-for-sale portfolio at the lower of cost or fair value on the date of
transfer. Credit-related losses are charged against the allowance for loan losses; non-credit related
losses such as those due to changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates are
recognized in noninterest revenue. In the event that management decides to retain a loan in the held-
for-sale portfolio, the loan is transferred to the held-for-investment portfolio at amortized cost on
the date of transfer. These loans are subsequently assessed for impairment based on the Firm’s
allowance methodology. Refer to Note 13 for a further discussion of the methodologies used in
establishing the Firm’s allowance for loan losses. Loan modifications The Firm seeks to modify
certain loans in conjunction with its loss mitigation activities. Through the modification,
JPMorganChase grants one or more concessions to a borrower who is experiencing financial difficulty
in order to minimize the Firm’s economic loss and avoid foreclosure or repossession of the
collateral, and to ultimately maximize payments received by the Firm from the borrower. The
concessions granted vary by program and by borrower-specific characteristics, and may include
interest rate reductions, term extensions, other-than-insignificant payment delays or principal
forgiveness. Loans, except for credit card loans, reported as FDMs are generally placed on nonaccrual
status, although in many cases such loans were already on nonaccrual status prior to modification.
These loans may be returned to performing status (the accrual of interest is resumed) if the
following criteria are met: (i) the borrower has performed under the modified terms for a minimum of
six monthsand/or sixpayments, and (ii) the Firm has an expectation that repayment of the modified
loan is reasonably assured based on, for example, the borrower’s debt capacity and level of future
earnings, collateral values, LTV ratios, and other current market considerations. In certain limited
and well-defined circumstances in which the loan is current at the modification date, such loans are
not placed on nonaccrual status at the time of modification. The allowance for credit losses
associated with FDMs is measured using the Firm’s established allowance methodology, which considers
the expected default rates for the modified loans. Refer to Note 13 for further discussion.
Foreclosed property The Firm acquires property from borrowers through loan restructurings, workouts,
and foreclosures. Property acquired may include real property (e.g., residential real estate, land,
and buildings) and other commercial and personal property (e.g., automobiles, aircraft, railcars, and
ships). The Firm recognizes foreclosed property upon receiving assets in satisfaction of a loan
(e.g., by taking legal title or physical possession). For loans collateralized by real property, the
Firm generally recognizes the asset received at foreclosure sale or upon the execution of a deed in
lieu of foreclosure transaction with the borrower. Foreclosed assets are reported in other assets on
the Consolidated balance sheets and initially recognized at fair value less estimated costs to sell.
Each quarter the fair value of the acquired property is reviewed and adjusted, if necessary, to the
lower of cost or fair value. Subsequent adjustments to fair value are charged/credited to noninterest
revenue. Operating expense, such as real estate taxes and maintenance, are charged to other expense.

Consumer, excluding credit card loan portfolio
Consumer loans, excluding credit card loans,
consist primarily of scored residential
mortgages, home equity loans and lines of
credit, auto and business banking loans, with a
focus on serving the prime consumer credit
market. These loans include home equity loans
secured by junior liens, prime mortgage loans
with an interest-only payment period, and
certain payment-option loans that may result in
negative amortization.

Delinquency rates are the primary credit quality indicator for consumer loans. Loans that are more
than 30days past due provide an early warning of borrowers who may be experiencing financial
difficulties and/or who may be unable or unwilling to repay the loan. As the loan continues to age,
it becomes more clear whether the borrower is likely to be unable or unwilling to pay. In the case of
residential real estate loans, late-stage delinquencies (greater than 150 days past due) are a strong
indicator of loans that will ultimately result in a foreclosure or similar liquidation transaction.
In addition to delinquency rates, other credit quality indicators for consumer loans vary based on
the class of loan, as follows: • For residential real estate loans, the current estimated LTV ratio,
or the combined LTV ratio in the case of junior lien loans, is an indicator of the potential loss
severity in the event of default. Additionally, LTV or combined LTV ratios can provide insight into a
borrower’s continued willingness to pay, as the delinquency rate of high-LTV loans tends to be
greater than that for loans where the borrower has equity in the collateral. The geographic
distribution of the loan collateral also provides insight as to the credit quality of the portfolio,
as factors such as the regional economy, home price changes and specific events such as natural
disasters, will affect credit quality. The borrower’s current or “refreshed” FICO score is a
secondary credit quality indicator for certain loans, as FICO scores are an indication of the
borrower’s credit payment history. Thus, a loan to a borrower with a low FICO score (less than 660)
is considered to be of higher risk than a loan to a borrower with a higher FICO score. Further, a
loan to a borrower with a high LTV ratio and a low FICO score is at greater risk of default than a
loan to a borrower that has both a high LTV ratio and a high FICO score. • For scored auto and
business banking loans, geographic distribution is an indicator of the credit performance of the
portfolio. Similar to residential real estate loans, geographic distribution provides insights into
the portfolio performance based on regional economic activity and events.

(a) Individual delinquency classifications include mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies
which were not material at December 31, 2024 and 2023.
(b) Excludes mortgage loans that are 30 or more days past due insured by U.S. government agencies
which were not material at December 31, 2024 and 2023. These amounts have been excluded based upon
the government guarantee.
(c) Purchased loans are included in the year in which they were originated.
Approximately 38% of the total revolving loans are senior lien loans; the remaining balance are
junior lien loans. The lien position the Firm holds is considered in the Firm’s allowance for credit
losses. Revolving loans that have been converted to term loans have higher delinquency rates than
those that are still within the revolving period. That is primarily because the fully-amortizing
payment that is generally required for those products is higher than the minimum payment options
available for revolving loans within the revolving period.

(a) Includes collateral-dependent residential real estate loans that are charged down to the fair
value of the underlying collateral less costs to sell. The Firm reports, in accordance with
regulatory guidance, residential real estate loans that have been discharged under Chapter 7
bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower (“Chapter 7 loans”) as collateral-dependent nonaccrual
loans, regardless of their delinquency status. At December 31, 2024, approximately 8% of Chapter 7
residential real estate loans were 30 days or more past due.
(b) Mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies excluded from nonaccrual loans were not
material at December 31, 2024 and 2023.
(c) Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an allowance. In accordance with regulatory
guidance, certain nonaccrual loans that are considered collateral-dependent have been charged down to
the lower of amortized cost or the fair value of their underlying collateral less costs to sell. If
the value of the underlying collateral improves subsequent to charge down, the related allowance may
be negative.
(d) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was $ 160million and $ 180million
for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
(e) Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans divided by the estimated current
property value. Current property values are estimated, at a minimum, quarterly, based on home
valuation models using nationally recognized home price index valuation estimates incorporating
actual data to the extent available and forecasted data where actual data is not available. Current
estimated combined LTV for junior lien home equity loans considers all available lien positions, as
well as unused lines, related to the property.
(f) Refreshed FICO scores represent each borrower’s most recent credit score, which is obtained by
the Firm on at least a quarterly basis.
(g) Includes residential real estate loans, primarily held in LLCs in AWM that did not have a
refreshed FICO score. These loans have been included in a FICO band based on management’s estimation
of the borrower’s credit quality.
(h) Included U.S. government-guaranteed loans as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.
(i) Excludes loans with no FICO and/or LTV data available.

Loan modifications The Firm grants certain
modifications of residential real estate loans
to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty.
The Firm's proprietary modification programs as
well as government programs, including U.S. GSE
programs, that generally provide various
modifications to borrowers experiencing
financial difficulty including, but not limited
to, interest rate reductions, term extensions,
other-than-insignificant payment deferral and
principal forgiveness that would otherwise have
been required under the terms of the original
agreement, are considered FDMs. In addition, the
Firm offers trial modifications of residential
real estate loans, which generally include a
three-monthtrial payment period during which the
borrower makes monthly payments under the
proposed modified loan terms. Loans in a trial
payment period continue to age and accrue
interest in accordance with the original
contractual terms. At the completion of a trial
period, the loan modification is considered
permanent. Financial effects of FDMs For the
year ended December 31, 2024, retained
residential real estate FDMs were $ 206million.
The financial effects of the FDMs, which were
predominantly in the form of term extensions and
interest rate reductions, included extending the
weighted-average life of the loans by 15years,
and reducing the weighted-average contractual
interest rate from 7.53% to 5.44% for the year
ended December 31, 2024. For the year ended
December 31, 2023, retained residential real
estate FDMs were $ 136million. The financial
effects of the FDMs, which were predominantly in
the form of term extensions and interest rate
reductions, included extending the weighted-
average life of the loans by 20years, and
reducing the weighted-average contractual
interest rate from 7.21% to 4.44% for the year
ended December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2024
and 2023, there were noadditional commitments to
lend to borrowers experiencing financial
difficulty whose loans have been modified as
FDMs. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and
2023, loans subject to a trial modification,
where the terms of the loans have not been
permanently modified, and Chapter 7 loans were
not material.
Payment status of FDMs

in the twelve months prior to the default were $
93million. Retained residential real estate FDMs
that defaulted during the year ended December

 Notes to consolidated financial statements 
Nature and extent of TDRs For periods ending
prior to January 1, 2023, modifications of
residential real estate loans where the Firm
granted concessions to borrowers who were
experiencing financial difficulty were generally
accounted for and reported as TDRs. Loans with
short-term or other insignificant modifications
that were not considered concessions were not
TDRs. For the year ended December 31, 2022, new
TDRs were $ 362million, and there were no
additional commitments to lend to borrowers
whose residential real estate loans were
modified in TDRs. The Firm’s proprietary
modification programs as well as government
programs, including U.S. GSE programs, generally
provide various concessions to financially
troubled borrowers including, but not limited
to, interest rate reductions, term or payment
extensions and delays of principal and/or
interest payments that would otherwise have been
required under the terms of the original
agreement.
The following table provides information about
how residential real estate loans were modified
in TDRs during the period presented. This table
excludes loans with short-term or other
insignificant modifications that are not
considered concessions.

(a) Represents concessions granted in permanent
modifications as a percentage of the number of
loans permanently modified. The sum of the
percentages exceeds 100% because predominantly
all of the modifications include more than one
type of concession. Concessions offered on trial
modifications are generally consistent with
those granted on permanent modifications.
(b) Includes variable interest rate to fixed
interest rate modifications and payment delays
that meet the definition of a TDR.

Credit card loan portfolio
The credit card portfolio segment includes credit card loans originated and purchased by the Firm.
Delinquency rates are the primary credit quality indicator for credit card loans as they provide an
early warning that borrowers may be experiencing difficulties (30 days past due); information on
those borrowers that have been delinquent for a longer period of time (90 days past due) is also
considered. In addition to delinquency rates, the geographic distribution of the loans provides
insight as to the credit quality of the portfolio based on the regional economy. While the borrower’s
credit score is another general indicator of credit quality, the Firm does not view credit scores as
a primary indicator of credit quality because the borrower’s credit score tends to be a lagging
indicator. The distribution of such scores provides a general indicator of credit quality trends
within the portfolio; however, the score does not capture all factors that would be predictive of
future credit performance. Refreshed FICO score information, which is obtained at least quarterly,
for a statistically significant random sample of the credit card portfolio is indicated in other
credit quality indicators. FICO is considered to be the industry benchmark for credit scores. The
Firm generally originates new credit card accounts to prime consumer borrowers. However, certain
cardholders’ FICO scores may decrease over time, depending on the performance of the cardholder and
changes in the credit score calculation.

Loan modifications
The Firm grants certain modifications of credit card loans to borrowers experiencing financial
difficulty. These modifications may involve placing the customer’s credit card account on a fixed
payment plan, generally for 60months, which typically includes reducing the interest rate on the
credit card account. If the borrower does not make the contractual payments when due under the
modified payment terms, the credit card loan continues to age and will be charged-off in accordance
with the Firm's standard charge-off policy. In most cases, the Firm does not reinstate the borrower's
line of credit.

granted concessions for most of the credit card
loans under long-term programs. These
concessions involved placing the customer’s
credit card account on a fixed payment plan,
generally for 60months, and typically included
reducing the interest rate on the credit card

 Notes to consolidated financial statements 
Wholesale loan portfolio
Wholesale loans include loans made to a variety of clients, ranging from large corporate and
institutional clients to small businesses and high-net-worth individuals. The primary credit quality
indicator for wholesale loans is the internal risk rating assigned to each loan. Risk ratings are
used to identify the credit quality of loans and differentiate risk within the portfolio. Risk
ratings on loans consider the PD and the LGD. The PD is the likelihood that a loan will default. The
LGD is the estimated loss on the loan that would be realized upon the default of the borrower and
takes into consideration collateral and structural support for each credit facility. Management
considers several factors to determine an appropriate internal risk rating, including the obligor’s
debt capacity and financial flexibility, the level of the obligor’s earnings, the amount and sources
for repayment, the level and nature of contingencies, management strength, and the industry and
geography in which the obligor operates. The Firm’s internal risk ratings generally align with the
qualitative characteristics (e.g., borrower capacity to meet financial commitments and vulnerability
to changes in the economic environment) defined by S&P and Moody’s, however the quantitative
characteristics (e.g., PD and LGD) may differ as they reflect internal historical experiences and
assumptions. The Firm generally considers internal ratings with qualitative characteristics
equivalent to BBB-/Baa3 or higher as investment grade, and these ratings have a lower PD and/or lower
LGD than non-investment grade ratings. Noninvestment-grade ratings are further classified as
noncriticized and criticized, and the criticized portion is further subdivided into performing and
nonaccrual loans, representing management’s assessment of the collectibility of principal and
interest. Criticized loans have a higher PD than noncriticized loans. The Firm’s definition of
criticized aligns with the U.S. banking regulatory definition of criticized exposures, which consist
of special mention, substandard and doubtful categories. Refer to Note 1 for additional information.
Risk ratings are reviewed on a regular and ongoing basis by Credit Risk Management and are adjusted
as necessary for updated information affecting the obligor’s ability to fulfill its obligations. As
noted above, the risk rating of a loan considers the industry in which the obligor conducts its

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, additional unfunded commitments on modified loans to borrowers
experiencing financial difficulty were $ 1.8billion at each period in Commercial and industrial, and
$ 69million and $ 4million, respectively, in Other loan class. Additional commitments on modified
loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty whose loans have been modified as FDMs in
Secured by real estate were not material at each period.
Nature and extent of TDRs
Prior to January 1, 2023, certain loan modifications were considered TDRs. These loan modifications
provided various concessions to borrower who were experiencing financial difficulty. Loans with
short-term or other insignificant modifications that were not considered concessions were not TDRs
nor were loans for which the Firm elected to suspend TDR accounting guidance under the option
provided by the CARES Act.
For the year ended December 31, 2022, new TDRs were $ 801million. New TDRs for the year ended
December 31, 2022 reflected extended maturity dates and covenant waivers primarily in the Commercial
and Industrial loan class. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the impact of these modifications
resulting in new TDRs was not material to the Firm.
As a result of the elimination of the requirement to assess whether a modification is reasonably
expected or involves a concession, the population of loans considered FDMs is greater than the
population previously considered TDRs.

 Notes to consolidated financial statements 
 Note 13 – Allowance for credit losses 
The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents management's estimate of expected credit losses
over the remaining expected life of the Firm's financial assets measured at amortized cost and
certain off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. The allowance for credit losses generally
comprises: • the allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s retained loan portfolios (scored
and risk-rated), • the allowance for lending-related commitments, which is presented on the
Consolidated balance sheets in accounts payable and other liabilities, and • the allowance for credit
losses on investment securities, which is reflected in investment securities on the Consolidated
balance sheets. The income statement effect of all changes in the allowance for credit losses is
recognized in the provision for credit losses. Determining the appropriateness of the allowance for
credit losses is complex and requires significant judgment by management about the effect of matters
that are inherently uncertain. At least quarterly, the allowance for credit losses is reviewed by the
CRO, the CFO and the Controller of the Firm. Subsequent evaluations of credit exposures, considering
the macroeconomic conditions, forecasts and other factors then prevailing, may result in significant
changes in the allowance for credit losses in future periods. The Firm’s policies used to determine
its allowance for loan losses and its allowance for lending-related commitments are described in the
following paragraphs. Refer to Note 10 for a description of the policies used to determine the
allowance for credit losses on investment securities. Methodology for allowances for loan losses and
lending-related commitments The allowance for loan losses and allowance for lending-related
commitments represents expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of retained loans and
lending-related commitments that are not unconditionally cancellable. The Firm does not record an
allowance for future draws on unconditionally cancellable lending-related commitments (e.g., credit
cards). Expected losses related to accrued interest on credit card loans are considered in the Firm’s
allowance for loan losses. However, the Firm does not record an allowance on other accrued interest
receivables, due to its policy to write these receivables off no later than 90days past due by
reversing interest income. The expected life of each instrument is determined by considering its
contractual term, expected prepayments, cancellation features, and certain extension and call
options. The expected life of funded credit card loans is generally estimated by considering expected
future payments on the credit card account, and determining how much of those amounts should be
allocated to repayments of the funded loan balance (as of the balance sheet date) versus other
account activity. This allocation is made using an approach that incorporates the payment application
requirements of the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009, generally
paying down the highest interest rate balances first. The estimate of expected credit losses includes
expected recoveries of amounts previously charged off or expected to be charged off, even if such
recoveries result in a negative allowance. Collective and Individual Assessments When calculating the
allowance for loan losses and the allowance for lending-related commitments, the Firm assesses
whether exposures share similar risk characteristics. If similar risk characteristics exist, the Firm
estimates expected credit losses collectively, considering the risk associated with a particular pool
and the probability that the exposures within the pool will deteriorate or default. The assessment of
risk characteristics is subject to significant management judgment. Emphasizing one characteristic
over another or considering additional characteristics could affect the allowance. • Relevant risk
characteristics for the consumer portfolio include product type, delinquency status, current FICO
scores, geographic distribution, and, for collateralized loans, current LTV ratios. • Relevant risk
characteristics for the wholesale portfolio include risk rating, delinquency status, tenor, level and
type of collateral, LOB, geography, industry, credit enhancement, product type, facility purpose, and
payment terms. The majority of the Firm’s credit exposures share risk characteristics with other
similar exposures, and as a result are collectively assessed for impairment (“portfolio-based
component”). The portfolio-based component covers consumer loans, performing risk-rated loans and
certain lending-related commitments. If an exposure does not share risk characteristics with other
exposures, the Firm generally estimates expected credit losses on an individual basis, considering
expected repayment and conditions impacting that individual exposure (“asset-specific component”).
The asset-specific component covers collateral-dependent loans and risk-rated loans that have been
placed on nonaccrual status. Portfolio-based component The portfolio-based component begins with a
quantitative calculation that considers the likelihood of the borrower changing delinquency status or
moving from one risk rating to another. The quantitative calculation covers expected credit losses
over an instrument’s expected life and is estimated by applying credit loss factors to the Firm’s
estimated exposure at default. The credit loss factors incorporate the
 266 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K 
probability of borrower default as well as loss severity in the event of default. They are derived
using a weighted average of five internally developed macroeconomic scenarios over an eight-quarter
forecast period, followed by a single year straight-line interpolation to revert to long run
historical information for periods beyond the eight-quarter forecast period. The five macroeconomic
scenarios consist of a central, relative adverse, extreme adverse, relative upside and extreme upside
scenario, and are updated by the Firm’s central forecasting team. The scenarios take into
consideration the Firm’s macroeconomic outlook, internal perspectives from subject matter experts
across the Firm, and market consensus and involve a governed process that incorporates feedback from
senior management across LOBs, Corporate Finance and Risk Management. The quantitative calculation is
adjusted to take into consideration model imprecision, emerging risk assessments, trends and other
subjective factors that are not yet reflected in the calculation. These adjustments are accomplished
in part by analyzing the historical loss experience, including during stressed periods, for each
major product or model. Management applies judgment in making this adjustment, including taking into
account uncertainties associated with the economic and political conditions, quality of underwriting
standards, borrower behavior, credit concentrations or deterioration within an industry, product or
portfolio, as well as other relevant internal and external factors affecting the credit quality of
the portfolio. In certain instances, the interrelationships between these factors create further
uncertainties. The application of different inputs into the quantitative calculation, and the
assumptions used by management to adjust the quantitative calculation, are subject to significant
management judgment, and emphasizing one input or assumption over another, or considering other
inputs or assumptions, could affect the estimate of the allowance for loan losses and the allowance
for lending-related commitments. Asset-specific component To determine the asset-specific component
of the allowance, collateral-dependent loans (including those loans for which foreclosure is
probable) and nonaccrual risk-rated loans in the wholesale portfolio segment are generally evaluated
individually. For collateral-dependent loans, the fair value of collateral less estimated costs to
sell, as applicable, is used to determine the charge-off amount for declines in value (to reduce the
amortized cost of the loan to the fair value of collateral) or the amount of negative allowance that
should be recognized (for recoveries of prior charge-offs associated with improvements in the fair
value of the collateral). For non-collateral dependent loans, the Firm generally measures the asset-
specific allowance as the difference between the amortized cost of the loan and the present value of
the cash flows expected to be collected, discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate. Subsequent
changes in impairment are generally recognized as an adjustment to the allowance for loan losses. The
asset-specific component of the allowance for non-collateral dependent loans incorporates the effect
of the modification on the loan’s expected cash flows including changes in interest rates, principal
forgiveness, and other concessions, as well as management’s expectation of the borrower’s ability to
repay under the modified terms. Estimating the timing and amounts of future cash flows is highly
judgmental as these cash flow projections rely upon estimates such as loss severities, asset
valuations, the amounts and timing of interest or principal payments (including any expected
prepayments) or other factors that are reflective of current and expected market conditions. These
estimates are, in turn, dependent on factors such as the duration of current overall economic
conditions, industry, portfolio, or borrower-specific factors, the expected outcome of insolvency
proceedings as well as, in certain circumstances, other economic factors. All of these estimates and
assumptions require significant management judgment and certain assumptions are highly subjective.
Other financial assets In addition to loans and investment securities, the Firm holds other financial
assets that are measured at amortized cost on the Consolidated balance sheets, including credit
exposures arising from lending activities subject to collateral maintenance requirements. Management
estimates the allowance for other financial assets using various techniques considering historical
losses and current economic conditions. Credit risk arising from lending activities subject to
collateral maintenance requirements is generally mitigated by factors such as the short-term nature
of the activity, the fair value of collateral held and the Firm’s right to call for, and the
borrower’s obligation to provide additional margin when the fair value of the collateral declines.
Because of these mitigating factors, these exposures generally do not require an allowance for credit
losses. However, management may also consider other factors such as the borrower’s ongoing ability to
provide collateral to satisfy margin requirements, or whether collateral is significantly
concentrated in an individual issuer or in securities with similar risk characteristics. If in
management’s judgment, an allowance for credit losses for these exposures is required, the Firm
estimates expected credit losses based on the value of the collateral and probability of borrower
default.

 Notes to consolidated financial statements 
Discussion of changes in the allowance
The allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2024 was $ 26.9billion, reflecting a net addition
of $ 2.1billion from December 31, 2023. The net addition to the allowance for credit losses included:
• $ 2.1billion in consumer , reflecting: – a $ 2.2billion net addition in Card Services,
predominantly driven by loan growth, reflecting higher revolving balances, including the seasoning of
vintages originated in recent years, partially offset by – a $ 125million net reduction in Home
Lending in the first quarter of 2024, and • a net reduction of $ 30million in wholesale , reflecting:
– changes in certain macroeconomic variables, an update to loss assumptions on certain loans in
Markets, and a reduction due to charge-offs largely from collateral-dependent loans, predominantly
offset by – net downgrade activity, primarily in Real Estate, and the impact of incorporating the
First Republic portfolio into the Firm’s modeled credit loss estimates in the second quarter of 2024.
The Firm’s qualitative adjustments continued to include additional weight placed on the adverse
scenarios to reflect ongoing uncertainties and downside risks related to the geopolitical and
macroeconomic environment. The Firm's allowance for credit losses is estimated using a weighted
average of five internally developed macroeconomic scenarios. The adverse scenarios incorporate more
punitive macroeconomic factors than the central case assumptions provided in the table below,
resulting in: • a weighted average U.S. unemployment rate peaking at 5.5% in the fourth quarter of
2025, and • a weighted average U.S. real GDP level that is 1.9% lower than the central case at the
end of the second quarter of 2026.
The following table presents the Firm’s central
case assumptions for the periods presented:

(a) Reflects quarterly average of forecasted
U.S. unemployment rate.
(b) The year over year growth in U.S. real GDP
in the forecast horizon of the central scenario
is calculated as the percentage change in U.S.
real GDP levels from the prior year.
Subsequent changes to this forecast and related
estimates will be reflected in the provision for
credit losses in future periods. Refer to Note
12 for additional information on the consumer
and wholesale credit portfolios. Refer to

Refer to Note 1 on page 177 for a further description of the Firm’s accounting policies regarding
consolidation of and involvement with VIEs.
The following table summarizes the most significant types of Firm-sponsored VIEs by business segment.
The Firm considers a “Firm-sponsored” VIE to include any entity where: (1) JPMorganChase is the
primary beneficiary of the structure; (2) the VIE is used by JPMorganChase to securitize Firm assets;
(3) the VIE issues financial instruments with the JPMorganChase name; or (4) the entity is a
JPMorganChase–administered asset-backed commercial paper conduit.

The Firm’s other business segments and Corporate are also involved with VIEs (both third-party and
Firm-sponsored), but to a lesser extent, as follows:
• Asset & Wealth Management: AWM sponsors and manages certain funds that are deemed VIEs. As asset
manager of the funds, AWM earns a fee based on assets managed; the fee varies with each fund’s
investment objective and is competitively priced. For fund entities that qualify as VIEs, AWM’s
interests are, in certain cases, considered to be significant variable interests that result in
consolidation of the financial results of these entities.
• Corporate : Corporate is involved with entities that may meet the definition of VIEs; however these
entities are generally subject to specialized investment company accounting, which does not require
the consolidation of investments, including VIEs. In addition, Treasury and CIO invest in securities
generally issued by third parties which may meet the definition of VIEs (e.g., issuers of asset-
backed securities). In general, the Firm does not have the power to direct the significant activities
of these entities and therefore does not consolidate these entities. Refer to Note 10 for further
information on the Firm’s investment securities portfolio.
In addition, CIB also invests in and provides financing, lending-related services and other services
to VIEs sponsored by third parties. Refer to page 276 of this Note for more information on the VIEs
sponsored by third parties.
Significant Firm-sponsored VIEs
Credit card securitizations CCB’s Card Services business may securitize originated credit card loans,
primarily through the Chase Issuance Trust (the “Trust”). The Firm’s continuing involvement in credit
card securitizations includes servicing the receivables, retaining an undivided seller’s interest in
the receivables, retaining certain senior and subordinated securities and maintaining escrow
accounts. The Firm consolidates the assets and liabilities of its sponsored credit card trusts as it
is considered to be the primary beneficiary of these securitization trusts based on the Firm’s
ability to direct the activities of these VIEs through its servicing responsibilities and other
duties, including making decisions as to the receivables that are transferred into those trusts and
as to any related modifications and workouts. Additionally, the nature and extent of the Firm’s other
continuing involvement with the trusts, as indicated above, obligates the Firm to absorb losses and
gives the Firm the right to receive certain benefits from these VIEs that could potentially be
significant. The underlying securitized credit card receivables and other assets of the
securitization trusts are available only for payment of the beneficial interests issued by the
securitization trusts; they are not available to pay the Firm’s other obligations or the claims of
the Firm’s creditors. The agreements with the credit card securitization trusts require the Firm to
maintain a minimum undivided interest in the credit card trusts (generally 5%). As of December 31,
2024 and 2023, the Firm held undivided interests in Firm-sponsored credit card securitization trusts
of $ 6.6billion and $ 4.9billion, respectively. The Firm maintained an average undivided interest in
principal receivables owned by
 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K 271 
 Notes to consolidated financial statements 
those trusts of approximately 45% and 65% for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023,
respectively. The Firm did not retain any senior securities and retained $ 1.5billion of subordinated
securities in certain of its credit card securitization trusts at both December 31, 2024 and 2023.
The Firm’s undivided interests in the credit card trusts and securities retained are eliminated in
consolidation. Firm-sponsored mortgage and other securitization trusts The Firm securitizes (or has
securitized) originated and purchased residential mortgages, commercial mortgages and other consumer
loans primarily in its CCB and CIB businesses. Depending on the particular transaction, as well as
the respective business involved, the Firm may act as the servicer of the loans and/or retain certain
beneficial interests in the securitization trusts.
The following tables present the total unpaid principal amount of assets held in Firm-sponsored
private-label securitization entities, including those in which the Firm has continuing involvement,
and those that are consolidated by the Firm. Continuing involvement includes servicing the loans,
holding senior interests or subordinated interests (including amounts required to be held pursuant to
credit risk retention rules), recourse or guarantee arrangements, and derivative contracts. In
certain instances, the Firm’s only continuing involvement is servicing the loans. The Firm’s maximum
loss exposure from retained and purchased interests is the carrying value of these interests. Refer
to page 279 of this Note for information on the securitization-related loan delinquencies and
liquidation losses.

interests in prime residential mortgages consisted of $ 2.9billion and $ 2.5billion of investment-
grade retained interests at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $ 216million and $
88million of noninvestment-grade retained interests at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The
retained interests in commercial and other securitization trusts consisted of $ 6.0billion and $
6.1billion of investment-grade retained interests, and $ 1.4billion and $ 1.7billion of
noninvestment-grade retained interests at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
 272 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K 
Residential mortgage The Firm securitizes
residential mortgage loans originated by CCB, as
well as residential mortgage loans purchased
from third parties by either CCB or CIB. CCB
generally retains servicing for all residential
mortgage loans it originated or purchased, and
for certain mortgage loans purchased by CIB. For
securitizations of loans serviced by CCB, the
Firm has the power to direct the significant
activities of the VIE because it is responsible
for decisions related to loan modifications and
workouts. CCB may also retain an interest upon
securitization. In addition, CIB engages in
underwriting and trading activities involving
securities issued by Firm-sponsored
securitization trusts. As a result, CIB at times
retains senior and/or subordinated interests
(including residual interests and amounts
required to be held pursuant to credit risk
retention rules) in residential mortgage
securitizations at the time of securitization,
and/or reacquires positions in the secondary
market in the normal course of business. In
certain instances, as a result of the positions
retained or reacquired by CIB or held by
Treasury and CIO or CCB, when considered
together with the servicing arrangements entered
into by CCB, the Firm is deemed to be the
primary beneficiary of certain securitization
trusts. The Firm does not consolidate
residential mortgage securitizations (Firm-
sponsored or third-party-sponsored) when it is
not the servicer (and therefore does not have
the power to direct the most significant
activities of the trust) or does not hold a
beneficial interest in the trust that could
potentially be significant to the trust.
Commercial mortgages and other consumer
securitizations CIB originates and securitizes
commercial mortgage loans, and engages in
underwriting and trading activities involving
the securities issued by securitization trusts.
CIB may retain unsold senior and/or subordinated
interests (including amounts required to be held
pursuant to credit risk retention rules) in
commercial mortgage securitizations at the time
of securitization but, generally, the Firm does
not service commercial loan securitizations.
Treasury and CIO may choose to invest in these
securitizations as well. For commercial mortgage
securitizations the power to direct the
significant activities of the VIE generally is
held by the servicer or investors in a specified
class of securities (“controlling class”). The
Firm generally does not retain an interest in
the controlling class in its sponsored
commercial mortgage securitization transactions.
Re-securitizations The Firm engages in certain
re-securitization transactions in which debt
securities are transferred to a VIE in exchange
for new beneficial interests. These transfers
occur in connection with both U.S. GSEs and
government agency sponsored VIEs, which are
backed by residential mortgages. The Firm’s
consolidation analysis is largely dependent on
the Firm’s role and interest in the re-
securitization trusts.
The following table presents the principal
amount of securities transferred to re-
securitization VIEs.
 Year ended December 31, 
 (in millions) 2024 2023 2022 
 ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── 
 Transfers of securities to VIEs 
 U.S. GSEs and government agencies $ 44,456 $ 18,864 $ 16,128 
Most re-securitizations with which the Firm is
involved are client-driven transactions in which
a specific client or group of clients is seeking
a specific return or risk profile. For these
transactions, the Firm has concluded that the
decision-making power of the entity is shared
between the Firm and its clients, considering
the joint effort and decisions in establishing
the re-securitization trust and its assets, as
well as the significant economic interest the
client holds in the re-securitization trust;
therefore the Firm does not consolidate the re-
securitization VIE. The Firm did not transfer
any private label securities to re-
securitization VIEs during 2024, 2023 and 2022,
and retained interests in any such Firm-
sponsored VIEs as of December 31, 2024 and 2023
were not material. Additionally, the Firm may
invest in beneficial interests of third-party-
sponsored re-securitizations and generally
purchases these interests in the secondary
market. In these circumstances, the Firm does
not have the unilateral ability to direct the
most significant activities of the re-
securitization trust, either because it was not
involved in the initial design of the trust, or
the Firm was involved with an independent third-
party sponsor and demonstrated shared power over
the creation of the trust; therefore, the Firm
does not consolidate the re-securitization VIE.

 Interest in VIEs $ 3,219 $ 3,371 
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Firm did not consolidate any U.S. GSE and government agency re-
securitization VIEs or any Firm-sponsored private-label re-securitization VIEs. Multi-seller conduits
Multi-seller conduit entities are separate bankruptcy remote entities that provide secured financing,
collateralized by pools of receivables and other financial assets, to customers of the Firm. The
conduits fund their financing facilities through the issuance of highly rated commercial paper. The
primary source of repayment of the commercial paper is the cash flows from the pools of assets. In
most instances, the assets are structured with deal-specific credit enhancements provided to the
conduits by the customers (i.e., sellers) or other third parties. Deal-specific credit enhancements
are generally structured to cover a multiple of historical losses expected on the pool of assets, and
are typically in the form of overcollateralization provided by the seller. The deal-specific credit
enhancements mitigate the Firm’s potential losses on its agreements with the conduits. To ensure
timely repayment of the commercial paper, and to provide the conduits with funding to provide
financing to customers in the event that the conduits do not obtain funding in the commercial paper
market, each asset pool financed by the conduits has a minimum 100% deal-specific liquidity facility
associated with it provided by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. also provides the
multi-seller conduit vehicles with uncommitted program-wide liquidity facilities and program-wide
credit enhancement in the form of standby letters of credit. The amount of program-wide credit
enhancement required is based upon commercial paper issuance and approximates 10% of the outstanding
balance of commercial paper. The Firm consolidates its Firm-administered multi-seller conduits, as
the Firm has both the power to direct the significant activities of the conduits and a potentially
significant economic interest in the conduits. As administrative agent and in its role in structuring
transactions, the Firm makes decisions regarding asset types and credit quality, and manages the
commercial paper funding needs of the conduits. The Firm’s interests that could potentially be
significant to the VIEs include the fees received as administrative agent and liquidity and program-
wide
credit enhancement provider, as well as the potential exposure created by the liquidity and credit
enhancement facilities provided to the conduits. In the normal course of business, JPMorganChase
makes markets in and invests in commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller
conduits. The Firm held $ 2.9billion and $ 9.8billion of the commercial paper issued by the Firm-
administered multi-seller conduits at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which have been
eliminated in consolidation. The Firm’s investments reflect the Firm’s funding needs and capacity and
were not driven by market illiquidity. Other than the amounts required to be held pursuant to credit
risk retention rules, the Firm is not obligated under any agreement to purchase the commercial paper
issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. Deal-specific liquidity facilities, program-
wide liquidity and credit enhancement provided by the Firm have been eliminated in consolidation. The
Firm or the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits provide lending-related commitments to certain
clients of the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. The unfunded commitments were $ 10.3billion
and $ 10.8billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and are reported as off-balance sheet
lending-related commitments in other unfunded commitments to extend credit. Refer to Note 28 for more
information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. Municipal bond vehicles Municipal bond
vehicles or tender option bond (“TOB”) trusts allow institutions to finance their municipal bond
investments at short-term rates. In a typical TOB transaction, the trust purchases highly rated
municipal bond(s) of a single issuer and funds the purchase by issuing two types of securities: (1)
puttable floating-rate certificates (“floaters”) and (2) inverse floating-rate residual interests
(“residuals”). The floaters are typically purchased by money market funds or other short-term
investors and may be tendered, with requisite notice, to the TOB trust. The residuals are retained by
the investor seeking to finance its municipal bond investment. TOB transactions where the residual is
held by a third-party investor are typically known as customer TOB trusts, and non-customer TOB
trusts are transactions where the Residual is retained by the Firm. Customer TOB trusts are sponsored
by a third party. The Firm serves as sponsor for all non-customer TOB transactions. The Firm may
provide various services to a TOB trust, including remarketing agent, liquidity or tender option
provider, and/or sponsor. J.P. Morgan Securities LLC may serve as a remarketing agent on the floaters
for TOB trusts. The remarketing agent is responsible for establishing the periodic variable rate on
the floaters, conducting the initial
 274 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K 
placement and remarketing tendered floaters. The remarketing agent may, but is not obligated to, make
markets in floaters. Floaters held by the Firm were not material during 2024 and 2023. JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A. or J.P. Morgan Securities LLC often serves as the sole liquidity or tender option provider
for the TOB trusts. The liquidity provider’s obligation to perform is conditional and is limited by
certain events (“Termination Events”), which include bankruptcy or failure to pay by the municipal
bond issuer or credit enhancement provider, an event of taxability on the municipal bonds or the
immediate downgrade of the municipal bond to below investment grade. In addition, the liquidity
provider’s exposure is typically further limited by the high credit quality of the underlying
municipal bonds, the excess collateralization in the vehicle, or, in certain transactions, the
reimbursement agreements with the Residual holders. Holders of the floaters may “put,” or tender,
their floaters to the TOB trust. If the remarketing agent cannot successfully remarket the floaters
to another investor, the liquidity provider either provides a loan to the TOB trust for the TOB
trust’s purchase of the floaters, or it directly purchases the tendered floaters. TOB trusts are
considered to be variable interest entities. The Firm consolidates non-customer TOB trusts because as
the Residual holder, the Firm has the right to make decisions that significantly impact the economic
performance of the municipal bond vehicle, and it has the right to receive benefits and bear losses
that could potentially be significant to the municipal bond vehicle.

 Notes to consolidated financial statements 
VIEs sponsored by third parties The Firm enters
into transactions with VIEs structured by other
parties. These include, for example, acting as a
derivative counterparty, liquidity provider,
investor, underwriter, placement agent,
remarketing agent, trustee or custodian. These
transactions are conducted at arm’s-length, and
individual credit decisions are based on the
analysis of the specific VIE, taking into
consideration the quality of the underlying
assets. Where the Firm does not have the power
to direct the activities of the VIE that most
significantly impact the VIE’s economic
performance, or a variable interest that could
potentially be significant, the Firm generally
does not consolidate the VIE, but it records and
reports these positions on its Consolidated
balance sheets in the same manner it would
record and report positions in respect of any
other third-party transaction. Tax credit
vehicles The Firm holds investments in
unconsolidated tax credit vehicles, which are
limited partnerships and similar entities that
own and operate affordable housing, alternative
energy, and other projects. These entities are
primarily considered VIEs. A third party is
typically the general partner or managing member
and has control over the significant activities
of the tax credit vehicles, and accordingly the
Firm does not consolidate tax credit vehicles.
The Firm generally invests in these partnerships
as a limited partner and earns a return
primarily through the receipt of tax credits
allocated to the projects. The maximum loss
exposure, represented by equity investments and
funding commitments, was $ 35.2billion and $
35.1billion, of which $ 15.0billion and $
14.7billion was unfunded at December 31, 2024
and 2023, respectively. The Firm assesses each
project and to reduce the risk of loss, may
withhold varying amounts of its capital
investment until the project qualifies for tax
credits. Refer to Note 28 for more information
on off-balance sheet lending-related
commitments. Effective January 1, 2024, the Firm
adopted updates to the Accounting for
Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the
Proportional Amortization Method guidance which
expanded the types of tax-oriented investments,
beyond affordable housing tax credit
investments, that the Firm can elect on a
program by program basis, to be accounted for
using the proportional amortization method.
Refer to Notes 1, 6 and 25 for further
information. The proportional amortization
method requires the cost of eligible
investments, within an elected program, be
amortized in proportion to the tax benefits
received with the resulting amortization
reported directly in income tax expense, which
aligns with the associated tax credits and other
tax benefits. Investments must meet certain
criteria to be eligible,
including that substantially all of the return
is from income tax credits and other income tax
benefits. In addition, under this method
deferred taxes are generally not recorded as the
investment is now amortized in proportion to the
income tax credits and other income tax benefits
received. Delayed equity contributions that are
unconditional and legally binding or conditional
and probable of occurring are recorded in other
liabilities with a corresponding increase in the
carrying value of the investment. The guidance
also requires a reevaluation of eligible
investments when significant modifications or
events occur that result in a change in the
nature of the investment or a change in the
Firm's relationship with the underlying project.
During the period, there were no significant
modifications or events that resulted in a
change in the nature of an eligible investment
or a change in the Firm's relationship with the
underlying project.
The following table provides information on tax-
oriented investments for which the Firm elected
to apply the proportional amortization method.

Customer municipal bond vehicles (TOB trusts) The Firm may provide various services to customer TOB
trusts, including remarketing agent, liquidity or tender option provider. In certain customer TOB
transactions, the Firm, as liquidity provider, has entered into a reimbursement agreement with the
Residual holder. In those transactions, upon the termination of the vehicle, the Firm has recourse to
the third-party Residual holders for any shortfall. The Firm does not have any intent to protect
Residual holders from potential losses on any of the underlying municipal bonds. The Firm does not
consolidate customer TOB trusts, since the Firm does not have the power to make decisions that
significantly impact the economic performance of the municipal bond vehicle. The Firm’s maximum
exposure as a liquidity provider to customer TOB trusts at December 31, 2024 and 2023, was $
5.8billion and $ 5.1billion, respectively. The fair value of assets held by such VIEs at December 31,
2024 and 2023 was $ 8.1billion and $ 7.3billion, respectively. Loan securitizations The Firm has
securitized and sold a variety of loans, including residential mortgages, credit card receivables,
commercial mortgages and other consumer loans. The purposes of these securitization transactions were
to satisfy investor demand and to generate liquidity for the Firm. For loan securitizations in which
the Firm is not required to consolidate the trust, the Firm records the transfer of the loan
receivable to the trust as a sale when all of the following accounting criteria for a sale are met:
(1) the transferred financial assets are legally isolated from the Firm’s creditors; (2) the
transferee or beneficial interest holder can pledge or exchange the transferred financial assets; and
(3) the Firm does not maintain effective control over the transferred financial assets (e.g., the
Firm cannot repurchase the transferred assets before their maturity and it does not have the ability
to unilaterally cause the holder to return the transferred assets). For loan securitizations
accounted for as a sale, the Firm recognizes a gain or loss based on the difference between the value
of proceeds received (including cash, beneficial interests, or servicing assets received) and the
carrying value of the assets sold. Gains and losses on securitizations are reported in noninterest
revenue.

Loans and excess MSRs sold to U.S. government-

reported in the securitization activity tables
above, the Firm, in the normal course of
business, sells originated and purchased
mortgage loans and certain originated excess
MSRs on a nonrecourse basis, predominantly to
U.S. GSEs. These loans and excess MSRs are sold
primarily for the purpose of securitization by
the U.S. GSEs, who provide certain guarantee
provisions (e.g., credit enhancement of the
loans). The Firm also sells loans into
securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie
Mae guidelines; these loans are typically
insured or guaranteed by another U.S. government
agency. The Firm does not consolidate the
securitization vehicles underlying these
transactions as it is not the primary
beneficiary. For a limited number of loan sales,
the Firm is obligated to share a portion of the
credit risk associated with the sold loans with
the purchaser. Refer to Note 28 for additional
information about the Firm’s loan sales- and
securitization-related indemnifications and Note

Options to repurchase delinquent loans In addition to the Firm’s obligation to repurchase certain
loans due to material breaches of representations and warranties as discussed in Note 28, the Firm
also has the option to repurchase delinquent loans that it services for Ginnie Mae loan pools, as
well as for other U.S. government agencies under certain arrangements. The Firm typically elects to
repurchase delinquent loans from Ginnie Mae loan pools as it continues to service them and/or manage
the foreclosure process in accordance with the applicable requirements, and such loans continue to be
insured or guaranteed. When the Firm’s repurchase option becomes exercisable, such loans must be
reported on the Consolidated balance sheets as a loan with a corresponding liability. Refer to Note

Note 15 – Goodwill, mortgage servicing rights,
and other intangible assets
Goodwill Goodwill is recorded upon completion of
a business combination as the difference between
the purchase price and the fair value of the net
assets acquired, and can be adjusted up to one
year from the acquisition date as additional
information pertaining to facts and
circumstances that existed as of the acquisition
date is obtained about the fair value of assets
acquired and liabilities assumed. Subsequent to
initial recognition, goodwill is not amortized
but is tested for impairment during the fourth
quarter of each fiscal year, or more often if
events or circumstances, such as adverse changes
in the business climate, indicate that there may
be an impairment. The goodwill associated with
each business combination is allocated to the
related reporting units, which are generally
determined based on how the Firm’s businesses
are managed and how they are reviewed. The
following table presents goodwill attributed to
the reportable business segments and Corporate.

(b) Primarily foreign currency adjustments.
Goodwill impairment testing The Firm’s goodwill was not impaired at December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.
The goodwill impairment test is generally performed by comparing the current fair value of each
reporting unit with its carrying value. If the fair value is in excess of the carrying value, then
the reporting unit’s goodwill is considered not to be impaired. If the fair value is less than the
carrying value, then an impairment is recognized for the amount by which the reporting unit’s
carrying value exceeds its fair value, up to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
The Firm uses the reporting units’ allocated capital plus goodwill and other intangible assets as a
proxy for the carrying values of equity for the reporting units in the goodwill impairment testing.
Reporting unit equity is determined on a similar basis as the allocation of capital to the LOBs which
takes into consideration a variety of factors including capital levels of similarly rated peers and
applicable regulatory capital requirements. LOB’s allocated capital levels are incorporated into the
Firm’s annual budget process, which is reviewed by the Firm’s Board of Directors and Operating
Committee. The primary method the Firm uses to estimate the fair value of its reporting units is the
income approach. This approach projects cash flows for the forecast period and uses the perpetuity
growth method to calculate terminal values. These cash flows and terminal values, which are based on
the reporting units’ annual budgets and forecasts are then discounted using an appropriate discount
rate. The discount rate used for each reporting unit represents an estimate of the cost of equity for
that reporting unit and is determined considering the Firm’s overall estimated cost of equity
(estimated using the Capital Asset Pricing Model), as adjusted for the risk characteristics specific
to each reporting unit (for example, for higher levels of risk or uncertainty associated with the
business or management’s forecasts and assumptions). To assess the reasonableness of the discount
rates used for each reporting unit, management compares the discount rate to the estimated cost of
equity for publicly traded institutions with similar businesses and risk characteristics. In
addition, the weighted average cost of equity (aggregating the various reporting units) is compared
with the Firm’s overall estimated cost of equity for reasonableness. The valuations derived from the
discounted cash flow analysis are then compared with market-based trading and transaction multiples
for relevant competitors. Trading and transaction comparables are used as general indicators to
assess the overall reasonableness of the estimated fair values, although precise conclusions
generally cannot be drawn due to the differences that
 280 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K 
naturally exist between the Firm’s businesses and competitor institutions. The Firm also takes into
consideration a comparison between the aggregate fair values of the Firm’s reporting units and
JPMorganChase’s market capitalization. In evaluating this comparison, the Firm considers several
factors, including (i) a control premium that would exist in a market transaction, (ii) factors
related to the level of execution risk that would exist at the Firmwide level that do not exist at
the reporting unit level and (iii) short-term market volatility and other factors that do not
directly affect the value of individual reporting units. Unanticipated declines in business
performance, increases in credit losses, increases in capital requirements, as well as deterioration
in economic or market conditions, adverse regulatory or legislative changes or increases in the
estimated market cost of equity, could cause the estimated fair values of the Firm’s reporting units
to decline in the future, which could result in a material impairment loss to earnings in a future
period related to some portion of the associated goodwill. Mortgage servicing rights MSRs represent
the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing servicing activities for others. The fair
value considers estimated future servicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to
service the loans, and generally declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received,
effectively amortizing the MSR asset against contractual servicing and ancillary fee income. MSRs are
either purchased from third parties or recognized upon sale or securitization of mortgage loans if
servicing is retained. As permitted by U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to account for its MSRs at
fair value. The Firm treats its MSRs as a single class of servicing assets based on the availability
of market inputs used to measure the fair value of its MSR asset and its treatment of MSRs as one
aggregate pool for risk management purposes. The Firm estimates the fair value of MSRs using an
option-adjusted spread (“OAS”) model, which projects MSR cash flows over multiple interest rate
scenarios in conjunction with the Firm’s prepayment model, and then discounts these cash flows at
risk-adjusted rates. The model considers portfolio characteristics, contractually specified servicing
fees, prepayment assumptions, delinquency rates, costs to service, late charges and other ancillary
revenue, and other economic factors. The Firm compares fair value estimates and assumptions to
observable market data where available, and also considers recent market activity and actual
portfolio experience.
 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K 281 
 Notes to consolidated financial statements 
The fair value of MSRs is sensitive to changes in interest rates, including their effect on
prepayment speeds. MSRs typically decrease in value when interest rates decline because declining
interest rates tend to increase prepayments and therefore reduce the expected life of the net
servicing cash flows that comprise the MSR asset. Conversely, securities (e.g., mortgage-backed
securities), and certain derivatives (e.g., those for which the Firm receives fixed-rate interest
payments) increase in value when interest rates decline. JPMorganChase uses combinations of
derivatives and securities to manage the risk of changes in the fair value of MSRs. The intent is to
offset any interest-rate related changes in the fair value of MSRs with changes in the fair value of
the related risk management instruments.

these servicer advances is minimal because reimbursement of the advances is typically senior to all
cash payments to investors. In addition, the Firm maintains the right to stop payment to investors if
the collateral is insufficient to cover the advance. However, certain of these servicer advances may
not be recoverable if they were not made in accordance with applicable rules and agreements.

Changes in fair value based on variations in
assumptions generally cannot be easily
extrapolated, because the relationship of the
change in the assumptions to the change in fair
value are often highly interrelated and may not
be linear. In the following table, the effect
that a change in a particular assumption may
have on the fair value is calculated without
changing any other assumption. In reality,
changes in one factor may result in changes in
another, which would either magnify or
counteract the impact of the initial change.
The table below outlines the key economic
assumptions used to determine the fair value of
the Firm’s MSRs at December 31, 2024 and 2023,

Other intangible assets The Firm’s finite-lived
and indefinite-lived other intangible assets are
initially recorded at their fair value primarily
upon completion of a business combination.
Subsequently, the Firm’s finite-lived intangible
assets, including core deposit intangibles,
customer relationship intangibles, and certain
other intangible assets, are amortized over
their useful lives, estimated based on the
expected future economic benefits to the Firm of
the intangible asset. The Firm’s intangible
assets with indefinite lives, such as asset
management contracts, are not subject to
amortization and are assessed periodically for
impairment. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023,
the gross carrying values of other intangible
assets were $ 3.8billion and $ 4.2billion,
respectively, and the accumulated amortization
was $ 879million and $ 994million, respectively.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the net
carrying values consist of finite-lived
intangible assets of $ 1.7billion and $
2.0billion, respectively, as well as indefinite-
lived intangible assets, which are not subject
to amortization, of $ 1.2billion at both
periods. As of December 31, 2024, other
intangible assets reflected core deposit and
certain wealth management customer relationship
intangibles related to the First Republic
acquisition, and asset management contracts
related to the Firm’s acquisition of the
remaining 51% interest in CIFM. Refer to Note 34
for additional information on the First Republic
acquisition. For the years ended December 31,
2024 and 2023, amortization expense was $
339million and $ 315million, respectively.

Impairment testing The Firm’s finite-lived and indefinite-lived other intangible assets are assessed
for impairment annually or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset
might be impaired. Once the Firm determines that an impairment exists for an intangible asset, the
impairment is recognized in other expense.

Note 16 – Premises and equipment
Premises and equipment includes land carried at
cost, as well as buildings, leasehold
improvements, internal-use software and
furniture and equipment carried at cost less

internal-use software and furniture and
equipment.
JPMorganChase computes depreciation using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful
life for buildings and furniture and equipment.
The Firm depreciates leasehold improvements over
the lesser of the remainder of the lease term or
the estimated useful life. The Firm also
capitalizes certain costs associated with the
acquisition or development of internal-use
software. Once the software is ready for its
intended use, these costs are amortized on a
straight-line basis over the software’s expected
useful life. The estimated useful lives range
from 10to 50years for buildings and leasehold
improvements, and 3to 10years for internal-use
software and furniture and equipment.
Impairment is assessed when events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying value
of an asset may not be fully recoverable.

 Note 18 - Leases 
Firm as lessee At December 31, 2024, JPMorganChase and its subsidiaries were obligated under a number
of noncancellable leases, predominantly operating leases for premises and equipment used primarily
for business purposes. These leases generally have terms of 20years or less, determined based on the
contractual maturity of the lease, and include periods covered by options to extend or terminate the
lease when the Firm is reasonably certain that it will exercise those options. All leases with lease
terms greater than twelve months are reported as a lease liability with a corresponding right-of-use
(“ROU”) asset. None of these lease agreements impose restrictions on the Firm’s ability to pay
dividends, engage in debt or equity financing transactions or enter into further lease agreements.
Certain of these leases contain escalation clauses that will increase rental payments based on
maintenance, utility and tax increases, which are non-lease components. The Firm elected not to
separate lease and non-lease components of a contract for its real estate leases. As such, real
estate lease payments represent payments on both lease and non-lease components. Operating lease
liabilities and ROU assets are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value
of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term. The future lease payments are discounted at
a rate that estimates the Firm’s collateralized borrowing rate for financing instruments of a similar
term and are included in accounts payable and other liabilities. The operating lease ROU assets,
predominantly included in premises and equipment, also include any lease prepayments made, plus
initial direct costs incurred, less any lease incentives received. Rental expense associated with
operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, and generally included
in occupancy expense in the Consolidated statements of income.

Firm as lessor The Firm provides auto and
equipment lease financing to its customers
through lease arrangements with lease terms that
may contain renewal, termination and/or purchase
options. The Firm’s lease financings are
predominantly auto operating leases. These
assets subject to operating leases are
recognized in other assets on the Firm’s
Consolidated balance sheets and are depreciated
on a straight-line basis over the lease term to
reduce the asset to its estimated residual
value. Depreciation expense is included in
technology, communications and equipment expense
in the Consolidated statements of income. The
Firm’s lease income is generally recognized on a
straight-line basis over the lease term and is
included in other income in the Consolidated
statements of income. On a periodic basis, the
Firm assesses leased assets for impairment, and
if the carrying amount of the leased asset
exceeds the undiscounted cash flows from the
lease payments and the estimated residual value
upon disposition of the leased asset, an
impairment is recognized. The risk of loss on
auto and equipment leased assets relating to the
residual value of the leased assets is monitored
through projections of the asset residual values
at lease origination and periodic review of
residual values, and is mitigated through
arrangements with certain manufacturers or
lessees.

Also included amounts accounted for at fair value which were not material as of December 31, 2024 and
2023. Excluded short-term commercial paper and other short-term beneficial interests of $ 21.8billion
and $ 19.9billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
(f) The interest rates shown are the weighted average of contractual rates in effect at December 31,
2024 and 2023, respectively, including non-U.S. dollar fixed- and variable-rate issuances, which
excludes the effects of the associated derivative instruments used in hedge accounting relationships,
if applicable. The interest rates shown exclude structured notes accounted for at fair value.
(g) As of December 31, 2024, long-term debt in the aggregate of $ 297.1billion was redeemable at the
option of JPMorganChase, in whole or in part, prior to maturity, based on the terms specified in the
respective instruments.
(h) The aggregate carrying values of debt that matures in each of the five years subsequent to 2024
is $ 41.0billion in 2025, $ 64.5billion in 2026, $ 32.7billion in 2027, $ 93.4billion in 2028 and $
26.9billion in 2029.
 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K 289 
 Notes to consolidated financial statements 
The weighted-average contractual interest rates for total long-term debt excluding structured notes
accounted for at fair value were 3.82% and 3.65% as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In
order to modify exposure to interest rate and currency exchange rate movements, JPMorganChase
utilizes derivative instruments, primarily interest rate and cross-currency interest rate swaps, in
conjunction with some of its debt issuances. The use of these instruments modifies the Firm’s
interest expense on the associated debt. The modified weighted-average interest rates for total long-
term debt, including the effects of related derivative instruments, were 5.15% and 5.20% as of
December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. JPMorgan Chase & Co. has guaranteed certain long-term debt
of its subsidiaries, including structured notes. These guarantees rank pari passu with the Firm’s
other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The amount of such guaranteed long-term debt and
structured notes was $ 41.2billion and $ 41.1billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The
Firm’s unsecured debt does not contain requirements that would call for an acceleration of payments,
maturities or changes in the structure of the existing debt, provide any limitations on future
borrowings or require additional collateral, based on unfavorable changes in the Firm’s credit
ratings, financial ratios, earnings or stock price.

 Note 21 – Preferred stock 
At December 31, 2024 and 2023, JPMorganChase was authorized to issue 200million shares of preferred
stock, in one or more series, with a par value of $ 1per share. In the event of a liquidation or
dissolution of the Firm, JPMorganChase’s preferred stock then outstanding takes precedence over the
Firm’s common stock with respect to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets.
The following is a summary of JPMorganChase’s non-cumulative preferred stock outstanding as of
December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the quarterly dividend declarations for the years ended December 31,
2024, 2023 and 2022.

On June 28, 2024, the Firm announced that its
Board of Directors had authorized a new $
30billion common share repurchase program,
effective July 1, 2024. Through June 30, 2024,
the Firm was authorized to purchase up to $
30billion of common shares under its previously-
approved common share repurchase program that
was announced on April 13, 2022.
The following table sets forth the Firm’s
repurchases of common stock for the years ended
December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.

(a) Excludes excise tax and commissions. As part
of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, a 1%
excise tax is imposed on net share repurchases
commencing January 1, 2023.
(b) In the second half of 2022, the Firm
temporarily suspended share repurchases, which
it resumed in the first quarter of 2023 under
its common share repurchase program.
The Board of Directors’ authorization to
repurchase common shares is utilized at
management’s discretion. The $ 30billion common
share repurchase program approved by the Board
of Directors does not establish specific price
targets or timetables. Management determines the
amount and timing of common share repurchases
based on various factors, including market
conditions; legal and regulatory considerations
affecting the amount and timing of repurchase
activity; the Firm’s capital position (taking
into account goodwill and intangibles); organic
capital generation; current and proposed future
capital requirements; and other investment
opportunities. The amount of common shares that
the Firm repurchases in any period may be
substantially more or less than the amounts
estimated or actually repurchased in prior
periods, reflecting the dynamic nature of the
decision-making process. The Firm’s common share
repurchases may be suspended by management at
any time; and may be executed through open
market purchases or privately negotiated
transactions, or utilizing Rule 10b5-1 plans,
which are written trading plans that the Firm
may enter into from time to time under Rule
10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
and which allow the Firm to repurchase its
common shares during periods when it may
otherwise not be repurchasing common shares —
for example, during internal trading blackout
periods. As of December 31, 2024, approximately
58.8million shares of common stock were reserved
for issuance under various employee incentive,
compensation, option and stock purchase plans,
and directors’ compensation plans.

 Notes to consolidated financial statements 
 Note 23 – Earnings per share 
Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is calculated using the two-class method. Under the two-class
method, all earnings (distributed and undistributed) are allocated to common stock and participating
securities. JPMorganChase grants RSUs under its share-based compensation programs, predominantly all
of which entitle recipients to receive nonforfeitable dividends during the vesting period on a basis
equivalent to dividends paid to holders of the Firm’s common stock. These unvested RSUs meet the
definition of participating securities based on their respective rights to receive nonforfeitable
dividends, and they are treated as a separate class of securities in computing basic EPS.
Participating securities are not included as incremental shares in computing diluted EPS; refer to
Note 9 for additional information. Diluted EPS incorporates the potential impact of contingently
issuable shares, including awards which require future service as a condition of delivery of the
underlying common stock. Diluted EPS is calculated under both the two-class and treasury stock
methods, and the more dilutive amount is reported. For each of the periods presented in the table
below, diluted EPS calculated under the two-class method was more dilutive.
The following table presents the calculation of
net income applicable to common stockholders and
basic and diluted EPS for the years ended
December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.

(d) The pre-tax amounts are primarily recorded in noninterest revenue, net interest income and
compensation expense in the Consolidated statements of income.
(e) During the year ended December 31, 2022, a remeasurement of the Firm’s U.S. principal defined
benefit plan in the third quarter, was required as a result of a pension settlement. The

 Notes to consolidated financial statements 
 Note 25 – Income taxes 
JPMorganChase and its eligible subsidiaries file
a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return.
JPMorganChase uses the asset and liability
method to provide for income taxes on all
transactions recorded in the Consolidated
Financial Statements. This method requires that
income taxes reflect the expected future tax
consequences of temporary differences between
the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities
for book and tax purposes. Accordingly, a
deferred tax asset or liability for each
temporary difference is determined based on the
tax rates that the Firm expects to be in effect
when the underlying items of income and expense
are realized. JPMorganChase’s expense for income
taxes includes the current and deferred portions
of that expense. A valuation allowance is
established to reduce deferred tax assets to the
amount the Firm expects to realize. Due to the
inherent complexities arising from the nature of
the Firm’s businesses, and from conducting
business and being taxed in a substantial number
of jurisdictions, significant judgments and
estimates are required to be made. Agreement of
tax liabilities between JPMorganChase and the
many tax jurisdictions in which the Firm files
tax returns may not be finalized for several
years. Thus, the Firm’s final tax-related assets
and liabilities may ultimately be different from
those currently reported. Effective January 1,
2024, the Firm adopted updates to the Accounting
for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using
the Proportional Amortization Method guidance,
under the modified retrospective method. Refer
to Notes 1, 6 and 14 for additional information.

effect associated with the Firm’s adoption of
the Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit
Structures Using the Proportional Amortization
Method guidance. For the year ended December 31,
2023, stockholders’ equity reflected the tax
effect associated with the Firm’s adoption of

respective adoptions were recognized in retained
earnings. Refer to Note 1, 6 and 14 for further
information.

JPMorganChase has recorded deferred tax assets of $ 352million at December 31, 2024 in connection
with tax attribute carryforwards. State and local capital loss carryforwards were $ 914million, U.S.
federal NOL carryforwards were $ 496million, non-U.S. NOL carryforwards were $ 958million, and other
U.S. federal tax attributes were $ 111million. If not utilized, a portion of the U.S. federal NOL
carryforwards and other U.S. federal tax attributes will expire between 2026 and 2036 whereas others
have an unlimited carryforward period. Similarly, certain non-U.S. NOL carryforwards will expire
between 2026 and 2041 whereas others have an unlimited carryforward period. The state and local
capital loss carryforwards will expire in 2026. The valuation allowance at December 31, 2024, was
predominantly driven by certain non-U.S. deferred tax assets, including NOL carryforwards.

Unrecognized tax benefits
At December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022,
JPMorganChase’s unrecognized tax benefits,
excluding related interest expense and
penalties, were $ 6.2billion, $ 5.4billion and $
5.0billion, respectively, of which $ 4.4billion,
$ 3.9billion and $ 3.8billion, respectively, if
recognized, would reduce the annual effective
tax rate. Included in the amount of unrecognized
tax benefits are certain items that would not
affect the effective tax rate if they were
recognized in the Consolidated statements of
income. These unrecognized items include the tax
effect of certain temporary differences, the
portion of gross state and local unrecognized
tax benefits that would be offset by the benefit
from associated U.S. federal income tax
deductions, and the portion of gross non-U.S.
unrecognized tax benefits that would have
offsets in other jurisdictions. JPMorganChase
evaluates the need for changes in unrecognized
tax benefits based on its anticipated tax return
filing positions as part of its U.S. federal and
state and local tax returns. In addition, the
Firm is presently under audit by a number of
taxing authorities, most notably by the Internal
Revenue Service, as summarized in the Tax
examination status table below. The evaluation
of unrecognized tax benefits as well as the
potential for audit settlements make it
reasonably possible that over the next 12 months
the gross balance of unrecognized tax benefits
may increase or decrease by as much as
approximately $ 2.4billion. The change in the
unrecognized tax benefit would result in a
payment or income statement recognition.
The following table presents a reconciliation of
the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized
tax benefits.

the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, the
Firm had accrued $ 1.7billion and $ 1.6billion,
respectively, for income tax-related interest
and penaltie s.

Note 26 – Restricted cash, other restricted
assets and intercompany funds transfers
Restricted cash and other restricted assets
Certain of the Firm’s cash and other assets are
restricted as to withdrawal or usage. These
restrictions are imposed by various regulatory
authorities based on the particular activities
of the Firm’s subsidiaries.
The business of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is
subject to examination and regulation by the
OCC. The Bank is a member of the U.S. Federal
Reserve System, and its deposits in the U.S. are
insured by the FDIC, subject to applicable
limits.
The Firm is required to maintain cash reserves
at certain non-US central banks.
The Firm is also subject to rules and
regulations established by other U.S. and non
U.S. regulators. As part of its compliance with
the respective regulatory requirements, the
Firm’s broker-dealer activities are subject to
certain restrictions on cash and other assets.
The following table presents the components of
the Firm’s restricted cash:

 customers

 ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── 
 Total restricted cash(a) $ 27.5 $ 19.6 
(a) Comprises $ 26.1billion and $ 18.2billion in
deposits with banks, and $ 1.4billion and $
1.4billion in cash and due from banks on the
Consolidated balance sheets as of December 31,
2024 and 2023, respectively.
Also, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Firm had the following other restricted assets:
• Cash and securities pledged with clearing organizations for the benefit of customers of $
40.7billion and $ 40.5billion, respectively.
• Securities with a fair value of $ 26.8billion and $ 20.5billion, respectively, were also restricted
in relation to customer activity.
Intercompany funds transfers Restrictions imposed by U.S. federal law prohibit JPMorgan Chase Bank,
N.A., and its subsidiaries, from lending to JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“Parent Company”) and certain of
its affiliates unless the loans are secured in specified amounts. Such secured loans provided by any
banking subsidiary to the Parent Company or to any particular affiliate, together with certain other
transactions with such affiliate (collectively referred to as “covered transactions”), must be made
on terms and conditions that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices. In addition,
unless collateralized with cash or US Government debt obligations, covered transactions are generally
limited to 10% of the banking subsidiary’s total capital, as determined by the risk-based capital
guidelines; the aggregate amount of covered transactions between any banking subsidiary and all of
its affiliates is limited to 20% of the banking subsidiary’s total capital. The Parent Company’s two
principal subsidiaries are JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and JPMorgan Chase Holdings LLC, an intermediate
holding company (the “IHC”). The IHC generally holds the stock of JPMorganChase’s subsidiaries other
than JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its subsidiaries. The IHC also owns other assets and provides
intercompany loans to the Parent Company. The Parent Company is obligated to contribute to the IHC
substantially all the net proceeds received from securities issuances (including issuances of senior
and subordinated debt securities and of preferred and common stock). The principal sources of income
and funding for the Parent Company are dividends from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and dividends and
extensions of credit from the IHC. In addition to dividend restrictions set forth in statutes and
regulations, the Federal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC have authority under the Financial
Institutions Supervisory Act to prohibit or to limit the payment of dividends by the banking
organizations they supervise, including the Parent Company and its subsidiaries that are banks or
bank holding companies, if, in the banking regulator’s opinion, payment of a dividend would
constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the banking
organization. The IHC is prohibited from paying dividends or extending credit to the Parent Company
if certain capital or liquidity “thresholds” are breached or if limits are otherwise imposed by the
Parent Company’s management or Board of Directors. At January 1, 2025, the Parent Company’s banking
subsidiaries could pay, in the aggregate, approximately $ 15.5billion in dividends to their
respective bank holding companies without the prior approval of their relevant banking regulators.
The capacity to pay dividends in 2025 will be supplemented by the banking subsidiaries’ earnings
during the year.

 Notes to consolidated financial statements 
 Note 27 – Regulatory capital 
The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements, including well-capitalized standards, for the
Firm as a consolidated financial holding company. The OCC establishes similar minimum capital
requirements and standards for the Firm’s principal IDI subsidiary, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The
capital rules under Basel III establish minimum capital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards
for large and internationally active U.S. bank holding companies and banks, including the Firm and
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Under the rules currently in effect, two comprehensive approaches are
prescribed for calculating RWA: a standardized approach (“Basel III Standardized”), and an advanced
approach (“Basel III Advanced”). For each of these risk-based capital ratios, the capital adequacy of
the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is evaluated against the lower of the Standardized or Advanced
approaches compared to their respective regulatory capital ratio requirements. The three components
of regulatory capital under the Basel III rules and their primary drivers are as illustrated below:
Under the risk-based capital and leverage-based guidelines of the Federal Reserve, JPMorgan Chase &
Co. is required to maintain minimum ratios for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital, Total capital, Tier 1
leverage and the SLR. Failure to meet these minimum requirements could cause the Federal Reserve to
take action. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is also subject to these capital requirements established by
its primary regulators .
The following table presents the risk-based
regulatory capital ratio requirements and well-
capitalized ratios to which the Firm and
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. were subject as of
December 31, 2024 and 2023.

regulatory capital ratio requirements applicable
to the Firm. The CET1, Tier 1 and Total capital
ratio requirements each include a respective
minimum requirement plus a GSIB surcharge of
4.5% as calculated under Method 2; plus a 3.3%
SCB for Basel III Standardized ratios and a
fixed 2.5% capital conservation buffer for Basel
III Advanced ratios. The countercyclical buffer
is currently set to 0% by the federal banking
agencies. (b) For the period ended December 31,
2023, the CET1, Tier 1, and Total capital ratio
requirements under Basel III Standardized
applicable to the Firm were 11.4%, 12.9%, and
14.9%, respectively; the Basel III Advanced
CET1, Tier 1, and Total capital ratio
requirements applicable to the Firm were 11.0%,
12.5%, and 14.5%, respectively. (c) Represents
requirements for JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The
CET1, Tier 1 and Total capital ratio
requirements include a fixed capital
conservation buffer requirement of 2.5% that is
applicable to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A. is not subject to the GSIB
surcharge. (d) Represents requirements for bank
holding companies pursuant to regulations issued
by the Federal Reserve. (e) Represents
requirements for JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.

CECL Regulatory Capital Transition Beginning January 1, 2022, the $ 2.9billion CECL capital benefit,
provided by the Federal Reserve in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, is being phased out at 25% per
year over a three-year period. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Firm’s CET1 capital reflected
the remaining benefit of $ 720million and $ 1.4billion, respectively, associated with the CECL
capital transition provisions. Similarly, as of January 1, 2024, the Firm has phased out 75% of the
other CECL capital transition provisions which impacted Tier 2 capital, adjusted average assets,
total leverage exposure and RWA, as applicable.
The following tables present risk-based capital metrics under both the Basel III Standardized and
Basel III Advanced approaches and leverage-based capital metrics for JPMorgan Chase & Co. and
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and JPMorgan Chase

 Note 28 – Off–balance sheet lending-related 
financial instruments, guarantees, and
other commitments
JPMorganChase provides lending-related financial instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees) to
address the financing needs of its customers and clients. The contractual amount of these financial
instruments represents the maximum possible credit risk to the Firm should the customer or client
draw upon the commitment or the Firm be required to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and
should the customer or client subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of the contract.
Most of these commitments and guarantees have historically been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or
expired without being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the total contractual amount of
these instruments is not, in the Firm’s view, representative of its expected future credit exposure
or funding requirements. To provide for expected credit losses in wholesale and certain consumer
lending-related commitments, an allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments is
maintained. Refer to Note 13 for further information regarding the allowance for credit losses on
lending-related commitments. The following table summarizes the contractual amounts and carrying
values of off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments
at December 31, 2024 and 2023. The amounts in the table below for credit card, home equity and
certain scored business banking lending-related commitments represent the total available credit for
these products. The Firm has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines of
credit for these commitments will be utilized at the same time. The Firm can reduce or cancel these
commitments, in accordance with the contract, or to the extent otherwise permitted by law, including
when there has been a demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness of the borrower or significant
decrease in the value of underlying property.

Investments in Tax Credit Structures guidance effective January 1, 2024.
(h) For lending-related products, the carrying value includes the allowance for lending-related
commitments and the guarantee liability; for derivative-related products, and lending-related
commitments for which the fair value option was elected, the carrying value represents the fair
value.
(i) For lending-related commitments, the carrying value also includes fees and any purchase discounts
or premiums that are deferred and recognized in accounts payable and other liabilities on the
Consolidated balance sheets. Deferred amounts for revolving commitments and commitments not expected
to fund, are amortized to lending- and deposit-related fees on a straight line basis over the
commitment period. For all other commitments the deferred amounts remain deferred until the
commitment funds or is sold.
(j) As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, includes fair value adjustments associated with First Republic

 Notes to consolidated financial statements 
Other unfunded commitments to extend credit Other unfunded commitments to extend credit generally
consist of commitments for working capital and general corporate purposes, extensions of credit to
support commercial paper facilities and bond financings in the event that those obligations cannot be
remarketed to new investors, as well as committed liquidity facilities to clearing organizations. The
Firm also issues commitments under multipurpose facilities which could be drawn upon in several
forms, including the issuance of a standby letter of credit. Guarantees U.S. GAAP requires that a
guarantor recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability in an amount equal to the fair
value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. U.S. GAAP defines a guarantee as a
contract that contingently requires the guarantor to pay the guaranteed party based upon: (a) changes
in an underlying asset, liability or equity security of the guaranteed party; or (b) a third party’s
failure to perform under a specified agreement. The Firm considers the following off–balance sheet
arrangements to be guarantees under U.S. GAAP: standby letters of credit and other financial
guarantees, securities lending indemnifications, certain indemnification agreements included within
third-party contractual arrangements, certain derivative contracts and the guarantees under the
sponsored member repo program. As required by U.S. GAAP, the Firm initially records guarantees at the
inception date fair value of the non-contingent obligation assumed (e.g., the amount of consideration
received or the net present value of the premium receivable). For these obligations, the Firm records
this fair value amount in other liabilities with an offsetting entry recorded in cash (for premiums
received), or other assets (for premiums receivable). Any premium receivable recorded in other assets
is reduced as cash is received under the contract, and the fair value of the liability recorded at
inception is amortized into income as lending and deposit-related fees over the life of the guarantee
contract. The lending-related contingent obligation is recognized based on expected credit losses in
addition to, and separate from, any non-contingent obligation. Non-lending-related contingent
obligations are recognized when the liability becomes probable and reasonably estimable. These
obligations are not recognized if the estimated amount is less than the carrying amount of any non-
contingent liability recognized at inception (adjusted for any amortization). Examples of non-
lending-related contingent obligations include indemnifications provided in sales agreements, where a
portion of the sale proceeds is allocated to the guarantee, which adjusts the gain or loss that would
otherwise result from the transaction. For these indemnifications, the initial liability is amortized
to income as the Firm’s risk is reduced (i.e., over time or when the indemnification expires). The
contractual amount and carrying value of guarantees and indemnifications are included in the table on
page 303. For additional information on the guarantees, see below. Standby letters of credit and
other financial guarantees Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees are conditional
lending commitments issued by the Firm to guarantee the performance of a client or customer to a
third party under certain arrangements, such as commercial paper facilities, bond financings,
acquisition financings, trade financings and similar transactions.
The following table summarizes the contractual amount and carrying value of standby letters of credit
and other financial guarantees and other letters of credit arrangements as of December 31, 2024 and
2023.

Securities lending indemnifications Through the
Firm’s securities lending program,
counterparties’ securities, via custodial and
non-custodial arrangements, may be lent to third
parties. As part of this program, the Firm
provides an indemnification in the lending
agreements which protects the lender against the
failure of the borrower to return the lent
securities. To minimize its liability under
these indemnification agreements, the Firm
obtains cash or other highly liquid collateral
with a market value exceeding 100% of the value
of the securities on loan from the borrower.
Collateral is marked to market daily to help
assure that collateralization is adequate.
Additional collateral is called from the
borrower if a shortfall exists, or collateral
may be released to the borrower in the event of
overcollateralization. If a borrower defaults,
the Firm would use the collateral held to
purchase replacement securities in the market or
to credit the lending client or counterparty
with the cash equivalent thereof. The cash
collateral held by the Firm may be invested on
behalf of the client in indemnified resale
agreements, whereby the Firm indemnifies the
client against the loss of principal invested.
To minimize its liability under these
agreements, the Firm obtains collateral with a
market value exceeding 100% of the principal
invested. Derivatives qualifying as guarantees
The Firm transacts in certain derivative
contracts that have the characteristics of a
guarantee under U.S. GAAP. These contracts
include written put options that require the
Firm to purchase assets upon exercise by the
option holder at a specified price by a
specified date in the future. The Firm may enter
into written put option contracts in order to
meet client needs, or for other trading
purposes. The terms of written put options are
typically five yearsor less. Derivatives deemed
to be guarantees also includes stable value
contracts, commonly referred to as “stable value
products”, that require the Firm to make a
payment of the difference between the market
value and the book value of a counterparty’s
reference portfolio of assets in the event that
market value is less than book value and certain
other conditions have been met. Stable value
products are transacted in order to allow
investors to realize investment returns with
less volatility than an unprotected portfolio.
These contracts are typically longer-term or may
have no stated maturity, but allow the Firm to
elect to terminate the contract under certain
conditions. The notional value of derivative
guarantees generally represents the Firm’s
maximum exposure. However, exposure to certain
stable value products is contractually limited
to a substantially lower percentage of the
notional amount.
The fair value of derivative guarantees reflects
the probability, in the Firm’s view, of whether
the Firm will be required to perform under the
contract. The Firm reduces exposures to these
contracts by entering into offsetting
transactions, or by entering into contracts that
hedge the market risk related to the derivative
guarantees.
The following table summarizes the derivatives
qualifying as guarantees as of December 31, 2024
and 2023.

In addition to derivative contracts that meet
the characteristics of a guarantee, the Firm is
both a purchaser and seller of credit protection
in the credit derivatives market. Refer to Note
5 for a further discussion of credit
derivatives. Unsettled securities financing
agreements In the normal course of business, the
Firm enters into resale and securities borrowed
agreements. At settlement, these commitments
result in the Firm advancing cash to and
receiving securities collateral from the
counterparty. The Firm also enters into
repurchase and securities loaned agreements. At
settlement, these commitments result in the Firm
receiving cash from and providing securities
collateral to the counterparty. Such agreements
settle at a future date. These agreements
generally do not meet the definition of a
derivative, and therefore, are not recorded on
the Consolidated balance sheets until settlement
date. These agreements predominantly have
regular-way settlement terms. Refer to Note 11
for a further discussion of securities financing
agreements. Loan sales- and securitization-
related indemnifications Mortgage repurchase
liability In connection with the Firm’s mortgage
loan sale and securitization activities with
U.S. GSEs the Firm has made representations and
warranties that the loans sold meet certain
requirements, and that may require the Firm to
repurchase mortgage loans and/or indemnify the
loan purchaser if such representations and
warranties are breached by the Firm.
 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K 305 
 Notes to consolidated financial statements 
Private label securitizations The liability related to repurchase demands associated with private
label securitizations is separately evaluated by the Firm in establishing its litigation reserves.
Refer to Note 30 for additional information regarding litigation. Loans sold with recourse The Firm
provides servicing for mortgages and certain commercial lending products on both a recourse and
nonrecourse basis. In nonrecourse servicing, the principal credit risk to the Firm is the cost of
temporary servicing advances of funds (i.e., normal servicing advances). In recourse servicing, the
servicer agrees to share credit risk with the owner of the mortgage loans, such as Fannie Mae or
Freddie Mac or a private investor, insurer or guarantor. Losses on recourse servicing predominantly
occur when foreclosure sales proceeds of the property underlying a defaulted loan are less than the
sum of the outstanding principal balance, plus accrued interest on the loan and the cost of holding
and disposing of the underlying property. The Firm’s securitizations are predominantly nonrecourse,
thereby effectively transferring the risk of future credit losses to the purchaser of the mortgage-
backed securities issued by the trust. The unpaid principal balance of loans sold with recourse as
well as the carrying value of the related liability that the Firm has recorded in accounts payable
and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets, which is representative of the Firm’s view
of the likelihood it will have to perform under its recourse obligations, are disclosed in the table
on page 303. Other off-balance sheet arrangements Indemnification agreements – general In connection
with issuing securities to investors outside the U.S., the Firm may agree to pay additional amounts
to the holders of the securities in the event that, due to a change in tax law, certain types of
withholding taxes are imposed on payments on the securities. The terms of the securities may also
give the Firm the right to redeem the securities if such additional amounts are payable. The Firm may
also enter into indemnification clauses such as in connection with the licensing of software to
clients (“software licensees”) or when it sells a business or assets to a third party (“third-party
purchasers”), pursuant to which it indemnifies software licensees for claims of liability or damages
that may occur subsequent to the licensing of the software, or third-party purchasers for losses they
may incur due to actions taken by the Firm prior to the sale of the business or assets. It is
difficult to estimate the Firm’s maximum exposure under these indemnification arrangements, since
this would require an assessment of future changes in tax law and future claims that may be made
against the Firm that have not yet occurred. However, based on historical experience, management
expects the risk of loss to be remote. Merchant charge-backs Under the rules of payment networks, in
its role as a merchant acquirer, the Firm’s Merchant Services business in CIB Payments, retains a
contingent liability for disputed processed credit and debit card transactions that result in a
charge-back to the merchant. If a dispute is resolved in the cardholder’s favor, the Firm will
(through the cardholder’s issuing bank) credit or refund the amount to the cardholder and will charge
back the transaction to the merchant. If the Firm is unable to collect the amount from the merchant,
the Firm will bear the loss for the amount credited or refunded to the cardholder. The Firm mitigates
this risk by withholding future settlements, retaining cash reserve accounts or obtaining other
collateral. In addition, the Firm recognizes a valuation allowance that covers the payment or
performance risk related to charge-backs. Clearing Services – Client Credit Risk The Firm provides
clearing services for clients by entering into securities purchases and sales and derivative
contracts with CCPs, including ETDs such as futures and options, as well as OTC-cleared derivative
contracts. As a clearing member, the Firm stands behind the performance of its clients, collects cash
and securities collateral (margin) as well as any settlement amounts due from or to clients, and
remits them to the relevant CCP or client in whole or part. There are two types of margin: variation
margin is posted on a daily basis based on the value of clients’ derivative contracts and initial
margin is posted at inception of a derivative contract, generally on the basis of the potential
changes in the variation margin requirement for the contract. As a clearing member, the Firm is
exposed to the risk of nonperformance by its clients, but is not liable to clients for the
performance of the CCPs. Where possible, the Firm seeks to mitigate its risk to the client through
the collection of appropriate amounts of margin at inception and throughout the life of the
transactions. The Firm can also cease providing clearing services if clients do not adhere to their
obligations under the clearing agreement. In the event of nonperformance by a client, the Firm would
close out the client’s positions and access available margin. The CCP would utilize any margin it
holds to make itself whole, with any remaining shortfalls required to be paid by the Firm as a
clearing member.
 306 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K 
The Firm reflects its exposure to nonperformance risk of the client through the recognition of margin
receivables from clients and margin payables to CCPs; the clients’ underlying securities or
derivative contracts are not reflected in the Firm’s Consolidated Financial Statements. It is
difficult to estimate the Firm’s maximum possible exposure through its role as a clearing member, as
this would require an assessment of transactions that clients may execute in the future. However,
based upon historical experience, and the credit risk mitigants available to the Firm, management
believes it is unlikely that the Firm will have to make any material payments under these
arrangements and the risk of loss is expected to be remote. Refer to Note 5 for information on the
derivatives that the Firm executes for its own account and records in its Consolidated Financial
Statements. Exchange & Clearing House Memberships The Firm is a member of several securities and
derivative exchanges and clearing houses, both in the U.S. and other countries, and it provides
clearing services to its clients. Membership in some of these organizations requires the Firm to pay
a pro rata share of the losses incurred by the organization as a result of the default of another
member. Such obligations vary with different organizations. These obligations may be limited to the
amount (or a multiple of the amount) of the Firm’s contribution to the guarantee fund maintained by a
clearing house or exchange as part of the resources available to cover any losses in the event of a
member default. Alternatively, these obligations may also include a pro rata share of the residual
losses after applying the guarantee fund. Additionally, certain clearing houses require the Firm as a
member to pay a pro rata share of losses that may result from the clearing house’s investment of
guarantee fund contributions and initial margin, unrelated to and independent of the default of
another member. Generally a payment would only be required should such losses exceed the resources of
the clearing house or exchange that are contractually required to absorb the losses in the first
instance. In certain cases, it is difficult to estimate the Firm’s maximum possible exposure under
these membership agreements, since this would require an assessment of future claims that may be made
against the Firm that have not yet occurred. However, based on historical experience, management
expects the risk of loss to the Firm to be remote. Where the Firm’s maximum possible exposure can be
estimated, the amount is disclosed in the table on page 303, in the Exchange & clearing house
guarantees and commitments line. Sponsored member repo program The Firm acts as a sponsoring member
to clear eligible overnight and term resale and repurchase agreements through the Government
Securities Division of the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (“FICC”) on behalf of clients that
become sponsored members under the FICC’s rules. The Firm also guarantees to the FICC the prompt and
full payment and performance of its sponsored member clients’ respective obligations under the FICC’s
rules. The Firm minimizes its liability under these guarantees by obtaining a security interest in
the cash or high-quality securities collateral that the clients place with the clearing house;
therefore, the Firm expects the risk of loss to be remote. The Firm’s maximum possible exposure,
without taking into consideration the associated collateral, is included in the Exchange & clearing
house guarantees and commitments line on page 303. Refer to Note 11 for additional information on
credit risk mitigation practices on resale agreements and the types of collateral pledged under
repurchase agreements. Guarantees of subsidiaries In the normal course of business, the Parent
Company may provide counterparties with guarantees of certain of the trading and other obligations of
its subsidiaries on a contract-by-contract basis, as negotiated with the Firm’s counterparties. The
obligations of the subsidiaries are included on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets or are
reflected as off-balance sheet commitments; therefore, the Parent Company has not recognized a
separate liability for these guarantees. The Firm believes that the occurrence of any event that
would trigger payments by the Parent Company under these guarantees is remote. The Parent Company has
guaranteed certain long-term debt and structured notes of its subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase
Financial Company LLC (“JPMFC”), a 100%-owned finance subsidiary. All securities issued by JPMFC are
fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Parent Company and no other subsidiary of the Parent
Company guarantees these securities. These guarantees, which rank pari passu with the Firm’s
unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness, are not included in the table on page 303 of this Note.
Refer to Note 20 for additional information.

 Note 29 – Pledged assets and collateral 
Pledged assets The Firm pledges financial assets
that it owns to maintain potential borrowing
capacity at discount windows with Federal
Reserve banks, various other central banks and
FHLBs. Additionally, the Firm pledges assets for
other purposes, including to collateralize
repurchase and other securities financing
agreements, to cover short sales and to
collateralize derivative contracts and deposits.
Certain of these pledged assets may be sold or
repledged or otherwise used by the secured
parties and are parenthetically identified on
the Consolidated balance sheets as assets
pledged.

 Note 30 – Litigation 
Contingencies
As of December 31, 2024, the Firm and its subsidiaries and affiliates are defendants or respondents
in numerous evolving legal proceedings, including private proceedings, public proceedings, government
investigations, regulatory enforcement matters, and the matters described below. The litigations
range from individual actions involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits with potentially
millions of class members. Investigations and regulatory enforcement matters involve both formal and
informal proceedings, by both governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations. These legal
proceedings are at varying stages of adjudication, arbitration or investigation, and involve each of
the Firm’s lines of business and several geographies and a wide variety of claims (including common
law tort and contract claims and statutory antitrust, securities and consumer protection claims),
some of which present novel legal theories. The Firm believes the estimate of the aggregate range of
reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves established, for its legal proceedings is from $
0to approximately $ 1.4billion at December 31, 2024. This estimated aggregate range of reasonably
possible losses was based upon information available as of that date for those proceedings in which
the Firm believes that an estimate of reasonably possible loss can be made. For certain matters, the
Firm does not believe that such an estimate can be made, as of that date. The Firm’s estimate of the
aggregate range of reasonably possible losses involves significant judgment, given: • the number,
variety and varying stages of the proceedings, including the fact that many are in preliminary
stages, • the existence in many such proceedings of multiple defendants, including the Firm, whose
share of liability (if any) has yet to be determined, • the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of
the proceedings, including issues regarding class certification and the scope of many of the claims,
and • the uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings, including where the Firm
has made assumptions concerning future rulings by the court or other adjudicator, or about the
behavior or incentives of adverse parties or regulatory authorities, and those assumptions prove to
be incorrect. In addition, the outcome of a particular proceeding may be a result which the Firm did
not take into account in its estimate because the Firm had deemed the likelihood of that outcome to
be remote. Accordingly, the Firm’s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses will
change from time to time, and actual losses may vary significantly. Set forth below are descriptions
of the Firm’s material legal proceedings. 1MDB Litigation . J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA was named as a
defendant in a civil litigation filed in May 2021 in Malaysia by 1Malaysia Development Berhad
(“1MDB”), a Malaysian state-owned and controlled investment fund. The claim alleges “dishonest
assistance” against J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA in relation to payments of $ 300million and $ 500million,
from 2009 and 2010, respectively, received from 1MDB and paid into an account at J.P. Morgan (Suisse)
SA held by 1MDB PetroSaudi Limited, a joint venture company between 1MDB and PetroSaudi Holdings
(Cayman) Limited. In March 2024, the Court upheld the Firm's challenge to the validity of service and
the Malaysian Court’s jurisdiction to hear the claim. That decision has been appealed by 1MDB. In
August 2023, the Court denied an application by 1MDB to discontinue its claim with permission to re-
file a new claim in the future. That decision was appealed by both 1MDB and the Firm, and an appeals
court is scheduled to hear both appeals in November 2025. In its appeal, the Firm seeks to prevent
any claim from continuing. In addition, in November 2023, the Federal Office of the Attorney General
(OAG) in Switzerland notified J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA that it is conducting an investigation into
possible criminal liability in connection with transactions arising from J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA’s
relationship with the 1MDB PetroSaudi joint venture and its related persons for the period September
2009 through August 2015. The OAG investigation is ongoing. Amrapali . India’s Enforcement
Directorate (“ED”) is investigating J.P. Morgan India Private Limited in connection with investments
made in 2010 and 2012 by twooffshore funds formerly managed by JPMorganChase entities into
residential housing projects developed by the Amrapali Group (“Amrapali”) relating to delays in
delivering or failure to deliver residential units. In August 2021, the ED issued an order fining
J.P. Morgan India Private Limited approximately $ 31.5million, and the Firm is appealing that order.
Relatedly, in July 2019, the Supreme Court of India issued an order making preliminary findings that
Amrapali and other parties, including unspecified JPMorganChase entities and the offshore funds that
had invested in the projects, violated certain criminal currency control and money laundering
provisions, and ordered the ED to conduct a further inquiry. The Firm is responding to and
cooperating with the inquiry. Foreign Exchange Investigations and Litigation. The Firm previously
reported settlements with certain government authorities relating to its foreign exchange (“FX”)
sales and trading activities and controls related to those activities. Among those resolutions, in
May 2015, the Firm pleaded guilty to a single violation of federal antitrust law. The Department of
Labor ("DOL") granted the Firm exemptions that permit the Firm and its
 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K 309 
 Notes to consolidated financial statements 
affiliates to continue to rely on the Qualified Professional Asset Manager exemption under the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”) through the ten-yeardisqualification period
following the antitrust plea. The only remaining FX-related governmental inquiry is a South Africa
Competition Commission matter which is currently pending before the South Africa Competition
Tribunal. With respect to civil litigation matters, some FX-related individual and putative class
actions filed outside the U.S., including in the U.K., Israel, the Netherlands, Brazil and Australia,
remain. In July 2023, the U.K. Court of Appeal overturned the Competition Appeal Tribunal's earlier
denial of a request for class certification on an opt-out basis. The defendants have appealed this
decision to the U.K. Supreme Court. In Israel, a settlement in principle has been reached on the
putative class action, which remains subject to court approval. Interchange Litigation . Groups of
merchants and retail associations filed a series of class action complaints alleging that Visa and
Mastercard, as well as certain banks, conspired to set the price of credit and debit card interchange
fees and enacted related rules in violation of antitrust laws. In September 2018, the parties settled
the class action seeking monetary relief, with the defendants collectively contributing approximately
$ 6.2billion. The settlement has been approved by the United States District Court for the Eastern
District of New York and affirmed on appeal. Based on the percentage of merchants that opted out of
the settlement, $ 700million has been returned to the defendants from the settlement escrow. A
separate class action seeking injunctive relief continues, and in September 2021, the District Court
granted plaintiffs’ motion for class certification in part, and denied the motion in part. In June
2024, the District Court denied preliminary approval of a settlement of the injunctive class action
in which Visa and Mastercard agreed to certain changes to their respective network rules and system-
wide reductions in interchange rates for U.S.-based merchants. The parties are considering next
steps. Of the merchants who opted out of the damages class settlement, certain merchants filed
individual actions raising similar allegations against Visa and Mastercard, as well as against the
Firm and other banks. While some of those actions remain pending, the defendants have reached
settlements with the merchants who opted out representing over 70% of the combined Mastercard-branded
and Visa-branded payment card sales volume. LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rate Investigations and
Litigation . JPMorganChase has responded to inquiries from various governmental agencies and entities
around the world relating primarily to the British Bankers Association’s (“BBA”) London Interbank
Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) for various currencies and the European Banking Federation’s Euro Interbank
Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”). The Swiss Competition Commission’s investigation relating to EURIBOR, to
which the Firm and one other bank remain subject, continues. The Firm appealed a December 2016
decision by the European Commission against the Firm and other banks finding an infringement of
European antitrust rules relating to EURIBOR. In December 2023, the European General Court annulled
the fine imposed by the European Commission, but exercised its discretion to re-impose a fine in an
identical amount. In March 2024, the Firm filed an appeal of this decision with the Court of Justice
of the European Union. In addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant along with other banks in
various individual and putative class actions related to benchmark rates, including U.S. dollar
LIBOR. In actions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR during the period that it was administered by the BBA,
the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York granted class certification of
antitrust claims related to bonds and interest rate swaps sold directly by the defendants, including
the Firm. The Firm has obtained dismissal of certain actions and resolved certain other actions, and
as to all remaining actions has moved for summary judgment. In addition, a lawsuit filed by a group
of individual plaintiffs asserting antitrust claims, alleging that the Firm and other defendants were
engaged in an unlawful agreement to set U.S. dollar LIBOR and conspired to monopolize the market for
LIBOR-based consumer loans and credit cards was dismissed in October 2023 and affirmed on appeal by
the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in December 2024. The Firm has resolved all
non-U.S. dollar LIBOR actions. Russian Litigation . The Firm is obligated to comply with
international sanctions laws, which mandate the blocking of certain assets. These laws apply when
assets associated with individuals, companies, products or services are within the scope of the
sanctions. The Firm has faced actual and threatened litigation in Russia seeking payments that the
Firm cannot make under, and is contractually excused from paying as a result of, relevant sanctions
laws. In claims involving the Firm and claims filed against other financial institutions, Russian
courts have disregarded the parties’ contractual agreements concerning forum selection and did not
recognize foreign sanctions laws as a basis for not making payment. Russian courts have entered
judgment against the Firm in a number of claims, including one for $ 439million, and a judgment has
been executed against assets held onshore by the Firm in Russia. The total amount of the judgments
exceeds the total amount of available assets that the Firm holds in Russia. The Firm continues to
appeal the Russian courts' decisions, and judgments may not be executed while on appeal. Russian
courts have also ordered interim freezes of Firm assets in Russia (including, among other things,
funds in bank accounts, securities, shares in authorized capital, and certain trademarks, of the
named defendants) pending a determination of
 310 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K 
certain underlying claims against the Firm. The Firm has challenged claims being pursued in the
Russian courts and related freeze orders in other jurisdictions provided for by the parties’
contractual forum selections. If further claims are enforced despite the actions taken by the Firm to
challenge the claims and orders and to seek the proper application of law, the Firm’s assets in
Russia could be seized in full, and certain client assets could also be seized, or the Firm could be
prevented from complying with its obligations. SEC Inquiries . In October 2024, the Firm entered into
settlements with the SEC to resolve inquiries related to, among other things, conflict disclosures
concerning the selection of portfolio managers and the timing of the Firm’s liquidation of shares
distributed in-kind to certain investment vehicles that invest in third-party managed private funds
and certain other matters. The resolutions required the Firm to pay a combined $ 151million in civil
penalties and voluntary payments to customers. The Firm continues to cooperate in connection with SEC
inquiries concerning the aggregation of accounts for fee billing and various other matters.
Shareholder Litigation . Several shareholder putative class actions, as well as shareholder
derivative actions purporting to act on behalf of the Firm, have been filed against the Firm, its
Board of Directors and certain of its current and former officers. Certain of these shareholder suits
relate to historical trading practices by former employees in the precious metals and U.S. treasuries
markets and related conduct which were the subject of the Firm’s resolutions with the DOJ, CFTC and
SEC in September 2020, and fiduciary activities that were separately the subject of a resolution
between JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the OCC in November 2020. One of these shareholder derivative
suits was filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York in May 2022, asserting breach of
fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment claims relating to the historical trading practices and related
conduct and fiduciary activities which were the subject of the resolutions described above. In
December 2022, the court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss this action in full, and in July 2023,
the plaintiff filed an appeal, which remains pending. A second shareholder derivative action relating
to the historical trading practices and related conduct was filed in the United States District Court
for the Eastern District of New York in December 2022. Defendants have moved to dismiss the
complaint. Zelle Network Litigation . In December 2024, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
(“CFPB”) filed a complaint against Early Warning Services, LLC (“EWS”), Bank of America, N.A., Wells
Fargo Bank, N.A. and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. in the United States District Court for the District
of Arizona. The CFPB alleges that EWS and the defendant banks have failed to take sufficient efforts
to prevent fraud on the Zelle network. The defendants will file a response to the complaint. * * * In
addition to the various legal proceedings discussed above, JPMorganChase and its subsidiaries are
named as defendants or are otherwise involved in a substantial number of other legal proceedings. The
Firm believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its currently
outstanding legal proceedings and it intends to defend itself vigorously. Additional legal
proceedings may be initiated from time to time in the future. The Firm has established reserves for
several hundred of its currently outstanding legal proceedings. In accordance with the provisions of
U.S. GAAP for contingencies, the Firm accrues for a litigation-related liability when it is probable
that such a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The
Firm evaluates its outstanding legal proceedings each quarter to assess its litigation reserves, and
makes adjustments in such reserves, upward or downward, as appropriate, based on management’s best
judgment after consultation with counsel. The Firm’s legal expense was $ 740million, $ 1.4billion and
$ 266million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. There is no
assurance that the Firm’s litigation reserves will not need to be adjusted in the future. In view of
the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal proceedings, particularly where the
claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages, or where the matters present novel legal
theories, involve a large number of parties or are in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannot
state with confidence what will be the eventual outcomes of the currently pending matters, the timing
of their ultimate resolution or the eventual losses, fines, penalties or consequences related to
those matters. JPMorganChase believes, based upon its current knowledge and after consultation with
counsel, consideration of the material legal proceedings described above and after taking into
account its current litigation reserves and its estimated aggregate range of possible losses, that
the other legal proceedings currently pending against it should not have a material adverse effect on
the Firm’s consolidated financial condition. The Firm notes, however, that in light of the
uncertainties involved in such proceedings, there is no assurance that the ultimate resolution of
these matters will not significantly exceed the reserves it has currently accrued or that a matter
will not have material reputational consequences. As a result, the outcome of a particular matter may
be material to JPMorganChase’s operating results for a particular period, depending on, among other
factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of JPMorganChase’s income for that
period.

 Note 31 – International operations 
The following table presents income statement and balance sheet-related information for JPMorganChase
by major international geographic area. The Firm defines international activities for purposes of
this footnote presentation as business transactions that involve clients residing outside of the
U.S., and the information presented below is based predominantly on the domicile of the client, the
location from which the client relationship is managed, booking location or the location of the
trading desk. However, many of the Firm’s U.S. operations serve international businesses. As the
Firm’s operations are highly integrated, estimates and subjective assumptions have been made to
apportion revenue and expense between U.S. and international operations. These estimates and
assumptions are consistent with the allocations used for the Firm’s segment reporting as set forth in
Note 32. The Firm’s long-lived assets for the periods presented are not considered by management to
be significant in relation to total assets. The majority of the Firm’s long-lived assets are located
in the U.S.

 Note 32 – Business segments & Corporate 
Business segment reorganization: Effective in the second quarter of 2024, the Firm reorganized its
reportable business segments by combining the former Corporate & Investment Bank and Commercial
Banking business segments to form one reportable segment, the Commercial & Investment Bank. As a
result of the reorganization, the Firm has three reportable business segments – Consumer & Community
Banking, Commercial & Investment Bank, and Asset & Wealth Management – with the remaining activities
in Corporate. Adoption of accounting standard — Segment Reporting — Improvements to Reportable
Segment Disclosures: This guidance was adopted retrospectively for the Firm’s annual Consolidated
Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2024. The adoption of this guidance requires
additional reportable segment disclosures, primarily relating to significant segment expenses and the
chief operating decision maker (“CODM”). Adoption of this guidance did not result in changes to the
identification of the Firm’s reportable business segments, or of its CODM. The Firm is managed on an
LOB basis. The business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the
type of customer served, and they reflect the manner in which financial information is evaluated by
the Firm’s Operating Committee, whose members act collectively as the Firm’s CODM. Segment results
are presented on a managed basis. Refer to Segment & Corporate results in this footnote for a further
discussion of JPMorganChase’s reportable business segments and Corporate. The following is a
description of each of the Firm’s reportable business segments, and the products and services that
they provide to their respective client bases, as well as a description of Corporate activities.
Consumer & Community Banking Consumer & Community Banking offers products and services to consumers
and small businesses through bank branches, ATMs, digital (including mobile and online) and telephone
banking. CCB is organized into Banking & Wealth Management (including Consumer Banking, Business
Banking and J.P. Morgan Wealth Management), Home Lending (including Home Lending Production, Home
Lending Servicing and Real Estate Portfolios) and Card Services & Auto. Banking & Wealth Management
offers deposit, investment and lending products, cash management, payments and services. Home Lending
includes mortgage origination and servicing activities, as well as portfolios consisting of
residential mortgages and home equity loans. Card Services issues credit cards and offers travel
services. Auto originates and services auto loans and leases. Commercial & Investment Bank The
Commercial & Investment Bank is comprised of the Banking & Payments and Markets & Securities Services
businesses. These businesses offer investment banking, lending, payments, market-making, financing,
custody and securities products and services to a global base of corporate and institutional clients.
Banking & Payments offers products and services in all major capital markets, including advising on
corporate strategy and structure, capital-raising in equity and debt markets, and loan origination
and syndication. Banking & Payments also provides services that enable clients to manage payments
globally across liquidity and account solutions, commerce solutions, clearing, trade, and working
capital. Markets & Securities Services includes Markets, which is a global market-maker across

 Notes to consolidated financial statements 
Description of business segment reporting methodology Results of the reportable business segments are
intended to present each segment as if it were a stand-alone business. The management reporting
process that derives business segment results includes the allocation of certain income and expense
items. The Firm periodically assesses the assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications
used for segment reporting, and therefore further refinements may be implemented in future periods.
The Firm also assesses the level of capital required for each LOB on at least an annual basis. The
Firm’s LOBs also provide various business metrics which are utilized by the Firm and its investors
and analysts in assessing performance. Revenue sharing When business segments or businesses within
each segment join efforts to sell products and services to the Firm’s clients and customers, the
participating businesses may agree to share revenue from those transactions. Revenue is generally
recognized in the segment responsible for the related product or service, with allocations to the
other segments or businesses involved in the transaction. The segment and business results reflect
these revenue-sharing agreements. Expense allocation Where business segments use services provided by
Corporate support units, or another business segment, the costs of those services are allocated to
the respective business segments. The expense is generally allocated based on the actual cost and use
of services provided. In contrast, certain costs and investments related to Corporate that are not
currently utilized by any LOB are not allocated to the business segments and are retained in
Corporate. Expense retained in Corporate generally includes costs that would not be incurred if the
segments were stand-alone businesses, and other items not solely aligned with a particular reportable
business segment. Funds transfer pricing Funds transfer pricing (“FTP”) is the process by which the
Firm allocates interest income and expense to the LOBs and Other Corporate and transfers the primary
interest rate risk and liquidity risk to Treasury and CIO. The funds transfer pricing process
considers the interest rate and liquidity risk characteristics of assets and liabilities and off-
balance sheet products. Periodically, the methodology and assumptions utilized in the FTP process are
adjusted to reflect economic conditions and other factors, which may impact the allocation of net
interest income to the segments. Effective in the fourth quarter of 2024, the Firm updated its FTP
with respect to consumer deposits, which resulted in an increase in the funding benefit reflected
within CCB’s net interest income that is fully offset in Corporate, with no effect on the Firm’s net
interest income. Foreign exchange risk Foreign exchange risk is transferred from the LOBs and Other
Corporate to Treasury and CIO for certain revenues and expenses. Treasury and CIO manages these risks
centrally and reports the impact of foreign exchange rate movements related to the transferred risk
in its results. Debt expense and preferred stock dividend allocation As part of the FTP process,
almost all of the cost of the credit spread component of outstanding unsecured long-term debt and
preferred stock dividends is allocated to the reportable business segments, while the balance of the
cost is retained in Corporate. The methodology to allocate the cost of unsecured long-term debt and
preferred stock dividends to the business segments is aligned with the relevant regulatory capital
requirements and funding needs of the LOBs, as applicable. The allocated cost of unsecured long-term
debt is included in a business segment’s net interest income, and net income is reduced by preferred
stock dividends, to arrive at a business segment’s net income applicable to common equity. Capital
allocation Each LOB and Corporate is allocated capital by taking into consideration a variety of
factors including capital levels of similarly rated peers and applicable regulatory capital
requirements. ROE is measured and internal targets for expected returns are established as key
measures of an LOB’s performance. The Firm’s current equity allocation methodology incorporates Basel
III Standardized RWA and the GSIB surcharge, both under rules currently in effect, as well as a
simulation of capital depletion in a severe stress environment. At least annually, the assumptions,
judgments and methodologies used to allocate capital are reassessed and, as a result, the capital
allocated to the LOBs and Corporate may change.

Segment & Corporate results
The following table provides a summary of results for the Firm’s reportable business segments and
Corporate activities as of or for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, on a managed
basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes
certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm as a whole (and for each of the
reportable business segments and Corporate) on an FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments
that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis
comparable to taxable investments and securities. This allows management to assess the comparability
of revenue from year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding
income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense/(benefit). These
adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the each of the
LOBs and Corporate. The Operating Committee reviews segment results including net interest income,
noninterest revenue, noninterest expense, provision for credit losses and net income on a managed
basis. The Operating Committee uses these measures to evaluate segment performance and to make key
operating decisions, including resource and capital allocations.

 Note 34 – Business combinations 
On May 1, 2023, JPMorganChase acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of First
Republic Bank (the "First Republic acquisition") from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
(“FDIC”), as receiver. The acquisition resulted in a bargain purchase gain, which represents the
excess of the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired above the purchase price. The Firm has
determined that this acquisition constitutes a business combination under U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, the
initial recognition of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were generally measured at their
estimated fair values as of May 1, 2023. The determination of those fair values required management
to make certain market-based assumptions about expected future cash flows, discount rates and other
valuation inputs at the time of the acquisition. The Firm believes that the fair value estimates of
the assets acquired and liabilities assumed provide a reasonable basis for determining the estimated
bargain purchase gain. The First Republic acquisition resulted in a preliminary estimated bargain
purchase gain of $ 2.7billion. The final bargain purchase gain of $ 2.9billion reflects adjustments
of $ 103million and $ 63million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, made
during the one-year measurement period, as permitted by U.S. GAAP, to finalize management's fair
value estimates for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. As of December 31, 2024, certain
matters related to the final settlement remained outstanding between the Firm and the FDIC. On
January 17, 2025, the Firm reached an agreement with the FDIC with respect to certain outstanding
items. As a result of the agreement, the Firm made a payment of $ 609million to the FDIC on January
31, 2025 and reduced its additional payable to the FDIC, which will result in a gain of approximately
$ 600million to be recorded in other income in the first quarter of 2025. In connection with the
First Republic acquisition, the Firm and the FDIC entered into twoshared-loss agreements with respect
to certain loans and lending-related commitments (the "shared-loss assets"): the Commercial Shared-
Loss Agreement ("CSLA") and the Single-Family Shared-Loss Agreement (“SFSLA”). The CSLA covers 80% of
credit losses, on a pari passu basis, over 5years with a subsequent 3-yearrecovery period for certain
acquired commercial loans and other real estate exposure. The SFSLA covers 80% of credit losses, on a
pari passu basis, for 7years for certain acquired loans secured by mortgages on real property or
shares in cooperative property constituting a primary residence. The indemnification assets, which
represent the fair value of the CSLA and SFSLA on the acquisition date, are reflected in the total
assets acquired. As part of the consideration paid, JPMorganChase issued a five-year, $ 50billion
secured note to the FDIC (the "Purchase Money Note"). The Purchase Money Note bears interest at a
fixed rate of 3.4% and is secured by certain of the acquired loans. The Purchase Money Note is
prepayable upon notice to the holder. The Firm had placed a $ 5billion deposit with First Republic
Bank on March 16, 2023, as part of $ 30billion of deposits provided by a consortium of large U.S.
banks. The Firm's $ 5billion deposit was effectively settled as part of the acquisition and the
associated allowance for credit losses was released upon closing. The Firm subsequently repaid the
remaining $ 25billion of deposits to the consortium of banks, including accrued interest through the
payment date on May 9, 2023.

(a) Net of cash acquired of $ 680million, and including disputed amounts with the FDIC as of April
30, 2024.
(b) As part of the consideration paid, JPMorganChase issued a five-year, $ 50billion secured note to
the FDIC (the "Purchase Money Note").
(c) Includes $ 447million of securities financing transactions with First Republic Bank that were
effectively settled on the acquisition date.
(d) Other assets include $ 1.2billion in tax-oriented investments and $ 683million of lease right-of-
use assets. Other liabilities include the related tax-oriented investment liabilities of $ 669million
and lease liabilities of $ 748million.
The following describes the accounting policies and fair value methodologies generally used by the
Firm for the following assets acquired and liabilities assumed: core deposit and customer
relationship intangibles, shared-loss agreements and the related indemnification assets, Purchase
Money Note, and FHLB advances.
For further discussion of the Firm’s accounting policies and valuation methodologies, refer to Notes
2 and 3 for fair value measurement, Note 10 for investment securities, Note 12 for loans, Note 17 for
deposits, and Note 28 for lending-related commitments.
Core deposit and customer relationship intangibles Core deposit and certain wealth management
customer relationship intangibles were acquired as part of the First Republic acquisition. The core
deposit intangible of $ 1.3billion was valued by discounting estimated after-tax cost savings over
the remaining useful life of the deposits using the favorable source of funds method. The after-tax
cost savings were estimated based on the difference between the cost of maintaining the core deposit
base relative to the cost of next best alternative funding sources available to market participants.
The customer relationship intangibles of $ 180million were valued by discounting estimated after-tax
earnings over their remaining useful lives using the multi-period excess earnings method. Both
intangible asset valuations utilized assumptions that the Firm believes a market participant would
use to estimate fair values, such as growth and attrition rates, projected fee income as well as
related costs to service the relationships, and discount rates. The core deposit and customer
relationship intangibles are amortized over a projected period of future cash flows of approximately
7years. Refer to Note 15 for further discussion on other intangible assets.

Indemnification assets - Shared-loss agreements The indemnification assets represent forecasted
recoveries from the FDIC associated with the shared-loss assets over the respective shared-loss
recovery periods. The indemnification assets were recorded at fair value in other assets on the
Consolidated balance sheets on the acquisition date. The fair values of the indemnification assets
were estimated based on the timing of the forecasted losses underlying the related allowance for
credit losses. The subsequent quarterly remeasurement of the indemnification assets is based on
changes in the amount and timing of forecasted losses in the allowance for credit losses associated
with the shared-loss assets and is recorded in other income. Under certain circumstances, the Firm
may be required to make a payment to the FDIC upon termination of the shared-loss agreements based on
the level of actual losses and recoveries on the shared-loss assets. The estimated potential future
payment is reflected as contingent consideration as part of the purchase price consideration.
Purchase Money Note and FHLB advances The Purchase Money Note is recorded in long-term debt on the
Consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the Purchase Money Note was estimated based on a
discounted cash flow methodology and incorporated estimated market discount rates. The FHLB advances
assumed in the acquisition are recorded in short-term borrowings and in long-term debt. The fair
values of the FHLB advances were based on a discounted cash flow methodology and considered the
observed FHLB advance issuance rates.
Loans
The following table presents the unpaid principal balance ("UPB") and fair values of the loans
acquired as of May 1, 2023, and reflects adjustments made during the measurement period to the
acquisition-date fair value of the loans acquired .

The following table presents certain unaudited pro forma financial information for the year ended
December 31, 2023 and 2022 as if the First Republic acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2022,
including recognition of the estimated bargain purchase gain of $ 2.8billion and the provision for
credit losses of $ 1.2billion . Additional adjustments include the interest on the Purchase Money
Note and the impact of amortizing and accreting certain estimated fair value adjustments related to
intangible assets, loans and lending-related commitments.
The Firm expects to achieve operating cost savings and other business synergies resulting from the
acquisition that are not reflected in the pro forma amounts. The pro forma information is not
necessarily indicative of the historical results of operations had the acquisition occurred on
January 1, 2022, nor is it indicative of the results of operations in future periods.

Provided below is a summary of JPMorganChase’s
consolidated average balances, interest and
rates on a taxable-equivalent basis for the
years 2022 through 2024. Income computed on a
taxable-equivalent basis is the income reported
in the Consolidated statements
of income, adjusted to present interest income
and rates earned on assets exempt from income
taxes (i.e., federal taxes) on a basis
comparable with other taxable investments. The
incremental tax rate used for calculating the
taxable-equivalent adjustment was approximately
24% in 2024, 2023 and 2022 .

 Changes in net interest income, volume and rate analysis 
The table below presents an attribution of net interest income between volume and rate. The
attribution between volume and rate is calculated using annual average balances for each category of
assets and liabilities shown in the table and the corresponding annual rates (refer to pages 322-325
for more information on average balances and rates). In this analysis, when the change cannot be
isolated to either volume or rate, it has been allocated to volume. The annual rates include the
impact of changes in market rates, as well as the impact of any change in composition of the various
products within each category of asset or liability. This analysis is calculated separately for each
category without consideration of the relationship between categories (for example, the net spread
between the rates earned on assets and the rates paid on liabilities that fund those assets). As a
result, changes in the granularity or groupings considered in this analysis would produce a different
attribution result, and due to the complexities involved, precise allocation of changes in interest
rates between volume and rates is inherently complex and judgmental.

debt of the reference entity, neither party has
recourse to the reference entity. The protection
purchaser has recourse to the protection seller

instrument that contains a plain vanilla debt
instrument (i.e., the host) and an embedded
option that allows the issuer to redeem the debt
issue at a specified date for a specified amount
(i.e., the embedded derivative). However, a
floating rate instrument is not a hybrid
composed of a fixed-rate instrument and an
interest rate swap.

Origination date LTV ratio
The LTV ratio at the origination date of the
loan. Origination date LTV ratios are calculated
based on the actual appraised values of
collateral (i.e., loan-level data) at the

Mortgage origination channels:
Retail – Borrowers who buy or refinance a home

Internet or by phone. Borrowers are frequently
referred to a mortgage banker by a banker in a
Chase branch, real estate brokers, home builders
or other third parties.
Correspondent – Banks, thrifts, other mortgage
banks and other financial institutions that sell
closed loans to the Firm.
Mortgage product types:
Alt-A
Alt-A loans are generally higher in credit
quality than subprime loans but have
characteristics that would disqualify the
borrower from a traditional prime loan. Alt-A
lending characteristics may include one or more
of the following: (i) limited documentation;
(ii) a high CLTV ratio; (iii) loans secured by
non-owner occupied properties; or (iv) a debt-
to-income ratio above normal limits. A
substantial proportion of the Firm’s Alt-A loans
are those where a borrower does not provide
complete documentation of his or her assets or
the amount or source of his or her income.
Option ARMs
The option ARM real estate loan product is an
adjustable-rate mortgage loan that provides the
borrower with the option each month to make a
fully amortizing, interest-only or minimum
payment. The minimum payment on an option ARM
loan is based on the interest rate charged
during the introductory period. This
introductory rate is usually significantly below
the fully indexed rate. The fully indexed rate
is calculated using an index rate plus a margin.
Once the introductory period ends, the
contractual interest rate charged on the loan
increases to the fully indexed rate and adjusts
monthly to reflect movements in the index. The
minimum payment is typically insufficient to
cover interest accrued in the prior month, and
any unpaid interest is deferred and added to the
principal balance of the loan. Option ARM loans
are subject to payment recast, which converts
the loan to a variable-rate fully amortizing
loan upon meeting specified loan balance and
anniversary date triggers.
Prime
Prime mortgage loans are made to borrowers with
good credit records who meet specific
underwriting requirements, including
prescriptive requirements related to income and
overall debt levels. New prime mortgage
borrowers provide full documentation and
generally have reliable payment histories.
Subprime
Subprime loans are loans that, prior to
mid-2008, were offered to certain customers with
one or more high risk characteristics, including
but not limited to: (i) unreliable or poor
payment histories; (ii) a high LTV ratio of
greater than 80% (without borrower-paid mortgage
insurance); (iii) a high debt-to-income ratio;
(iv) an occupancy type for the loan is other
than the borrower’s
 330 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K

JPMorganChase grants RSUs to certain employees
under its share-based compensation programs,
which entitle the recipients to receive
nonforfeitable dividends during the vesting
period on a basis equivalent to the dividends
paid to holders of common stock. These unvested
awards meet the definition of participating
securities. Under the two-class method, all
earnings (distributed and undistributed) are
allocated to each class of common stock and
participating securities, based on their
respective rights to receive dividends.

believes that this financial measure is useful
in assessing the ability of a lending
institution to generate income in excess of its
provision for credit losses.
Pre-tax margin: Represents income before income
tax expense divided by total net revenue, which
is, in management’s view, a comprehensive
measure of pretax performance derived by
measuring earnings after all costs are taken
into consideration. It is one basis upon which
management evaluates the performance of AWM
against the performance of their respective
competitors.
Principal transactions revenue: Principal
transactions revenue is driven by many factors,
including:
• the bid-offer spread, which is the difference
between the price at which a market participant
is willing and able to sell an instrument to the
Firm and the price at which another market
participant is willing and able to buy it from
the Firm, and vice versa; and
• realized and unrealized gains and losses on
financial instruments and commodities
transactions, including those accounted for
under the fair value option, primarily used in
client-driven market-making activities.
– Realized gains and losses result from the sale
of instruments, closing out or termination of
transactions, or interim cash payments.
– Unrealized gains and losses result from
changes in valuation.
In connection with its client-driven market-
making activities, the Firm transacts in debt
and equity instruments, derivatives and
commodities, including physical commodities
inventories and financial instruments that
reference commodities.
Principal transactions revenue also includes
realized and unrealized gains and losses related
to:
• derivatives designated in qualifying hedge
accounting relationships, primarily fair value
hedges of commodity and foreign exchange risk;
• derivatives used for specific risk management
purposes, primarily to mitigate credit, foreign
exchange and interest rate risks.
Production revenue: Includes fees and income
recognized as earned on mortgage loans

Advanced approach) which include capital
requirements for credit risk, market risk, and
in the case of Basel III Advanced, also
operational risk. Key differences in the
calculation of credit risk RWA between the
Standardized and Advanced approaches are that
for Basel III Advanced, credit risk RWA is based
on risk-sensitive approaches which largely rely
on the use of internal credit models and
parameters, whereas for Basel III Standardized,
credit risk RWA is generally based on
supervisory risk-weightings which vary primarily
by counterparty type and asset class. Market
risk RWA is calculated on a generally consistent
basis between Basel III Standardized and Basel
III Advanced.
