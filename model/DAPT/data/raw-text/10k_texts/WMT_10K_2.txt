 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
 General 
Walmart Inc. ("Walmart," the "Company" or "we") is a people-led, technology-powered omni-channel
retailer dedicated to helping people around the world save money and live better – anytime and
anywhere – by providing the opportunity to shop in both retail stores and through eCommerce, and to
access our other service offerings. Through innovation, we strive to continuously improve a customer-
centric experience that seamlessly integrates our eCommerce and retail stores in an omni-channel
offering that saves time for our customers. Each week, we serve approximately 255 million customers
who visit more than 10,500 stores and numerous eCommerce websites in 19 countries.
Our strategy is to make every day easier for busy families, operate with discipline, sharpen our
culture and become more digital, and make trust a competitive advantage. Making life easier for busy
families includes our commitment to price leadership, which has been and will remain a cornerstone of
our business, as well as increasing convenience to save our customers time. By leading on price, we
earn the trust of our customers every day by providing a broad assortment of quality merchandise and
services at everyday low prices ("EDLP"). EDLP is our pricing philosophy under which we price items
at a low price every day so our customers trust that our prices will not change under frequent
promotional activity. Everyday low cost ("EDLC") is our commitment to control expenses so our cost
savings can be passed along to our customers.
Our operations comprise three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's
Club. Our fiscal year ends on January 31 for our United States ("U.S.") and Canadian operations. We
consolidate all other operations generally using a one-month lag and on a calendar year basis. Our
discussion is as of, and for the fiscal years ended, January 31, 2024 ("fiscal 2024"), January 31,
2023 ("fiscal 2023") and January 31, 2022 ("fiscal 2022"). During fiscal 2024, we generated total
revenues of $648.1 billion, which was comprised primarily of net sales of $642.6 billion.
We maintain our principal offices in Bentonville, Arkansas. Our common stock trades on the New York
Stock Exchange under the symbol "WMT."
 The Development of Our Company 
The businesses conducted by our founders began in 1945 when Sam M. Walton opened a franchise Ben
Franklin variety store in Newport, Arkansas. In 1946, his brother, James L. Walton, opened a similar
store in Versailles, Missouri. Until 1962, our founders' business was devoted entirely to the
operation of variety stores, at which time we began to open discount stores. We completed our initial
public offering in 1970. In 1983, we opened our first Sam's Club, and in 1988, we opened our first
supercenter. In 1998, we opened our first Walmart Neighborhood Market. In 1991, we began our first
international initiative when we entered into a joint venture in Mexico and, as of January 31, 2024,
our Walmart International segment conducted business in 18 countries.
In 2000, we began our first eCommerce initiative by creating both walmart.com and samsclub.com. Since
then, our eCommerce presence has continued to grow. In 2007, leveraging our physical stores,
walmart.com launched its Site-to-Store service, enabling customers to make a purchase online and pick
up merchandise in stores. To date, we now have over 8,000 pickup and over 7,800 delivery locations
globally. In recent years, we expanded our eCommerce and digital presence through acquisitions with
our majority stakes in Flipkart and PhonePe in India. We continue to heavily invest in omni-channel
and eCommerce innovation, which enables us to leverage technology, talent and expertise, and expand
our assortment and service offerings.
We are enhancing our omni-channel capabilities through a combination of stores, eCommerce websites
and service offerings, as well as our supply chain, combined with approximately 2.1 million
associates as of January 31, 2024, to better serve our customers. Together, these elements produce a
global retail ecosystem that we believe allows customers to view Walmart as their primary retail
destination. In the U.S., our Walmart+ membership incorporates several service offerings which
provide enhanced omni-channel shopping experiences and benefits for members. As we execute on our
strategy globally, our business is expanding through offerings such as advertising, marketplace and
fulfillment services, healthcare and financial services. These offerings represent mutually
reinforcing pieces of our omni-channel model centered on our customers around the world who are
increasingly seeking convenience.

 Information About Our Segments 
We are engaged in global operations of retail, wholesale and other units, as well as eCommerce,
located throughout the U.S., Africa, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India and Mexico. We also
previously operated in the United Kingdom and Japan prior to the sale of those operations in the
first quarter of fiscal 2022. Refer to Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for
information on these divestitures. Our operations are conducted in three reportable segments: Walmart
U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club, which are further described below. Each segment
contributes to the Company's operating results differently. However, each has generally maintained a
consistent contribution rate to the Company's net sales in recent years other than minor changes to
the contribution rate for the Walmart International segment due to the exit of certain markets and
fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Additional information on our operating segments and
geographic information is contained in Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
 Walmart U.S. Segment 
Walmart U.S. is our largest segment and operates in the U.S., including in all 50 states, Washington
D.C. and Puerto Rico. Walmart U.S. is a mass merchandiser of consumer products, operating under the
"Walmart" and "Walmart Neighborhood Market" brands, including walmart.com. Walmart U.S. had net sales
of $441.8 billion for fiscal 2024, representing 69% of our fiscal 2024 consolidated net sales, and
had net sales of $420.6 billion and $393.2 billion for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. Of our
three segments, Walmart U.S. has historically had the highest gross profit as a percentage of net
sales ("gross profit rate"). In addition, Walmart U.S. has historically contributed the greatest
amount to the Company's net sales and operating income.
Omni-channel. Walmart U.S. provides an omni-channel experience to customers, integrating retail
stores and eCommerce, through services such as pickup and delivery, in-home delivery, ship-from-store
and digital pharmacy fulfillment options. As of January 31, 2024, the vast majority of our stores
have pickup locations and more than 4,300 locations offer same-day delivery. Our Walmart+ membership
offering provides enhanced omni-channel shopping benefits including unlimited free shipping on
eligible items with no order minimum, unlimited delivery from store, fuel discounts, mobile Scan & Go
and access to additional member benefits. We define eCommerce sales as sales initiated by customers
digitally and fulfilled by a number of methods including our dedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers
and leveraging our stores, as well as certain other business offerings that are part of our
ecosystem, such as our Walmart Connect advertising business. The following table provides the
approximate size of our retail stores as of January 31, 2024:

Merchandise. Walmart U.S. does business primarily in three strategic merchandise units, listed below:
• Grocery consists of a full line of grocery items, including dry grocery, snacks, dairy, meat,
produce, deli & bakery, frozen foods, alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages, as well as consumables
such as health and beauty aids, pet supplies, household chemicals, paper goods and baby products;
• General merchandise includes:
◦ Entertainment (e.g., electronics, toys, seasonal merchandise, wireless, video games, movies, music
and books);
◦ Hardlines (e.g., automotive, hardware and paint, sporting goods, outdoor living and stationery);
◦ Fashion (e.g., apparel for adults and children, as well as shoes, jewelry and accessories); and
◦ Home (e.g., housewares and small appliances, bed & bath, furniture and home organization, home
furnishings, home decor, fabrics and crafts).
• Health and wellness includes pharmacy, over-the-counter drugs and other medical products, optical
services and other clinical services.
Other categories in the Walmart U.S. business include fuel and various service offerings such as in-
house advertising via Walmart Connect, supply chain and fulfillment capabilities to online
marketplace sellers via Walmart Fulfillment Services, initiatives such as business-to-business last
mile delivery services via Walmart GoLocal, and a suite of data products for merchants and suppliers
via Walmart Luminate. Additional service offerings include financial services and related products
(including through our digital channels, stores and our fintech venture, ONE), such as money orders,
prepaid access, money transfers, check cashing, bill payment and certain types of installment
lending.
Brand name merchandise represents a significant portion of the merchandise sold in Walmart U.S. We
also market lines of merchandise under our private brands, including brands such as: "Allswell,"
"Athletic Works," "Equate," "Free Assembly,"
 7 
"Freshness Guaranteed," "George," "Great Value," "Holiday Time," "Hyper Tough," "Mainstays,"
"Marketside," "No Boundaries," "onn.," "Ozark Trail," "Parent's Choice," "Sam's Choice," "Scoop,"
"Spring Valley," "Time and Tru," "Way to Celebrate" and "Wonder Nation." The Company also markets
lines of merchandise under licensed brands, some of which include: "Avia," "Better Homes & Gardens,"
"Love & Sports," "Sofia Jeans by Sofia Vergara," and "The Pioneer Woman."
Periodically, revisions are made to the categorization of the components comprising our strategic
merchandise units. When revisions are made, the previous periods' presentation is adjusted to
maintain comparability.
Operations. Walmart U.S. is available to customers through supercenters, discount stores and
neighborhood markets, as well as online or through the mobile application 24 hours a day. Consistent
with its strategy, Walmart U.S. continues to develop technology tools and services to better serve
customers and help stores operate more efficiently, such as pickup and delivery, Walmart+, ship-from-
store and other initiatives which provide convenient and seamless omni-channel shopping experiences.
Seasonal Aspects of Operations. Walmart U.S.'s business is seasonal to a certain extent due to
calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as different weather patterns.
Historically, its highest sales volume has occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31.
Competition. Walmart U.S. competes with brick and mortar, eCommerce and omni-channel retailers
operating discount, department, retail and wholesale grocers, drug, dollar, variety and specialty
stores, supermarkets, hypermarkets and supercenter-type stores, social commerce platforms, as well as
companies that offer services in digital advertising, fulfillment and delivery services, health and
wellness and financial services. Each of these landscapes is highly competitive and rapidly evolving,
and new business models and the entry of new, well-funded competitors continue to intensify this
competition. Some of our competitors have longer histories in these lines of business, more customers
and greater brand recognition. They may be able to obtain more favorable terms from suppliers and
business partners and to devote greater resources to the development of these businesses. In
addition, for eCommerce and other internet-based businesses, newer or smaller businesses may be
better able to innovate and compete with us.
Our ability to develop and operate units at the right locations and to deliver a customer-centric
omni-channel experience largely determines our competitive position within the retail industry. We
compete in a variety of ways, including the prices at which we sell our merchandise, merchandise and
selection availability, services offered to customers, the quality of the products and services we
offer, location, store hours, in-store amenities, the shopping convenience and overall shopping
experience we offer, the attractiveness and ease of use of our digital platforms, cost and speed of
and options for delivery to customers of merchandise purchased through our digital platforms or
through our omni-channel integration of our physical and digital operations. We employ many
strategies and programs designed to meet competitive pressures within our industry. These strategies
include the following:
• EDLP: our pricing philosophy under which we price items at everyday low prices so our customers
trust that our prices will not change under frequent promotional activity;
• EDLC: everyday low cost is our commitment to control expenses so our cost savings can be passed
along to our customers;
• Omni-channel offerings such as pickup and delivery and our Walmart+ membership offering, all of
which enhance convenience and seek to serve customers in the ways they want to be served; and
• Expanding our ecosystem and the products and services we offer in areas such as digital
advertising, fulfillment services, health and wellness, and financial services to provide our
customers a broader set of offerings to meet expanding needs.
Distribution. We continue to invest in supply chain automation and utilize a total of 162
distribution facilities which are located strategically throughout the U.S. For fiscal 2024, the
majority of Walmart U.S.'s purchases of store merchandise were shipped through these facilities,
while most of the remaining store merchandise we purchased was shipped directly from suppliers.
General merchandise and dry grocery merchandise is transported primarily through the segment's
private truck fleet; however, we contract with common carriers to transport the majority of our
perishable grocery merchandise. We ship merchandise purchased by customers on our eCommerce platforms
by a number of methods from multiple locations including from our 30 dedicated eCommerce fulfillment
centers, as well as leveraging our ability to ship or deliver directly from more tha n 4,300 s tores,
some of which include market fulfillment centers, which are positioned inside or attached to our
stores to fill online orders more efficiently.
 8 
 Walmart International Segment 
Walmart International is our second largest segment and operates in 18 countries outside of the U.S.
Walmart International operates through our wholly-owned subsidiaries in Canada, Chile, China, and
Africa (which includes Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Eswatini, and
Zambia), and our majority-owned subsidiaries in India, as well as Mexico and Central America (which
includes Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua). Walmart International
previously operated in the United Kingdom and Japan prior to the sale of those operations in the
first quarter of fiscal 2022. Refer to Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for
discussion of recent divestitures.
Walmart International includes numerous formats divided into two major categories: retail and
wholesale. These categories consist of many formats, including: supercenters, supermarkets,
hypermarkets, warehouse clubs (including Sam's Clubs) and cash & carry, as well as eCommerce through
websites and mobile applications, including walmart.com.mx, walmart.ca, flipkart.com, PhonePe and
other sites. Walmart International had net sales of $114.6 billion for fiscal 2024, representing 18%
of our fiscal 2024 consolidated net sales, and had net sales of $101.0 billion for both fiscal 2023
and 2022. The gross profit rate is slightly lower than that of Walmart U.S. primarily because of its
format and channel mix.
Walmart International's strategy is to create strong local businesses powered by Walmart, which means
being locally relevant and customer-focused in each of the markets it operates. We are being
deliberate about where and how we choose to operate and continue to re-shape the portfolio to best
enable long-term, sustainable and profitable growth. As such, we have taken certain strategic actions
to strengthen our Walmart International portfolio for the long-term, which include the following
highlights over the last three years:
• Divested of Asda Group Limited ("Asda"), our retail operations in the U.K., in February 2021.
• Divested of a majority stake in Seiyu, our retail operations in Japan, in March 2021.
• Bought out the noncontrolling interest shareholders of our Massmart subsidiary in November 2022 and
exited operations in certain countries in Africa.
• Increased our ownership in PhonePe, our digital payments platform in India, as part of the
separation from Flipkart in December 2022.
Omni-channel. Walmart International provides an omni-channel experience to customers, integrating
retail stores and eCommerce, such as through pickup and delivery services in most of our markets and
our marketplaces such as Flipkart in India. Our financial services offerings continue to grow with
our digital payment platform at PhonePe in India. We continue to expand our marketplace offerings,
which also unlock fulfillment and advertising services.
Generally, retail units' selling areas range in size from 1,400 square feet to 186,000 square feet.
Our wholesale stores' selling areas generally range in size from 25,000 square feet to 158,000 square
feet. As of January 31, 2024, Walmart International had over 2,800 pickup and over 2,900 delivery
locations.
Merchandise. The merchandising strategy for Walmart International is similar to that of our
operations in the U.S. in terms of the breadth and scope of merchandise offered for sale. While brand
name merchandise accounts for a majority of our sales, we have both leveraged U.S. private brands and
developed market specific private brands to serve our customers with high quality, low priced items.
Along with the private brands we market globally, such as "Equate," "George," "Great Value," "Holiday
Time," "Mainstays," "Marketside" and "Parent's Choice," our international markets have developed
market specific brands including "Aurrera" and "Lider." In addition, we have developed and continue
to grow our relationships with regional and local suppliers in each market to ensure reliable sources
of quality merchandise that is equal to national brands at low prices.
Consistent with its strategy, Walmart International continues to build mutually reinforcing
businesses in areas such as advertising, marketplace and fulfillment services, healthcare and
financial services. Our businesses in Mexico and Canada, for example, offer prepaid cards and money
transfers, and our PhonePe business in India continues to grow, providing a platform that offers
mobile and bill payment, person-to-person (P2P) payment, investment and insurance solutions,
financial services and advertising. In Mexico, we also offer a value-based internet and telephone
service allowing customers to enjoy digital connectivity. Combined, these offerings did not represent
a significant portion of annual segment revenues.
Operations. The hours of operation for operating units in Walmart International vary by country and
by individual markets within countries, depending upon local and national ordinances governing hours
of operation. Customers can also access online and mobile applications 24 hours a day. Consistent
with its strategy, Walmart International continues to develop technology tools and services to better
serve customers and help its various formats operate more efficiently, as well as to provide
convenient and seamless omni-channel shopping experiences.
Seasonal Aspects of Operations. Walmart International's business is seasonal to a certain extent.
Historically, its highest sales volume has occurred in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. The
seasonality of the business varies by country due to different national and religious holidays,
festivals and customs, as well as different weather patterns.
 9 
Competition. Walmart International competes with brick and mortar, eCommerce and omni-channel
retailers who operate department, drug, discount, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets,
hypermarkets and supercenter-type stores, wholesale clubs, home-improvement stores, specialty
electronics stores, cash & carry operations and convenience stores, and direct to consumer offerings,
as well as companies that offer services in digital advertising, fulfillment services, health and
wellness and financial services. Our ability to develop and operate units at the right locations and
to deliver a customer-centric omni-channel experience largely determines our competitive position
within the retail industry. We believe price leadership is a critical part of our business model and
we continue to progress our markets towards an EDLP approach. Additionally, our ability to operate
food departments effectively has a significant impact on our competitive position in many of the
markets where we operate. Each of these landscapes is highly competitive and rapidly evolving, and
new business models and the entry of new or well-funded competitors continue to intensify this
competition. Some of our competitors have longer histories in these lines of business, more customers
and greater brand recognition and therefore they may be able to obtain more favorable terms from
suppliers and business partners and to devote greater resources to the development of these
businesses. In addition, for eCommerce and other internet-based businesses, newer or smaller
businesses may be better able to innovate and compete with us.
Distribution. We utilize a total of 176 distribution facilities located in Canada, Central America,
Chile, China, India, Mexico and Africa. Through these facilities, we process and distribute both
imported and domestic products to the operating units of the Walmart International segment. During
fiscal 2024, the majority of Walmart International's purchases passed through these distribution
facilities. Suppliers ship the remainder of Walmart International's purchases directly to our stores
in the various markets in which we operate. Across the segment, we have efficient networks connecting
physical stores and distribution and fulfillment centers, which facilitate the movement of goods to
where our customers live. We ship merchandise purchased by customers on our eCommerce platforms by a
number of methods from multiple locations, such as in India where we utilize a combination of more
than 3,500 eCommerce fulfillment centers, sort centers and last-mile delivery facilities, as well as
our physical retail stores.
 Sam's Club Segment 
Sam's Club operates in 44 states in the U.S. and in Puerto Rico. Sam's Club is a membership-only
warehouse club that also operates samsclub.com. Sam's Club had net sales of $86.2 billion for fiscal
2024, representing 13% of our consolidated fiscal 2024 net sales, and had net sales of $84.3 billion
and $73.6 billion for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. As a membership-only warehouse club,
membership income is a significant component of the segment's operating income. Sam's Club operates
with a lower gross profit rate and lower operating expenses as a percentage of net sales than our
other segments.
Membership. The following two options are available to members:
 Plus Membership Club Membership 
 Annual Membership Fee $110 $50

those not found in our clubs, online at samsclub.com and through our mobile commerce applications.
The warehouse facility sizes generally range between 32,000 and 168,000 square feet, with an average
size of approximately 134,000 square feet.
Merchandise. Sam's Club offers merchandise in the following five merchandise categories:
• Grocery and consumables includes dairy, meat, bakery, deli, produce, dry, chilled or frozen

Operations. Sam's Club is available to members through warehouse club locations, as well as online or
through the mobile application 24 hours a day. Club locations offer Plus Members the ability to shop
before regular operating hours. Consistent with its strategy, Sam's Club continues to develop
technology tools to drive a great member experience. Curbside Pickup is available at clubs to help
provide fast, easy and contact-free shopping for members. Sam's Club also offers Scan & Go, a mobile
checkout and payment solution, which allows members to bypass the checkout line.
Seasonal Aspects of Operations. Sam's Club's business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar
events and national and religious holidays, as well as different weather patterns. Historically, its
highest sales volume has occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31.
Competition. Sam's Club competes with other membership-only warehouse clubs, the largest of which is
Costco, as well as with discount retailers, retail and wholesale grocers, general merchandise
wholesalers and distributors, gasoline stations as well as omni-channel and eCommerce retailers and
catalog businesses. At Sam's Club, we provide value at members-only prices, a quality merchandise
assortment, and bulk sizing to serve both our Plus and Club members. Our eCommerce website and mobile
commerce applications have increasingly become important factors in our ability to compete.
Distribution. We utilize 30 dedicated distribution facilities located strategically throughout the
U.S., as well as some of the Walmart U.S. segment's distribution facilities which service the Sam's
Club segment for certain items. During fiscal 2024, the majority of Sam's Club's non-fuel club
purchases were shipped from these facilities, while the remainder of our purchases were shipped
directly to Sam's Club locations by suppliers. Sam's Club ships merchandise purchased on samsclub.com
and through its mobile commerce applications by a number of methods including shipments made directly
from clubs, 15 dedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers and other distribution centers.
Sam's Club uses a combination of our private truck fleet, as well as common carriers, to transport
perishable and non-perishable merchandise from distribution facilities to clubs.
 Intellectual Property 
We regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade
secrets, proprietary technologies and similar intellectual property as important to our success, and
with respect to our associates, customers and others, we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent
laws, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements to protect our
proprietary rights. We have registered, or applied for the registration of, a number of U.S. and
international domain names, trademarks, service marks and copyrights. Additionally, we have filed
U.S. and international patent applications covering certain of our proprietary technology. We have
licensed in the past, and expect that we may license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights
to third parties.
 Suppliers and Supply Chain 
As a retailer and warehouse club operator, we utilize a global supply chain that includes both U.S.
and international suppliers from whom we purchase the merchandise that we sell in our stores, clubs
and online. In many instances, we purchase merchandise from producers located near the stores and
clubs in which such merchandise will be sold, particularly products in the "fresh" category.
Consistent with applicable laws, we offer our suppliers the opportunity to efficiently sell
significant quantities of their products to us. These relationships enable us to obtain pricing that
reflects the volume, certainty and cost-effectiveness these arrangements provide to such suppliers,
which in turn enables us to provide low prices to our customers. Our suppliers are subject to
standards of conduct, including requirements that they comply with local labor laws, local worker
safety laws and other applicable laws. Our ability to acquire from our suppliers the assortment and
volume of products we wish to offer to our customers, to receive those products within the required
time through our supply chain and to distribute those products to our stores and clubs, determines,
along with other supply chain logistics matters (such as containers or port access for example), in
part, our in-stock levels in our stores and clubs and the attractiveness of our merchandise
assortment we offer to our customers and members.
 Government Regulation 
As a company with global operations, we are subject to the laws of the United States and multiple
foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies,
which may differ among jurisdictions. For additional information, see the risk factors herein in "
Item 1A. Risk Factors " under the sub-caption "Legal, Tax, Regulatory, Compliance, Reputational and
Other Risks."
 11 
Environmental, Social and Governance ("ESG") Priorities
Our ESG strategy is centered on the concept of creating shared value: we believe we maximize long-
term value and create competitive advantage for the Company by serving our stakeholders, including
our customers, associates, shareholders, suppliers, business partners and communities. We believe
that addressing such societal needs builds the value of our business, including by enhancing customer
and associate trust, creating new business opportunities, managing cost and risk, building
capabilities for future advantage and strengthening the underlying systems on which Walmart and our
stakeholders rely.
We prioritize the ESG issues that offer the greatest potential for Walmart to create shared value:
issues that rank high in relevance to our business and stakeholders and which Walmart is positioned
to make a positive impact. Our current ESG priorities are categorized into four broad themes:
opportunity, sustainability, community and ethics and integrity.
• Opportunity . Retail can be a powerful engine for inclusive economic opportunity. We aim to advance
belonging, diversity, equity and inclusion, and create opportunity for Walmart associates (as further
described in the Human Capital Management section below), our suppliers and workers in supply chains,
and the communities in which we operate. Doing so helps us fulfill our customer mission, strengthens
our business and helps people build a better life for themselves and their families.
• Sustainability . Walmart's sustainability efforts focus on our ability to create and preserve long-
term value for both people and planet. With respect to people, our sustainability efforts include
sourcing responsibly, helping prevent forced labor, empowering women, creating inclusive economic
opportunity and selling safer, healthier products. With respect to the planet, our efforts aim to
enhance the sustainability of product supply chains by reducing emissions, protecting and restoring
nature and reducing waste. To help address the effects of climate change, Walmart has set science-
based targets for emissions reduction, including our goal to achieve zero emissions in our operations
by 2040—without offsets—and to reduce, avoid or sequester one billion metric tons of emissions in our
value chain by 2030 under our Project Gigaton initiative.
• Community . Walmart aims to serve and strengthen communities by operating our business in a way
that meets the needs of our customer and community stakeholder groups, including by providing safer,
healthier and more affordable food and other products, disaster support, associate volunteerism,
local grant programs and community cohesion initiatives.
• Ethics and Integrity . At every level of our Company, we work to create a culture that inspires
trust among our associates, with our customers and in the communities we serve .
We periodically publish information on our ESG priorities, strategies and progress on our corporate
website and may update those disclosures from time to time. Nothing on our website, including our ESG
reporting, documents or sections thereof, shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this Annual
Report on Form 10-K or incorporated by reference into any of our other filings with the SEC.
 Human Capital Management 
Our associates – powered by technology – play a critical role in delivering on our purpose to help
people save money and live better. Our business is focused on serving people and this is delivered by
our approximately 2.1 million associates around the world with approximately 1.6 million associates
in the U.S. and approximately 0.5 million associates internationally. In the U.S., approximately 92%
of our associates are hourly and approximately 69% of our associates are full-time.
We believe our people make the difference, and we are focused on investing in the growth and well-
being of our associates, investing in digital experiences to improve their quality of work and
creating a culture of belonging. An important part of our focus is to provide opportunities for
associates to grow and learn. For some, we are a foundational entry point to develop critical skills
that are relevant for a variety of careers. We are focused on developing, rewarding and retaining
associates in an ever-changing environment. Our people ultimately make Walmart a better place to work
and a better place to shop. Our workforce strategy includes the following strategic priorities:
belonging, well-being, growth and digital.
Belonging - Focus on creating a workplace where all associates feel seen, supported and connected
through a culture of belonging. We publish our diversity representation twice yearly and hold
ourselves accountable to providing recurring belonging, diversity, equity and inclusion updates to
senior leadership – including our President and CEO – and members of the Board of Directors. Of the
approximately 2.1 million associates employed worldwide, 52% identify as women. In the U.S., 51% of
the approximately 1.6 million associates identify as people of color.
Our Belonging programs aim to create equitable opportunities for everyone, regardless of background,
so that every eligible and qualified individual can thrive and perform. We regularly review our
processes around fair-pay practices and are committed to creating a performance culture where
associates are rewarded based on meaningful factors such as qualifications, experience, performance
and the work they do.
 12 
To build a company where associates feel seen, supported and connected, we gather and respond to
associate feedback in a variety of ways, including in-person dialogue; real-time digital insights
such as pulse surveys; formal surveys like our associate engagement survey; and always-on
confidential channels, including our Open Door process and ethics channels.
Well-being - Prioritize the emotional, physical and financial well-being of associates. We invest in
our associates by offering competitive wages, as well as a broad range of benefits to meet the
diverse needs of our global associate population and their eligible dependents. In the U.S., this
includes company-paid benefits such as 401(k) match, family building support, maternity leave,
fertility benefits, a paid parental leave program to all full-time associates, paid time off,
Associate Stock Purchase Plan match, life insurance, behavioral and mental health services, a Walmart
discount card or Sam's Club membership and predictable scheduling that helps associates plan for life
outside of work and know what to expect in their paychecks.
Additional information about how we invest in our associates' well-being, including wage structure
and pay, can be found in our Human Capital brief in our most recent ESG reporting, which is available
on our corporate website. Nothing on our website, including our ESG reporting documents, or sections
thereof, shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K or
incorporated by reference into any of our other filings with the SEC. Certain information relating to
retirement-related benefits we provide to our associates is included in Note 11 to our Consolidated
Financial Statements.
Growth - Provide ongoing growth, development and learning opportunities for associates and continue
to attract talent with new skills. We are invested in the growth of our associates – in support of
our business and their success – by offering good jobs that lead to great careers and better lives.
Approximately 75% of our U.S. salaried store, club and supply chain management started their careers
in hourly positions. Our focus on providing a path of opportunity for our associates through robust
training, competitive wages and benefits and career advancement creates a strong associate value
proposition and strengthens our workforce. In the U.S., we seek to enable these pathways through
programs like Walmart Academy and Live Better U (LBU). Walmart Academy offers training for on-the-job
retail skills, leadership and well-being, serving our associates through a combination of digital and
in-person offerings. Additionally, our LBU program provides access to educational opportunities for
our part-time and full-time frontline eligible associates in the U.S. through high school diplomas,
short-form certificates and credentials or college degrees.
Digital - Drive a digital transformation that improves the associate experience and powers the
business . To deliver a seamless customer and associate experience, we continue to invest in
consumer-grade digital tools designed to improve associate productivity and efficiency, engagement
and performance, allowing associates to spend more time generating new ideas, developing strategy and
building relationships. This capability has been expanded to certain international markets.
Technology is also used to improve associate experience, including an app developed to capture real-
time associate feedback. Walmart also supports associates on the U.S. Medical Plan with free virtual
visits for medical doctor urgent care and mental health care with psychiatrists and psychologists.

 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
The risks described below could, in ways we may or may not be able to accurately predict, materially
and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial position and liquidity. Our
business operations could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies
operating in the U.S. and globally. The following risk factors do not identify all risks that we may
face.
 Strategic Risks 
Failure to successfully execute our omni-channel strategy and the cost of our investments in
eCommerce and technology may materially adversely affect our market position, net sales and financial
performance.
The retail business continues to rapidly evolve and consumers increasingly embrace digital shopping.
As a result, the portion of total consumer expenditures with retailers and wholesale clubs occurring
through digital platforms is increasing and the pace of this increase could continue to accelerate.
Our strategy, which includes investments in eCommerce, technology, including the use of artificial
intelligence technology, talent, supply chain automation, acquisitions, joint ventures, store
remodels and other customer initiatives may not adequately or effectively allow us to continue to
grow our eCommerce business, increase comparable sales, maintain or grow our overall market position
or otherwise offset the impact on the growth of our business of a moderated pace of new store and
club openings and sustain the current pace of remodels. The success of this strategy will depend in
large measure on our ability to continue building and delivering a seamless omni-channel shopping
experience and interconnected ecosystem for our customers that deepens and maintains our
relationships with our customers across our various businesses and partnerships and reinforces our
overall enterprise strategy. The success of this strategy is further subject to the related risks
discussed in this Item 1A . With the interconnected components of this enterprise strategy and an
increasing allocation of capital expenditures focused on these initiatives, changes in customer or
member perceptions about our reputation or our failure to successfully execute on individual
components of this strategy may adversely affect our market position, net sales and financial
performance, which could also result in impairment charges to intangible assets or other long-lived
assets. In addition, a greater concentration of eCommerce sales, including increasing online grocery
sales, could result in a reduction in the amount of traffic in our stores and clubs, which would, in
turn, reduce the opportunities for cross-store or cross-club sales of merchandise that such traffic
creates and could reduce our sales within our stores and clubs and materially adversely affect our
financial performance.
Furthermore, the cost of certain investments in eCommerce, technology, talent and automation,
including any operating losses incurred for those initiatives, will adversely impact our financial
performance in the short-term and failure to realize the benefits of these investments may adversely
impact our financial performance over the longer term.
If we do not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends or preferences, it could
negatively affect our relationship with our customers, demand for the products and services we sell,
our market share and the growth of our business.
It is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will
demand and changes in their shopping patterns, tastes and preferences. The success of our business
depends in part on how accurately we predict consumer demand, availability of merchandise, the
related impact on the demand for existing products and services and the competitive environment. Our
business is dependent on our ability to make critical decisions and predictions with respect to
merchandise categories that quickly respond to changing consumer spending patterns, tastes and
preferences, any incorrect calculations by us may result in lower sales, spoilage and inventory
markdowns, which could adversely impact our results of operations. Our ability to predict and adapt
to changing tastes and preferences depends on many factors, including obtaining accurate and
 15 
relevant data on customer preferences, emphasizing relevant merchandise categories, effectively
managing our inventory levels, and implementing competitive and effective pricing and promotion
strategies. Price transparency, assortment of products, customer experience, convenience, ease and
the speed and cost of shipping are of primary importance to customers and continue to increase in
importance, particularly as a result of digital tools and social media available to consumers and the
choices available to consumers for purchasing products. We must continue to preserve our reputation,
which is impacted based on public perceptions. It may be difficult to address negative publicity
across media channels, regardless of whether it is accurate. Negative incidents involving us, our
workforce (including the loss of merchandise as a result of shrink or theft) or others with whom we
do business could quickly erode trust and confidence in our business and could result in consumer
boycotts, workforce unrest and government investigations. Negative reputational incidents or negative
perceptions of us could adversely impact our business and results of operations, including through
lower sales, the termination of business relationships and associate retention and recruiting
efforts. Moreover, failure to adequately predict customer demand and consumer spending patterns or
otherwise optimize and operate our distribution and fulfillment centers could result in excess or
insufficient inventory, service interruptions and increased costs, any of which could significantly
harm our business. As we continue to add new fulfillment centers, our fulfillment and technology
networks become increasingly complex and operating them becomes more challenging. There can be no
assurance that we will be able to operate our networks effectively.
We face strong competition from other retailers, wholesale club operators, omni-channel retailers and
other businesses which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.
Each of our segments competes for customers, employees, digital prominence, products and services and
in other important aspects of its business with many other local, regional, national and global
physical, eCommerce and omni-channel retailers, social commerce platforms, wholesale club operators
and retail intermediaries, as well as companies that offer services in digital advertising,
fulfillment and delivery services, health and wellness and financial services. The omni-channel
retail landscape is highly competitive and rapidly evolving, and the entry of new, well-funded
competitors may increase competitive pressures. In addition, for eCommerce and other internet-based
businesses, newer or smaller businesses may be better able to innovate and compete with us.
We compete in a variety of ways, including the prices at which we sell our merchandise, merchandise
selection and availability, services offered to customers, location, store hours, in-store amenities,
the shopping convenience and overall shopping experience we offer, the attractiveness and ease of use
of our digital platforms, cost and speed of and options for delivery to customers of merchandise
purchased through our digital platforms or through our omni-channel integration of our physical and
digital operations.
A failure to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail and other markets
in which we operate, omni-channel innovations and omni-channel ecosystems developed by our
competitors or delays or failure in execution of our strategy could materially adversely affect our
financial performance. See " Item 1. Business " above for additional discussion of the competitive
situation of each of our reportable segments.
Certain segments of the retail industry are undergoing consolidation or substantially reducing
operations, whether due to bankruptcy, consolidation or other factors. Such consolidation, or other
business combinations or alliances, competitive omni-channel ecosystems or reductions in operations
may result in competitors with greatly improved financial resources, improved access to merchandise,
greater market penetration and other improvements in their competitive positions. Such business
combinations or alliances could allow these companies to provide a wider variety of products and
services at competitive prices, which could adversely affect our financial performance.
General or macro-economic factors, both domestically and internationally, may materially adversely
affect our financial performance.
General economic conditions and other economic factors, globally or in one or more of the markets we
serve, may adversely affect our financial performance. Higher interest rates, higher prices of
petroleum products, including crude oil, natural gas, gasoline and diesel fuel, higher costs for
electricity and other energy, weakness in the housing market, inflation, deflation, increased costs
of essential services, such as medical care and utilities, higher levels of unemployment, decreases
in consumer disposable income, unavailability of consumer credit, higher consumer debt levels,
changes in consumer spending and shopping patterns, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, higher
tax rates, imposition of new taxes or other changes in tax laws, changes in healthcare laws, other
regulatory changes, the imposition of tariffs or other measures that create barriers to or increase
the costs associated with international trade, overall economic slowdown or recession and other
economic factors in the U.S., or in any of the other markets in which we operate, could adversely
affect consumer demand for the products and services we sell in the U.S. or such other markets,
change the mix of products we sell to one with a lower average gross margin, cause a slowdown in
discretionary purchases of goods, adversely affect our net sales, growth rates, operating income and
result in slower inventory turnover and greater markdowns of inventory, or otherwise materially
adversely affect our operations and operating results and could result in impairment charges to
intangible assets, goodwill or other long-lived assets.
In addition, the economic factors listed above, any other economic factors or circumstances resulting
in higher transportation, labor, insurance or healthcare costs or commodity prices, including energy
prices, and other economic factors in the U.S. and
 16 
other countries in which we operate can increase our cost of sales and operating, selling, general
and administrative expenses and otherwise materially adversely affect our operations and operating
results.
The economic factors that affect our operations may also adversely affect the operations of our
suppliers, which can result in an increase in the cost to us of the goods we sell to our customers
or, in more extreme cases, in certain suppliers not producing goods in the volume typically available
to us for sale, or adversely impact product margins due to higher labor and material costs of our
suppliers that we are unable, or choose not, to pass on to our customers.
The performance of strategic alliances and other business relationships to support the expansion of
our business could materially adversely affect our financial performance.
We may enter into strategic alliances and other business relationships in the countries in which we
have existing operations or in other markets to expand our business. These arrangements (such as ONE,
our fintech venture, and our healthcare initiative with UnitedHealth Group) may not generate the
level of sales or profitability we anticipate when entering into the arrangement or may otherwise
adversely impact our business and competitive position relative to the results we could have achieved
in the absence of such alliance. In addition, any investment we make in connection with a strategic
alliance, business relationship or in certain of our divested markets, could materially adversely
affect our financial performance.
 Operational Risks 
Global or regional health pandemics or epidemics, such as COVID-19, could negatively impact our
business, financial position and results of operations.
The emergence, severity, magnitude and duration of global or regional pandemics, epidemics or other
health crises are uncertain and difficult to predict. A pandemic, such as COVID-19, or other epidemic
or contagious disease outbreak could impact our business operations, demand for our products and
services, in-stock positions, costs of doing business, access to inventory, supply chain operations,
the extent and duration of measures to try to contain the spread of a virus or other disease (such as
travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, limitations on large gatherings,
business and government shutdowns and other restrictions on retailers), our ability to predict future
performance, exposure to litigation and our financial performance, among other things. In the event
of any global or regional health crisis, customer demand for certain products may fluctuate, customer
behaviors may change and consumer disposable income could be negatively impacted, which may challenge
our ability to anticipate and/or adjust inventory levels to meet that demand. Other factors and
uncertainties may include, but are not limited to: the severity and duration of pandemics, epidemics
or other health crises, including disease outbreaks in areas in which we and our suppliers operate;
increased operational costs; evolving macroeconomic factors, including general economic uncertainty,
unemployment rates and recessionary pressures; unknown consequences on our business performance and
initiatives stemming from the substantial investment of time, capital and other resources to a
pandemic or other health crisis response; the effectiveness and extent of administration of
vaccinations and medical treatments; the pace of recovery when any such pandemic or other health
crisis subsides; and the long-term impact of a pandemic or other health crisis on our business,
including consumer behaviors. These risks and their impacts are difficult to predict and could
otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations and our financial performance.
To the extent that a future pandemic or epidemic occurs, such events may also heighten other risks
described in this section, including but not limited to those related to consumer behavior and
expectations, competition, our reputation, implementation of strategic initiatives, cybersecurity
threats, payment-related risks, technology systems disruption, supply chain disruptions, labor
availability and cost, litigation and regulatory requirements.
Natural disasters, climate change, geopolitical events, catastrophic and other events could
materially adversely affect our financial performance.
The occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tropical storms, floods, fires,
earthquakes, tsunamis, cyclones, typhoons; weather conditions such as major or extended winter
storms, droughts and tornadoes, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise; geopolitical
tensions or events; and catastrophic and other events, such as war, civil unrest (including theft,
looting or vandalism), terrorist attacks or other acts of violence, including active shooter
situations (such as those that have occurred in our U.S. stores), or the loss of merchandise as a
result of shrink or theft in countries in which we operate, in which our suppliers are located or
regions goods are transported from or through, or in other areas of the world (such as in Ukraine and
Israel where wars currently exist, and armed hostilities in the Red Sea and surrounding areas through
which ocean carrier vessels travel to the Suez Canal) could adversely affect our operations and
financial performance.
Such events could result in physical damage to, or the complete loss of, one or more of our
properties, the closure of one or more stores, clubs and distribution or fulfillment centers,
limitations on store or club operating hours, the lack of an adequate work force in a market, the
inability of customers and associates to reach or have transportation to our stores and clubs
affected by such events, the evacuation of the populace from areas in which our stores, clubs and
distribution and fulfillment centers are located, the unavailability of our digital platforms to our
customers, changes in the purchasing patterns of consumers (including the frequency of visits by
consumers to physical retail locations, whether as a result of limitations on large gatherings,
travel and movement limitations or otherwise), such as Hurricane Otis that impacted our stores and
operations around Acapulco,
 17 
Mexico in fiscal 2024, although not material to our consolidated financial performance. Moreover,
these disasters and events can negatively impact consumers' disposable income, the temporary or long-
term disruption in the supply of products from some suppliers, the disruption in the transport of
goods from overseas, the disruption or delay in the delivery of goods to our distribution and
fulfillment centers or stores within a country in which we are operating, the reduction in the
availability of products in our stores, increases in the costs of procuring products as a result of
either reduced availability or economic sanctions, increased transportation costs (whether due to
fuel prices, fuel supply or otherwise), the disruption (whether directly or indirectly) of critical
infrastructure systems, banking systems, utility services or energy availability to our stores, clubs
and our facilities and the disruption in our communications with our stores, clubs and our other
facilities.
Furthermore, the long-term impacts of climate change, whether involving physical risks (such as
extreme weather conditions, drought or rising sea levels) or transition risks (such as regulatory or
technology changes) are expected to be widespread and unpredictable. Certain impacts of physical risk
may include: temperature changes that increase the heating and cooling costs at stores, clubs and
distribution or fulfillment centers; extreme weather patterns that affect the production or sourcing
of certain commodities; flooding and extreme storms that damage or destroy our buildings and
inventory; and heat and extreme weather events that cause long-term disruption or threats to the
habitability of the communities in which we operate. Relative to transition risk, certain impacts may
include: changes in energy and commodity prices driven by climate-related weather events; prolonged
climate-related events affecting macroeconomic conditions with related effects on consumer spending
and confidence; stakeholder perception of our engagement in climate-related policies; and new
regulatory requirements resulting in higher compliance risk and operational costs.
We bear the risk of losses incurred as a result of physical damage to, or destruction of, any stores,
clubs and distribution or fulfillment centers; theft, loss or spoilage of inventory; and business
interruption caused by such events. These events and their impacts could otherwise disrupt and
adversely affect our operations and could materially adversely affect our financial performance.
Moreover, our operations in the U.S. comprise a significant portion of our financial and operational
performance. Therefore, any of the above matters that uniquely impact or are specifically
concentrated in the U.S. could materially adversely affect our financial and operational performance
.
Risks associated with our suppliers could materially adversely affect our financial performance.
The products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers. Global
sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance. We
expect our suppliers to comply with applicable laws, including labor, safety, anti-corruption and
environmental laws, and to otherwise meet our required supplier standards of conduct. Our ability to
find qualified suppliers who uphold our standards, and to access products in a timely and efficient
manner and in the large volumes we may demand, is a significant challenge, especially with respect to
suppliers located and goods sourced outside the U.S.
Political and economic instability, as well as other impactful events and circumstances (such as
pandemic recovery related challenges, including supply chain disruption and production, labor
shortages and increases in labor costs) in the countries in which our suppliers and their
manufacturers are located or regions goods are transported from or through, the financial instability
of suppliers, suppliers not having the financial ability or capacity to fulfill their indemnification
obligations to us if called upon, thereby exposing us to the full cost of risks and claims,
suppliers' failure to meet our terms and conditions or our supplier standards (including our
responsible sourcing standards), labor problems experienced by our suppliers and their manufacturers,
the availability of raw materials to suppliers, merchandise safety and quality issues, disruption or
delay in the transportation of merchandise from the suppliers and manufacturers to our stores, clubs
and other facilities, including as a result of labor slowdowns at any port at which a material amount
of merchandise we purchase enters into the markets in which we operate, currency exchange rates,
transport availability and cost, transport security, inflation and other factors relating to the
suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control.
In addition, U.S. and international trade policies, tariffs and other restrictions on the exportation
and importation of goods, trade sanctions imposed between certain countries and entities, the
limitation on the exportation or importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain
materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control.
These and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our
operations and financial performance.
If the quality or safety of products we sell in stores or online fails to meet our customers'
expectations or regulatory standards, we could lose customers, incur liability for any injuries
caused by a product we sell or otherwise experience a material impact to our brand, reputation and
financial performance.
Our customers count on us to provide them with quality products at an affordable price. Occasionally,
the quality of products that we source from our suppliers fails to meet customer expectations. In
many cases, these products are subject to regulatory action or recall. For general merchandise, this
could be because the product fails to meet safety standards. For food products, it could be because
the product is a source of foodborne illness. For health and wellness products, it could be because
the product does not produce the expected result for the customer or harms the customer. Any of these
factors could cause customers to avoid purchasing certain products from us, or to choose to buy
products from a different retailer, even if the quality issue is
 18 
outside of our control. Any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and
costly to reestablish. When a product we sell does not meet quality or safety standards, there is an
increased risk of liability for harm the product may cause our customers. While we rely on our
suppliers to meet our safety and quality expectations, and to indemnify us if their products do not,
certain suppliers may not have the financial capacity or ability to fulfill their indemnification
obligations. In that case, we are exposed to the full cost of liability claims. Any issue regarding
the quality or safety of products we sell, regardless of the cause, could adversely affect our brand,
reputation and financial performance.
If the quality or safety of products offered for sale on our third-party marketplace fails to meet
our customers' expectations or regulatory standards, we could be held directly liable, lose
customers, become subject to regulatory enforcement or otherwise experience reputational harm.
Some of the products customers buy from our website are sold by third parties, which we refer to as
marketplace transactions. While that transaction ultimately occurs between the third-party seller and
the customer, some regulators and courts have taken a view that the retailer is responsible for
marketplace transactions that occur on a retailer's digital platform. Unsettled law on whether a
retailer is responsible for intellectual property or product liability claims related to marketplace
transactions creates additional risk. Any unfavorable changes or legal interpretations could further
expose us to liability. In addition, poor quality or safety of third-party products offered for sale
on our platforms could erode customer trust, leading to loss of sales, reduction in transactions and
deterioration of our competitive position. In addition, we may face reputational, financial and other
risks, including liability, for third-party products offered for sale on our platform that are
controversial, counterfeit, pirated or stolen or that infringe the intellectual property rights of
others. We may not be able to collect sufficient damages for these types of breaches from third-party
sellers. Furthermore, a regulator may view us as having responsibility for regulatory compliance of
the third-party products offered for sale on our platform. Although we have marketplace compliance
controls in place and impose contractual terms on sellers to prohibit sales of non-compliant
products, we may not be able prevent sellers from offering prohibited items for sale, enforce such
terms, or fully protect against regulatory risk. Any of these events could have a material adverse
impact on our business and results of operations and impede the execution of our eCommerce growth and
enterprise strategy.
We rely extensively on information and financial systems to process transactions, summarize results
and manage our business. Disruptions in our systems could harm our ability to conduct our operations.
Given the number of individual transactions we have each year, it is crucial that we maintain
uninterrupted operation of our business-critical information systems. Our information systems are
subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures,
computer viruses, worms, other malicious computer programs, denial-of-service attacks, security
incidents and breaches from a variety of threat actors, including both cybercriminals and nation
state-sponsored actors, catastrophic events such as fires, major or extended winter storms,
tornadoes, earthquakes and hurricanes, usage errors by our associates or contractors, civil or
political unrest or armed hostilities. The availability of our information systems and the integrity
of data are essential to our business operations, including the processing of transactions,
management of our associates, facilities, logistics, inventories, physical stores and clubs and our
online operations. Our information systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning
cannot account for all eventualities. If our systems are damaged, breached, attacked, interrupted or
otherwise cease to function properly, we may have to make a significant investment to repair or
replace them, and may experience loss or corruption of data as well as suffer interruptions in our
business operations in the interim. Any interruption to the availability of our information systems
or corruption of our data may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of
operations. In addition, the cost of securing our systems against failure or attack is considerable,
and increases in these costs, particularly in the wake of a breach or failure, could be significant.
In addition, we frequently update our information technology hardware, software, processes and
systems. The risk of system disruption is increased when significant system changes are undertaken.
If we fail to timely or successfully integrate and update our information systems and processes, we
may fail to realize the cost savings or operational benefits anticipated to be derived from these
initiatives. For example, during the first quarter of the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024, we
initiated an upgrade to our existing financial system, including our general ledger and other
applications. If we are unable to implement this upgrade as planned, the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting could be adversely affected; our ability to assess those
controls adequately could be delayed; and our reputation, business, results of operations, financial
condition and cash flows could be negatively impacted.
If the technology-based systems that give our customers the ability to shop with us online and enable
us to deliver products and services do not function effectively, our operating results, as well as
our ability to grow our omni-channel business globally, could be materially adversely affected.
Increasingly, customers are using computers, tablets and smart phones to shop with us and with our
competitors and to do comparison shopping. We use social media, online advertising and email to
interact with our customers and as a means to enhance their shopping experience. As a part of our
omni-channel sales strategy, we offer various pickup, delivery and shipping programs including
options where many products available for purchase online can be picked up by the customer or member
at a local Walmart store or Sam's Club, which provides additional customer traffic at such stores and
clubs. Omni-
 19 
channel retailing is a rapidly evolving part of the retail industry and of our operations around the
world, and we continue to make investments in supply chain automation to support our omni-channel
strategy. We must anticipate and meet our customers' changing expectations while adjusting for
technology investments and developments in our competitors' operations through focusing on the
building and delivery of a seamless shopping experience across all channels by each operating
segment. Moreover, some of the various technology systems and services on which we rely are provided
and managed by third-party service providers. To the extent either our or such other third-party
systems and services do not perform or function as anticipated, whether because of an inherent flaw
in the technology, a faulty implementation or a cybersecurity incident, such failure can
significantly interfere with our ability to meet our customers' changing expectations. Any disruption
or failure on our part to provide attractive, user-friendly and secure digital platforms that offer a
wide assortment of merchandise and services at competitive prices and with low cost and rapid
delivery options and that continually meet the changing expectations of online shoppers and
developments in online and digital platform merchandising and related technology in a cost-efficient
manner could place us at a competitive disadvantage, result in the loss of eCommerce and other sales,
harm our reputation with customers, have a material adverse impact on the growth of our eCommerce
business globally and have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.
Any failure to maintain the privacy or security of the information relating to our company,
customers, members, associates, business partners and vendors, whether as a result of cyberattacks on
our information systems or otherwise, could damage our reputation, result in litigation or other
legal actions against us, result in fines, penalties, and liability, cause us to incur substantial
additional costs and materially adversely affect our business and operating results.
Like most retailers, we process in our information systems personal information and/or payment
information about our customers and members, and we also process information concerning our
associates and vendors. In addition, our health and wellness business operations, the Walmart Health
locations, and third-party service providers who handle information on our behalf, store and maintain
personal health information. Some of this information is stored digitally in connection with the
digital platforms and technologies that we use to conduct and facilitate our various businesses. We
utilize third-party service providers for a variety of reasons, including, without limitation, for
digital storage technology, compute capacity, content delivery to customers and members, back-office
support and other functions. Such providers may have access to information we hold about our
customers, members, associates, business partners or vendors. In addition, our eCommerce operations
depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including
information permitting cashless payments.
Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and those threats and the means for disrupting or obtaining access
to information systems or information stored in digital and other storage media are becoming
increasingly sophisticated and frequent, and in some cases, they may lead to successful attacks.
Unauthorized activities directed against information systems and devices, whether our own or those of
our third-party service providers and vendors, have resulted in cybersecurity incidents, including
malware, ransomware, denial of service attacks or phishing incidents. We expect that our information
systems and those of our third-party service providers, vendors and suppliers will continue to
experience such attempted attacks in the future, which could include disruptions to our supply chain
system. Cyberattacks and threat actors can be sponsored by particular nation-states, or be the work
of sophisticated criminal organizations, insiders (including our associates or contractors) or third
parties, each with a wide-range of motives and expertise. We and the businesses with which we
interact have experienced and continue to experience incidents and threats to data and information
systems. These incidents and threats have included and are likely to continue to include both random
and targeted cyberattacks, computer viruses, phishing incidents, worms, bot attacks, ransomware or
other destructive or disruptive software and attempts to misappropriate customer information,
including credit card and payment information, and cause system failures and disruptions. The
increased use of remote work infrastructure in recent years has also increased the possible attack
surfaces to be exploited. Our logging capabilities, or the logging capabilities of third parties, are
also not always complete or sufficiently detailed, affecting our ability to fully investigate and
understand the scope of security events. As noted above, some of our information systems and those of
our third-party service providers have experienced cybersecurity incidents or breaches and, although
to date they have not had a material adverse effect on our operating results, there can be no
assurance of a similar result in the future.
Our digital platforms, which are increasingly important to our business and continue to grow in
complexity and scope, and the systems on which they run, including those applications and systems
used in legacy operations and acquired eCommerce, technology or other businesses, are regularly
subject to cyberattacks. Those attacks involve attempts to impede the operations of our system or
gain unauthorized access to our eCommerce websites (including marketplace platforms) or mobile
commerce applications to obtain and misuse customers' or members' information including personal
information and/or payment information and related risks discussed in this I tem 1A . Such attacks,
if successful, may result in potential data misuse and/or loss and may create denials of service or
otherwise disable, degrade or sabotage the information systems that enable or support one or more of
our digital platforms or otherwise significantly disrupt our customers' and members' shopping
experience, our supply chain integrity and continuity and our ability to efficiently operate our
business. If we are unable to maintain the security of the information systems that enable or support
our digital platforms and keep them operating within acceptable parameters, we could suffer loss of
sales, reductions in transactions, reputational damage and deterioration of our competitive
 20 
position and incur liability for any damage to customers, members or others whose personal or
confidential information is unlawfully obtained and misused, any of which events could have a
material adverse impact on our business and results of operations and impede the execution of our
strategy for the growth of our business.
Associate error or malfeasance, faulty password management, social engineering or other
vulnerabilities and irregularities may also result in a defeat of our security measures or those of
our third-party service providers and a compromise or breach of our or their information systems.
Moreover, the hardware, software or applications that comprise our information system and networked
environment may have vulnerabilities or defects of design, coding, manufacture or operations that
could be intentionally exploited or inadvertently used in a manner that could compromise information
security. Given the age, size and complexity of these information systems and our networked
environment, patches for certain vulnerabilities may not exist and, even where patches or other risk-
mitigating activities are available, the deployment of patches or execution of risk-mitigating
actions may not occur before an underlying vulnerability is exploited by threat actors or
inadvertently results in the compromise of our information systems or data.
Any compromise of our information systems or of those of businesses with which we interact, which
results in regulated data or confidential information being accessed, obtained, damaged, disclosed,
destroyed, modified, lost or used by unauthorized persons could harm our reputation and expose us to
regulatory actions (including, with respect to health information, liability under the Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or "HIPAA"), customer attrition, remediation
expenses and claims from customers, members, associates, vendors, financial institutions, payment
card networks and other persons, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business
operations, financial position and results of operations.
Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage
systems or data change frequently and may not immediately produce signs of a compromise, we may be
unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures, or detect the
activities of a threat actor. Even if we detect a cybersecurity incident, the nature and extent of
that cybersecurity incident may not be immediately clear. Based on the sophistication of the threat
actors and the size and complexity of our information systems and networked environment, among other
factors, an investigation into a cybersecurity incident could take a significant amount of time to
complete. We may not understand or appreciate that what is detected and treated as multiple
individual cybersecurity incidents or events may be associated with the coordinated actions of a
single threat actor. In addition, while our investigation of a cybersecurity incident is ongoing, we
may not know the full extent of the harm caused by a threat actor, and such harm may spread both
internally and to certain customers, vendors, or other third parties. These factors may inhibit our
ability to provide rapid, complete and reliable information about the cybersecurity incident to
customers, counterparties and regulators, as well as the public. It may also not be clear how best to
contain and remediate any harm caused by the cybersecurity incident, and certain errors or actions
could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated. Any or all of these
factors could further increase the costs and consequences of a cybersecurity incident on our business
operations, financial position and results of operations.
To the extent that any cyberattack, ransomware or incursion in our or one of our third-party service
provider's information systems results in the loss, damage, misappropriation or other compromise of
information, we may be materially adversely affected by claims from customers, members, financial
institutions, regulatory authorities, payment card networks and others.
Our compliance programs, information technology and enterprise risk management efforts cannot
eliminate all systemic risk. Disruptions in our systems caused by associate error or malfeasance,
security incidents, breaches or cyberattacks – including attacks on those parties we do business with
(such as strategic partners, suppliers, banks or utility companies) – could harm our ability to
conduct our operations, which may have a material effect on us, may result in losses that could have
a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations, or may have a cascading
effect that adversely impacts our partners, third-party service providers, customers, members,
financial services firms and other third parties that we interact with on a regular basis.
Our reputation with our customers and members is important to the success of our enterprise strategy,
which combines traditional retail, membership models, marketplaces, financial services, healthcare,
and other customer and business services into a series of interconnected assets to make it seamless
for customers to interact with us. Security-related events could be widely publicized and could
materially adversely affect our reputation with our customers, members, associates, vendors and
shareholders, could harm our competitive position particularly with respect to our eCommerce
operations, and could result in a material reduction in our net sales in our eCommerce operations, as
well as in our stores thereby materially adversely affecting our operations, net sales, growth rates,
operating income, results of operations, financial position, cash flows and liquidity. Such events
could also result in the release to the public of confidential information about our operations and
financial position and performance and could result in litigation or other legal actions against us
or the imposition of penalties, fines, fees or liabilities, which may not be covered by our insurance
policies. Moreover, a security compromise or operationally impactful malware event, such as
ransomware, could require us to devote significant management resources to address the problems
created by the issue and to expend significant additional resources to upgrade further the security
measures we employ to guard personal and confidential information against cyberattacks and other
attempts to access or otherwise compromise such information and could result in a disruption of our
operations, particularly our digital operations.
 21 
We accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash, checks, credit and debit cards,
electronic benefits transfer (EBT) cards, mobile payments and our private label credit cards and gift
cards, and we may offer new payment options over time, which may have information security risk
implications. As a retailer accepting debit and credit cards for payment, we are subject to various
industry data protection standards and protocols, such as payment network security operating
guidelines and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. We cannot be certain that the
security measures we or our third-party suppliers maintain are able to detect, prevent or contain
cyberattacks, cyberterrorism, security incidents, breaches or other compromises from malware,
ransomware or other threats that are known or may be developed in the future. In certain
circumstances, our contracts with payment card processors and payment card networks (such as Visa,
Mastercard, American Express and Discover) generally require us to adhere to payment card network
rules which could make us liable to payment card issuers and others if information in connection with
payment cards and payment card transactions that we process is compromised, which liabilities could
be substantial.
Additionally, through various financial service partners and our ONE fintech venture, we offer
various services such as money transfers, digital payment platforms, bill payment, money orders,
check cashing, prepaid access, co-branded credits cards, installment lending and earned wage access.
These products and services require us to comply with legal and regulatory requirements, including
those related to privacy, information security, anti-money laundering and sanctions regimes and
consumer protection, under both U.S. state and federal laws and regulations, as well as those of
certain other countries. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines,
sanctions, penalties and harm to our reputation.
We also have compliance obligations associated with privacy laws enacted to protect and regulate the
collection, use, retention, disclosure and transfer of personal information, which include liability
for security and privacy breaches. Among other obligations, breaches may trigger obligations under
U.S. federal and state laws and those in certain other countries to notify affected individuals,
government agencies and the media. Consequently, cybersecurity incidents that result in a data breach
could subject us to fines, sanctions and other legal liability and harm our reputation.
Changes in third-party reimbursements and contracts, type or scope of offerings of our health and
wellness business or the Walmart Health business could adversely affect our overall results of
operations, cash flows and liquidity.
We have retail pharmacy operations in our Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments across the U.S. and in
various of our international markets such as Canada and Mexico. We also provide management services
to Walmart Health centers that offer medical, dental, behavioral health and other health services in
a number of states, as well as a national telehealth service provider. In addition, our 10-year
collaboration with UnitedHealth Group includes agreements for Walmart Health to provide value-based
care to patients in certain areas of the U.S., among other initiatives.
A large majority of our retail pharmacy net sales are generated by filling prescriptions for which we
receive payment through established contractual relationships with third-party payers and payment
administrators, such as private insurers, governmental agencies and pharmacy benefit managers
("PBMs"). Our retail pharmacy operations are subject to numerous risks, including: reductions in the
third-party reimbursement rates for drugs; changes in our payer mix (i.e., shifts in the relative
distribution of our pharmacy customers across drug insurance plans and programs toward plans and
programs with less favorable reimbursement terms); changes in third-party payer drug formularies
(i.e., the schedule of prescription drugs approved for reimbursement or which otherwise receive
preferential coverage treatment); growth in, and our participation in or exclusion from, pharmacy
payer network arrangements, including exclusive and preferred pharmacy network arrangements operated
by PBMs and/or any insurance plan or program; increases in the prices we pay for brand name and
generic prescription drugs we sell; increases in the administrative burdens associated with seeking
third-party reimbursement; changes in the frequency with which new brand name pharmaceuticals become
available to consumers; introduction of lower cost generic drugs as substitutes for existing brand
name drugs for which there was no prior generic drug competition; changes in drug mix (i.e., the
relative distribution of drugs customers purchase at our pharmacies between brands and generics);
changes in the health insurance market generally; changes in the scope of or the elimination of
Medicare Part D or Medicaid drug programs; increased competition from other retail pharmacy
operations including competitors offering online retail pharmacy options and/or home delivery
options; further consolidation and strategic alliances among third-party payers, PBMs or purchasers
of drugs; overall economic conditions and the ability of our pharmacy customers to pay for drugs
prescribed for them to the extent the costs are not reimbursed by a third-party; failure to meet any
performance or incentive thresholds to which our level of third-party reimbursement may be subject;
changes in laws or regulations or the practices of third-party payers and PBMs related to the use of
third-party financial assistance to assist our pharmacy customers with paying for drugs prescribed
for them; and any additional changes in the state or federal regulatory environment for the retail
pharmacy industry and the pharmaceutical industry, including as a result of health reform efforts,
and other changes to or novel interpretations of existing state or federal laws, rules and
regulations that affect our retail pharmacy business.
If the supply of certain pharmaceuticals provided by one or more of our vendors were to be disrupted
for any reason, our pharmacy operations could be severely affected until at least such time as we
could obtain a new supplier for such pharmaceuticals. Any such disruption could cause reputational
damage and result in a significant number of our pharmacy customers transferring their prescriptions
to other pharmacies.
 22 
Walmart Health clinical operations are also subject to numerous risks, including but not limited to:
reductions in the third-party reimbursement rates for services; changes in our payer mix; changes in
the health insurance market generally; our inability to retain and negotiate favorable contracts with
private third-party payers, including managed care plans; competition for patients from other
healthcare providers, including those that offer telehealth services; changes to healthcare provider
utilization practices and treatment methodologies; trends toward value-based purchasing and price
transparency; overall economic conditions and the ability of patients to pay for services; staffing
challenges, including retention of a sufficient number and quality of healthcare professionals;
compliance with the complex and extensive laws and regulations governing the healthcare industry;
changes in laws and regulations, including as a result of health reform efforts; and healthcare
technology initiatives, including those related to patient data and interoperability; and public
health conditions.
One or a combination of the factors above may adversely affect the volumes of brand name and generic
pharmaceuticals we sell, our cost of sales associated with our retail pharmacy operations, and the
net sales and gross margin of those operations or result in the loss of cross-store or cross-club
selling opportunities. In addition, these and other factors may adversely affect the type, volume and
mix of services we provide, the reimbursement we receive for health and wellness services rendered,
and the scope and pace of expansion of Walmart Health and related offerings. Any of these
developments could, in turn, adversely affect our overall net sales, other results of operations,
cash flows and liquidity.
Our failure to attract and retain qualified associates, increases in wage and benefit costs, changes
in laws and other labor issues could materially adversely affect our financial performance.
Our ability to continue to conduct and expand our operations depends on our ability to attract and
retain a large and growing number of qualified associates globally. Our ability to meet our labor
needs, including our ability to find qualified personnel to fill positions that become vacant at our
existing stores, clubs, distribution and fulfillment centers and corporate offices, while controlling
our associate wage and related labor costs, is generally subject to numerous external factors,
including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force of the
markets in which we operate, unemployment levels within those markets, prevailing wage rates,
changing demographics, health and other insurance costs and adoption of new or revised employment and
labor laws and regulations. Additionally, our ability to successfully execute organizational changes,
including our enterprise strategy and management transitions within our senior leadership, and to
effectively motivate and retain associates are critical to our business success. We compete for
talent with other retail and non-retail businesses, including, for example, technology, health and
wellness and fintech businesses, and invest significant resources in training and motivating our
associates. Increased competition among potential employers at all levels, including senior
management and executive levels, could result in increased associate costs or make it more difficult
to recruit and retain associates. If we are unable to locate, attract or retain qualified personnel,
or manage leadership transition successfully, the quality of service we provide to our customers may
decrease and our financial performance may be adversely affected.
In addition, if our costs of labor or related costs increase for other reasons or if new, revised or
novel interpretations of existing labor laws, rules or regulations or healthcare laws, including
those related to worker classification, are adopted or implemented that further increase our labor
costs, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected.
 Financial Risks 
Failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance could adversely affect the market
price and volatility of our stock.
We believe that the price of our stock generally reflects high market expectations for our future
operating results. Any failure to meet or delay in meeting these expectations, including our
consolidated net sales, consolidated operating income, growth rates, eCommerce growth rates,
advertising and other higher-margin initiatives (which is expected to help drive our operating income
growth at a rate faster than net sales over the long term), capital expenditures, comparable store
and club sales growth rates or earnings and adjusted earnings per share could cause the market price
of our stock to decline, as could changes in our dividend or stock repurchase programs or policies,
changes in our effective tax rates, changes in our financial estimates and recommendations by
securities analysts or, failure of our performance to compare favorably to that of other retailers
may have a negative effect on the price of our stock.
Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may materially adversely affect our financial performance and
our reported results of operations.
Our operations in countries other than the U.S. are conducted primarily in the local currencies of
those countries. Our Consolidated Financial Statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, and to
prepare those financial statements we must translate the amounts of the assets, liabilities, net
sales, other revenues and expenses of our operations outside of the U.S. from local currencies into
U.S. dollars using exchange rates for the current period. In recent years, fluctuations in currency
exchange rates that were unfavorable have had adverse effects on our reported results of operations.
As a result of such translations, fluctuations in currency exchange rates from period-to-period that
are unfavorable to us may also result in our Consolidated Financial Statements reflecting significant
adverse period-over-period changes in our financial
 23 
performance or reflecting a period-over-period improvement in our financial performance that is not
as robust as it would be without such fluctuations in the currency exchange rates. Such unfavorable
currency exchange rate fluctuations will adversely affect the reported performance of our Walmart
International operating segment and have a corresponding adverse effect on our reported consolidated
results of operations.
We may pay for products we purchase for sale in our stores, clubs and eCommerce platforms around the
world with a currency other than the local currency of the country in which the goods will be sold.
When we must acquire the currency to pay for such products and the exchange rates for the payment
currency fluctuate in a manner unfavorable to us, our cost of sales may increase and we may be unable
or unwilling to change the prices at which we sell those goods to address that increase in our costs,
with a corresponding adverse effect on our gross profit. Consequently, unfavorable fluctuations in
currency exchange rates have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our results of
operations.
Legal, Tax, Regulatory, Compliance, Reputational and Other Risks
Our international operations subject us to legislative, judicial, accounting, legal, regulatory, tax,
political and economic risks and conditions specific to the countries or regions in which we operate,
which could materially adversely affect our business or financial performance.
In addition to our U.S. operations, we operate retail and eCommerce businesses in Africa, Canada,
Central America, Chile, China, India and Mexico.
During fiscal 2024, our Walmart International operations generated approximately 18% of our
consolidated net sales. Walmart International's operations in various countries also source goods and
services from other countries. Our future operating results in these countries could be negatively
affected by a variety of factors, most of which are beyond our control. These factors include
political conditions, including political instability, local and global economic conditions, legal
and regulatory constraints, such as regulation of product and service offerings including regulatory
restrictions (such as foreign ownership restrictions) on eCommerce and retail operations in
international markets, such as India, restrictive governmental actions (such as trade protection
measures or nationalization), antitrust and competition law regulatory matters (such as those
underway in Canada, Mexico and India (relating to our Flipkart subsidiary)), local product safety and
environmental laws, tax regulations, local labor laws, anti-money laundering laws and regulations,
trade policies, foreign exchange or currency regulations, laws and regulations regarding consumer and
data protection, and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate, now or in
the future.
Changing our operations in accordance with new or changed restrictions on international trade or
newly imposed sanctions can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to our operations, and such
restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and we may not be able to effectively
mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. In addition, tensions between nation-state
governments and conflicts of laws may lead to challenges for our operations. If disputes and
conflicts further escalate in the future, actions by governments in response could be significantly
more severe and restrictive and could adversely affect our business or financial performance and our
reputation. Political uncertainty surrounding trade and other international disputes could also have
a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could also adversely affect our business
or financial performance and our reputation. The economies of some of the countries in which we have
operations have in the past suffered from high rates of inflation and currency devaluations, which,
if they recur, could adversely affect our financial performance. Other factors which may impact our
international operations include foreign trade, monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. and of other
countries, laws, regulations and other activities of foreign governments, agencies and similar
organizations, and risks associated with having numerous facilities located in countries that have
historically been less stable than the U.S. Additional risks inherent in our international operations
generally include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations,
adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights in
countries other than the U.S. The various risks inherent in doing business in the U.S. generally also
exist when doing business outside of the U.S., and may be exaggerated by the difficulty of doing
business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture, geopolitical tensions or
events, laws and regulations.
In foreign countries in which we have operations, a risk exists that our associates, contractors or
agents could, in contravention of our policies, engage in business practices prohibited by U.S. laws
and regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or U.S. sanctions laws
and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries. We maintain global policies which
appropriately regulate such business practices and have in place global compliance programs designed
to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations. Nevertheless, we remain subject to the risk
that one or more of our associates, contractors or agents, including those based in or from countries
where practices that violate such U.S. laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other
countries may be customary, will engage in business practices that are appropriately regulated by our
policies, circumvent our compliance programs and, by doing so, violate such laws and regulations. Any
such violations, even if prohibited by our internal policies, could subject us to fines and penalties
and adversely affect our business or financial performance and our reputation.
 24 
Changes in tax and trade laws, regulations and interpretations could materially adversely affect our
financial performance.
In fiscal 2024, our Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club operating segments generated approximately 82% of our
consolidated net sales. Significant changes in tax and trade policies, including tariffs and
government regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries where we source many of
the products we sell in our stores and clubs could have an adverse effect on our business and
financial performance. A significant portion of the general merchandise we sell in our U.S. stores
and clubs is manufactured in other countries. Any such actions including the imposition of further
tariffs on imports could increase the cost to us of such merchandise (whether imported directly or
indirectly) and cause increases in the prices at which we sell such merchandise to our customers,
which could materially adversely affect the financial performance of our U.S. and international
operations as well as our business.
We are subject to income taxes, other taxes and tax collection and reporting obligations in both the
U.S. and the foreign jurisdictions in which we currently operate or have historically operated. The
determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and current and deferred tax assets and
liabilities requires judgment and estimation. Our taxes could be materially adversely affected by
earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher
than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, by changes in the valuation
of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in worldwide tax laws, tax rates,
regulations or accounting principles and the interpretations of those rules. In addition, we also may
not have sufficient notice to enable us to build systems and adopt processes to properly comply with
new reporting or collection obligations by the effective date of those obligations.
We are also exposed to future tax legislation, as well as the issuance of future regulations and
changes in administrative interpretations of existing tax laws, and changes in transfer pricing
arrangements with our subsidiaries, any of which can impact our or our subsidiaries current and
future years' tax provision. The effect of such changes in tax law, changes in administrative
interpretations of existing tax laws or changes in transfer pricing arrangements could also have a
material effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. In the U.S., the Tax
Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the "Tax Act") significantly changed federal income tax laws that affect
U.S. corporations. As further guidance is issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, the Internal
Revenue Service, and other standard-setting bodies, any resulting changes in our estimates will be
treated in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance. Compliance with the Tax Act and any
other new tax rules, regulations, guidance and interpretations, including collecting information not
regularly produced by us or unexpected changes in our estimates, may require us to incur additional
costs and could affect our results of operations.
In addition, legislatures and taxing authorities in many jurisdictions in which we operate may enact
changes to or seek to enforce novel interpretations of their tax rules. These changes could include
modifications that have temporary effect and more permanent changes. For example, the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development (the "OECD"), the European Union and other countries
(including countries in which we operate) have committed to enacting substantial changes to numerous
long-standing tax principles impacting how large multinational enterprises are taxed. In particular,
the OECD's Pillar Two initiative introduces a 15% global minimum tax applied on a country-by-country
basis, which became effective in many jurisdictions in which we operate starting January 1, 2024. The
impact of these potential new rules as well as any other changes in domestic and international tax
rules and regulations could have a material effect on our effective tax rate.
Furthermore, we are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities
as well as subject to the prospective and retrospective effects of changing tax regulations,
legislation and interpretations. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the ultimate
tax outcome may materially differ from the tax amounts recorded in our Consolidated Financial
Statements and may materially affect our income tax provision, net income or cash flows in the period
or periods for which such determination and settlement is made.
Changes in and/or failure to comply with other laws, regulations and interpretations of such laws and
regulations specific to the businesses and jurisdictions in which we operate could materially
adversely affect our reputation, market position or our business and financial performance.
We operate in complex regulated environments in the U.S. and in other countries in which we operate
and could be materially adversely affected by changes to existing legal requirements including the
related interpretations and enforcement practices, new legal requirements and/or any failure to
comply with applicable regulations. In addition, the degree of regulatory, political, and media
scrutiny we face increases the likelihood that our efforts to adhere our practices and procedures to
comply with these laws and legal requirements may be subject to frequent or increasing challenges.
Our health and wellness operations in the U.S. and the operations of the Walmart Health locations are
subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations including, but not limited to,
those related to: licensing, reimbursement arrangements and other requirements and restrictions;
registration and regulation of pharmacies; dispensing and sale of controlled substances and products
containing pseudoephedrine; governmental (including Medicare and Medicaid) and commercial
reimbursement; data privacy and security and the sharing and interoperability of data, including
obligations and restrictions related to health information (such as those imposed under HIPAA);
billing and coding for healthcare services and properly handling overpayments; debt collection;
necessity and adequacy of healthcare services; relationships with referral
 25 
sources and referral recipients and other fraud and abuse issues, such as those addressed by anti-
kickback and false claims laws and patient inducement regulations; qualification of healthcare
practitioners; quality and standards of medical services and equipment; and the practice of the
professions of pharmacy, medical, dental and behavioral healthcare services, including limitations on
the corporate practice of medicine in certain states.
Health-related legislation at the federal and state level may have an adverse effect on our business
or require us to modify certain aspects of our operations. For example, in the U.S., the Drug
Enforcement Administration ("DEA") and various other regulatory authorities regulate the purchase,
distribution, maintenance and dispensing of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances. We are
required to hold valid DEA and state-level licenses, meet various security and operating standards
and comply with the federal and various state-controlled substance acts and related regulations
governing the sale, dispensing, disposal and holding of controlled substances. The DEA, the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers, including the
ability to seize or recall products and impose significant criminal, civil and administrative
sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations. In addition, there has been recent heightened
governmental and public scrutiny of pharmaceutical product pricing, which has resulted in federal and
state legislation and regulations, executive orders and other initiatives and proposals designed to
increase transparency in pharmaceutical product pricing and reform government program reimbursement
methodologies (for example, the Inflation Reduction Act, which includes, among other matters,
policies designed to impact drug prices and reduce drug spending by the federal government). Other
health reform efforts at the federal and state levels may also impact our business or require us to
modify certain aspects of our operations. We may not be able to predict the nature or success of
reform initiatives, and the resulting uncertainties may have an adverse effect on our business.
We are also governed by foreign, national and state laws and regulations of general applicability,
including laws and regulations related to competition and antitrust matters; protection of the
environment and health and safety matters, including exposure to, and the management and disposal of,
hazardous substances; food and drug safety, including drug supply chain security requirements; trade,
consumer protection, and safety, including the availability, sale, price label accuracy,
advertisement and promotion of products we sell and the financial services we offer (including
through our digital channels, stores and clubs, as well as our ONE fintech venture); anti-money
laundering prohibitions; consumer financial protection laws; economic, trade and other sanctions
matters; licensure, certification and enrollment with government programs; data privacy and
cybersecurity and the sharing and interoperability of data; working conditions, workplace health and
safety, equal employment opportunity, worker classification, employee benefit and other labor and
employment matters; and health and wellness related regulations for our pharmacy operations outside
of the U.S. In addition, certain financial services we offer or make available are subject to U.S.
and international legal and regulatory requirements, including those intended to help detect and
prevent money laundering, fraud and other illicit activity, as well as consumer financial protections
and sanctions laws. Failure to meet these requirements could affect the profitability of our business
activities; limit our ability to pursue business opportunities or conduct business in certain
jurisdictions; require changes to business practices or governance or alter our relationships with
our customers, partners and other third parties, including our ability to continue certain
relationships in Mexico, India or other international jurisdictions; result in increased costs
related to regulatory oversight and compliance, litigation-related settlements, judgments or
expenses, restitution to customers or the imposition of fines or monetary penalties. Increased U.S.
regulation of non-bank financial institutions may also result in additional requirements and scrutiny
of certain financial services we offer.
Increasing governmental and societal attention to ESG matters, including expanding mandatory and
voluntary reporting diligence, and disclosure topics such as climate change, sustainability
(including with respect to our supply chain), natural resources, waste reduction, energy, human
capital and risk oversight could expand the nature, scope and complexity of matters that we are
required to control, assess and report.
Data privacy and protection laws or customer expectations relating to the collection, use, retention,
disclosure, transfer and processing of personal information continue to undergo a rapid
transformation in the U.S. and in non-U.S. jurisdictions. Recently enacted state laws, such as the
California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA"), in a number of states that have become effective, or will
soon be effective, have created a substantially more complex regulatory regime associated with data-
handling practices. Moreover, other laws and regulations related to data-handling and privacy that
apply to our business, such as the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act, the European Union's
General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"), the United Kingdom's General Data Protection Regulation
(which implements the GDPR into U.K. law), China's Personal Information Protection Act ("PIPL"), and
similar legislation in Quebec Canada further increases the compliance obligations of our business.
Certain of these laws have required us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to
incur substantial costs and expenses to comply, which we anticipate will continue in the future.
These and other privacy and cybersecurity laws may carry significant potential damages and civil
penalties for noncompliance. For example, in the case of non-compliance with a material provision of
the GDPR (such as non-adherence to the core principles of processing personal data), regulators have
the authority to levy a fine in an amount that is up to the greater of €20 million or 4% of global
annual turnover (i.e., revenue) in the prior year. These administrative fines are discretionary and
based, in each case, on a multi-factored approach. Further, PIPL took effect in China in November
2021. PIPL raises the protection requirements for processing personal information and requires
government approval to either allow the access of personal information in China by someone outside of
China or conduct personal data transfers outside of China. Fines for PIPL violations range from
approximately RMB 50 million to up to 5% of
 26 
the infringing company's previous year's revenues generated from within China. We have made changes,
and we may in the future make additional adjustments to our business practices, to comply with the
personal information protection laws and regulations in China as they evolve. Residents in
jurisdictions with comprehensive privacy laws have rights to access, correct and require deletion of
their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing and receive detailed
information about how their personal information is used and may have a private right of action for
data breaches. Furthermore, our marketing and customer engagement activities are subject to
communications privacy laws such as the Telephone Consumer Protection Act. We may be subjected to
penalties and other consequences for noncompliance, including changing some portions of our business.
Even an unsuccessful challenge by customer or regulatory authorities of our activities could result
in adverse publicity, impact our reputation and could require a costly response from and defense by
us.
The impact of new laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations, as well as changes
in enforcement practices or regulatory scrutiny as to existing laws and regulations (including, but
not limited to, in the U.S., shifting enforcement priorities for existing antitrust, competition and
pricing laws, as well as proposed new rules and regulations) generally cannot be predicted, and
changes in applicable laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement
practices of existing laws and regulations may require extensive system and operational changes, be
difficult to implement, increase our operating costs, require significant capital expenditures, or
adversely impact the cost or attractiveness of the products or services we offer, or result in
adverse publicity and harm our reputation. If we fail to predict or respond adequately to changes,
including by implementing strategic and operational initiatives, or do not respond as effectively as
our competitors, our business, operations and financial performance may be adversely affected.
In addition, we may face audits or investigations by one or more government agencies relating to our
compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The regulatory, political and media scrutiny we
face, which may continue, amplifies these risks. To the extent a regulator or court disagrees with
our interpretation of these laws and determines that our practices are not in compliance with
applicable laws and regulations, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties that could
adversely affect the continued operation of our businesses, including: suspension of payments from
government programs; loss of required licenses and certifications; loss of authorizations to
participate in or exclusion from government programs, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs in
the U.S.; termination from contractual relationships, including those with our drug suppliers and
third-party payers; and significant fines or monetary damages. Failure to comply with applicable
legal or regulatory requirements in the U.S. or in any of the countries in which we operate could
result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation and have a material
adverse effect on our business operations, financial position and results of operations.
We are subject to risks related to litigation and other legal proceedings that may materially
adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and liquidity.
We operate in a highly regulated and litigious environment. We are involved in legal proceedings,
including litigation, arbitration and other claims, and investigations, inspections, audits, claims,
inquiries and similar actions by pharmacy, healthcare, tax, environmental and other governmental
authorities. We may also have indemnification obligations for legal commitments of certain businesses
we have divested. Legal proceedings, in general, and securities, derivative action and class action
and multi-district litigation, in particular, can be expensive and disruptive. Some of these suits
may purport or may be determined to be class actions and/or involve parties seeking large and/or
indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages, and may remain unresolved for several
years. For example, we are currently a defendant in a number of cases containing class or collective-
action allegations, or both, in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state wage
and hour laws, as well as a number of cases containing class-action allegations in which the
plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state consumer laws.
We have been responding to subpoenas, information requests and investigations from governmental
entities related to nationwide controlled substance dispensing and distribution practices involving
opioids. We are also a defendant in numerous litigation proceedings related to opioids, including the
consolidated multidistrict litigation entitled In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No.
2804) currently pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio and a lawsuit
filed against us by the United States Department of Justice in the District of Delaware in 2020.
Similar cases that name us also have been filed in state courts by state, local and tribal
governments, healthcare providers and other plaintiffs. Plaintiffs in these cases are seeking
compensatory and punitive damages, as well as injunctive relief including abatement. We have entered
into a settlement framework to resolve certain of these matters and accrued a liability for
approximately $3.3 billion, almost all of which was paid in fiscal 2024. We cannot predict the
ultimate number of opioids-related claims that may be filed or their outcomes and cannot reasonably
estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from opioids-related matters.
In addition, in July 2021, the Directorate of Enforcement in India issued a show cause notice to
Flipkart and other parties requesting the recipients show cause as to why further proceedings under
India's Foreign Direct Investment rules and regulations should not be initiated against them based on
alleged violations that related to a period prior to our acquisition of a majority stake in Flipkart
in 2018. Also, in October 2023, the main Mexican operating subsidiary of Wal-Mart de México was
notified of the initiation of a quasi-judicial administrative process against it for alleged relative
monopolistic practices in connection with the supply and wholesale distribution of certain consumer
goods, retail marketing practices of such consumer
 27 
goods and related services. Because this process is at an early stage, we cannot provide any
assurance as to the scope and outcome of this matter, and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or
range of loss that may arise from this matter.
We can provide no assurance as to the scope or outcome of any proceeding that might result from the
notice, the amount of proceeds we may receive in indemnification, and can provide no assurance as to
whether there will be a material adverse effect to our business or Consolidated Financial Statements.
We are also a defendant in litigation with the Federal Trade Commission regarding our money transfer
agent services and is also cooperating with and responding to subpoenas issued by the U.S. Attorney's
Office for the Middle District of Pennsylvania on behalf of the U.S. Department of Justice regarding
our consumer fraud prevention program and anti-money laundering compliance related to our money
transfer services, where we are an agent. We are unable to predict the outcome of the litigation or
investigations or any other related actions by governmental entities regarding these matters and can
provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of these matters and whether our business, financial
position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected. We discuss
in more detail these cases and other litigation to which we are party below under the caption " Item
3. Le gal Proceedings " and in Note 10 in the "Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements," which
are part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Our amended and restated bylaws designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole
and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our
shareholders, which could increase the costs for our shareholders to bring claims, discourage our
shareholders from bringing claims, or limit our shareholders' ability to obtain a favorable judicial
forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, associates or shareholders in such capacity.
Our bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole
and exclusive forum for claims, including derivative claims that are based upon a violation of a duty
by a current or former director, officer, associate or shareholder in such capacity or as to which
the Delaware General Corporation Law confers jurisdiction upon the Court of Chancery. The exclusive
forum provision may increase the costs for a shareholder to bring a claim or limit a shareholder's
ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that the shareholder finds favorable for disputes with
us or our directors, officers, associates or shareholders in such capacity, which may discourage such
lawsuits against us and such persons. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our
bylaws inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, the claims as to which they are intended to
apply, then we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other
jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial position or results of
operations. While the exclusive forum provision applies to state and federal law claims, our
shareholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with, and the exclusive forum provision
will not preclude or contract the scope of exclusive federal or concurrent jurisdiction for actions
brought under, the federal securities laws, including the Exchange Act, as amended, or the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
Our reputation may be adversely affected if we are not able to satisfy varied stakeholder
expectations with respect to our ESG goals.
We strive to deliver shared value through our business and our diverse stakeholders expect us to make
significant progress in certain ESG priority issue areas. Stakeholder expectations regarding ESG
matters continue to evolve and are not uniform. We have established, and may continue to establish,
various goals and initiatives on these matters, including with respect to climate change initiatives.
We cannot guarantee that we will achieve these goals and initiatives. Any failure, or perceived
failure, by us to achieve these goals and initiatives or to otherwise meet evolving and varied
stakeholder expectations could adversely affect our reputation. We periodically publish information
about our ESG priorities, strategies and progress on our corporate website and update our ESG
reporting from time to time. Achievement of these aspirations and goals is subject to risks and
uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control, and it is possible that we may fail, or be
perceived to have failed, in the achievement of our ESG goals or that certain of our customers,
associates, shareholders, investors, suppliers, business partners, government agencies and non-
governmental organizations might not be satisfied with our goals or our efforts toward achieving
those goals. Certain challenges we face in the achievement of our ESG objectives are also captured
within our ESG reporting, which is not incorporated by reference into and does not form any part of
this Annual Report on Form 10-K. A failure or perceived failure to meet our goals could adversely
affect public perception of our business, associate morale or customer or shareholder support.
 ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS 
None.
 ITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY 
Walmart seeks to build and maintain the trust of customers, associates, shareholders and other
stakeholders with respect to our use of technology and data. Our digital trust commitments, in line
with our Company's values of service, excellence, integrity and respect for the individual, provide a
foundation for our approach to cybersecurity.
 28 
The Board of Directors, committees of the Board of Directors and management coordinate risk oversight
and management responsibilities, and cybersecurity represents an important component of our overall
approach to enterprise risk management. In general, we seek to address cybersecurity risks through a
cross-functional approach focused on protecting business operations and preserving the
confidentiality, integrity and availability of information by identifying, preventing and mitigating
cybersecurity threats and effectively responding to cybersecurity incidents when they occur.
Board of Directors' oversight of risks from cybersecurity threats
Our Board of Directors, which has primary responsibility for overseeing risk management, has
delegated risk management oversight responsibility for information systems, information security,
data privacy and cybersecurity to the Audit Committee. Several of our Board members, including
certain members of our Audit Committee, have backgrounds or professional experience in risk
management, digital platforms, information technology or cybersecurity.
The Audit Committee receives periodic updates from our Chief Information Security Officer ("CISO"),
Chief Technology Officer ("CTO") and other members of management on risks related to information
systems, information security, data privacy and cybersecurity. Specific topics may include updates to
our company's approach to cybersecurity risk management; recent developments; key initiatives; the
threat landscape; trends; and the results of certain assessments and testing. The Board of Directors
receives regular reports from the Audit Committee chair on these and other risk-related matters as
deemed necessary. Our CISO or other members of management provide information to the Audit Committee
pursuant to risk-based escalation protocols for cybersecurity incidents that exceed established
reporting thresholds.
Management's role in assessing and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats
Our CISO leads Walmart's Information Security organization and has responsibility for overseeing our
Company's cybersecurity program. To operationalize our program, we deploy multidisciplinary teams,
including cybersecurity personnel and professionals, to address cybersecurity threats and respond to
cybersecurity incidents, including for those non-wholly owned subsidiaries whose systems have not
been fully integrated into Walmart's networks. Through ongoing engagement with these teams and
certain third-party service providers, our CISO monitors the prevention, detection, mitigation and
remediation of cybersecurity threats and incidents and reports cybersecurity incidents that reach
established thresholds to senior management and the Audit Committee, which are also analyzed for
external reporting requirements.
Our CISO has been a Walmart associate for over 30 years, has served in various roles in information
technology and information security at Walmart for almost 20 years, and has received industry-
recognized information security certifications. Our CTO, to whom the CISO reports, has served as
Walmart's CTO since 2019 and prior to that had experience managing technology and other risks at
several other large public companies.
 Risk Management and Strategy 
Our cybersecurity program is informed by various industry frameworks including the National Institute
of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure
Cybersecurity (NIST-CSF Version 1.1), which are reflected in our related policies, standards,
processes and practices. We may implement changes to our cybersecurity program when deemed necessary
based on updates to industry standards among other things. We have multiple layers of security
designed to detect and block cybersecurity events, as well as dedicated teams of cybersecurity
personnel and professionals, which assist our CISO in helping to assess, identify, monitor, detect
and manage cybersecurity risks, threats, vulnerabilities and incidents. We collaborate with public
and private entities and industry groups and engage third-party service providers to expand the
capabilities and capacity of our cybersecurity program when deemed necessary. Certain key components
of our cybersecurity program include the following:
Protecting our technology and information systems: When we implement significant changes to our
technologies or information systems, we conduct risk-based security and privacy impact assessments
and deploy technical safeguards that are designed to reasonably protect our technology and
information systems from cybersecurity threats. We actively monitor and proactively research
potential cybersecurity threats to our technologies and information systems. We use what we learn to
evolve our security controls over time to mitigate risks posed by such threats.
Incident response and recovery planning: We maintain incident response and recovery plans that
address our response to cybersecurity incidents, including incidents that we become aware of at third
parties that support our operations. These plans guide how we evaluate and assign incident severity
levels and reporting thresholds; escalate and engage incident response teams; and manage and mitigate
the related risks.
Third-party risk management: We maintain a risk-based approach to identifying and managing
cybersecurity threats presented to Walmart by third-party systems that support our operations, as
well as third-party users of our data and systems, including vendors, service providers and
subcontractors.
Training and awareness: We provide recurring information security training (which includes
cybersecurity training) to our associates and certain third parties based on access, risk, roles,
policies, standards and behaviors.
 29 
Assessments and testing: We engage in periodic assessment and testing of our policies, standards,
processes and practices that are designed to address cybersecurity threats. These efforts include
tabletop exercises, threat modeling, vulnerability testing and other exercises focused on evaluating
the effectiveness of our cybersecurity measures and planning. We regularly engage third parties to
assist with our assessments and testing. Where appropriate we adjust our cybersecurity policies,
standards, processes and practices accordingly based on internal and external assessment and testing
results.
Certain of Walmart's systems and those of our third-party service providers have experienced
cybersecurity incidents and threats. Based on the information available as of the date of this Annual
Report on Form 10-K, we are not aware of any risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a result
of any cybersecurity incidents, which have materially affected us or are reasonably likely to
materially affect us, including our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition.
Despite our security measures, however, there can be no assurance that we, or the third parties with
which we interact, will not experience a cybersecurity incident in the future that will materially
affect us. Additional information about cybersecurity risks we face is discussed in " Item 1A . Risk
Factors ," which should be read in conjunction with the information above.

We own office facilities in Bentonville, Arkansas, that serve as our principal office and own and
lease office facilities throughout the U.S. and internationally for operations as well as for field
and market management. The land on which our stores are located is either owned or leased by the
Company. We use independent contractors to construct our buildings. All store leases provide for
annual rentals, some of which escalate during the original lease or provide for additional rent based
on sales volume. Substantially all of the Company's store and club leases have renewal options, some
of which include rent escalation clauses. For further information on our distribution centers, see
the caption "Distribution" provided for each of our segments under " Item 1. Business ."
 ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
I. SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION: The Company is involved in legal proceedings arising in the normal
course of its business, including litigation, arbitration and other claims, and investigations,
inspections, subpoenas, audits, claims, inquiries and similar actions by governmental authorities. We
discuss certain legal proceedings in Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in "
Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data ," which is captioned "Contingencies," under the
sub-caption "Legal Proceedings." We refer you to that discussion for important information concerning
those legal proceedings, including the basis for such actions and, where known, the relief sought. We
provide the following additional information concerning those legal proceedings, including the name
of the lawsuit, the court in which the lawsuit is pending, and the date on which the petition
commencing the lawsuit was filed.
Prescription Opiate Litigation: In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) (the
"MDL"). The MDL is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio and includes
over 340 cases as of March 4, 2024. The liability phase of a single, two-county trial in one of the
MDL cases against a number of parties, including the Company, regarding opioid dispensing claims
resulted in a jury verdict on November 23, 2021, finding in favor of the plaintiffs as to the
liability of all defendants, including the Company. The abatement phase of the single, two-county
trial resulted in a judgment on August 17, 2022, that ordered all three defendants, including the
Company, to pay an aggregate amount of approximately $0.7 billion over fifteen years, on a joint and
several liability basis, and granted the plaintiffs injunctive relief. The Company has filed an
appeal with the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. The monetary aspect of the judgment is stayed pending
appeal, and the injunctive portion of the judgment went into effect on February 20, 2023. On
September 11, 2023, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals issued an order certifying certain questions
in the appeal for review by the Supreme Court of Ohio. On November 29, 2023, the Supreme Court of
Ohio accepted the request for certification, and the matter remains pending with that court. On
October 25, 2023, the MDL designated four cases brought by third-party payers as bellwether cases to
proceed through discovery. Additional bellwethers of cases brought by hospitals and other healthcare
providers may be designated in the future. In addition, there are over 50 other cases pending in
state and federal courts throughout the country against the Company as of March 4, 2024, as well as
other cases in Canada against Wal-Mart Canada Corp. and certain other subsidiaries of the Company.
The case citations and currently scheduled trial dates, where applicable, are listed on Exhibit 99.1
to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Opioid Settlement Framework: On November 15, 2022, the Company announced that it had agreed to a
Settlement Framework to resolve substantially all opioids-related lawsuits filed against the Company
by states, political subdivisions, and Native American tribes (other than the single, two-county
trial on appeal to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals as described above), as described in more
detail in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company now has settlement agreements
with all 50 states, including four states that previously settled with the Company, as well as the
District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and three other U.S. territories, that are intended to resolve
substantially all opioids-related lawsuits brought by state and local governments against the
Company. As described in more detail in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the
Settlement Framework became effective on September 6, 2023, and as of January 31, 2024 substantially
all of the original approximately $3.3 billion accrued liability for the Settlement Framework and
other settlements have been paid.
DOJ Opioid Civil Litigation: A civil complaint pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of
Delaware has been filed by the U.S. Department of Justice (the "DOJ") against the Company, in which
the DOJ alleges violations of the Controlled Substances Act related to nationwide distribution and
dispensing of opioids. U.S. v. Walmart Inc., et al., USDC, Dist. of DE, 12/22/20. The Company filed a
motion to dismiss the DOJ complaint on February 22, 2021. After the parties had fully briefed the
Company's motion to dismiss, the DOJ filed an amended complaint on October 7, 2022. On November 7,
2022, the Company filed a partial motion to dismiss the amended complaint. The Court held a hearing
on the partial motion to dismiss on January 18, 2024, and ordered the DOJ to file an amended
complaint. The DOJ filed that amended complaint on February 1, 2024, and Walmart filed a partial
motion to dismiss that complaint on February 6, 2024. On March 11, 2024, the Court granted in-part
Walmart's motion by dismissing the entirety of the DOJ's claims related to distribution and
dismissing the DOJ's claims arising under one of the DOJ's two dispensing liability theories. The
DOJ's claims arising under its other dispensing liability theory remain pending.

Opioids Related Securities Class Actions and Derivative Litigation : Three derivative complaints and
two securities class actions drawing heavily on the allegations of the DOJ complaint have been filed
in Delaware naming the Company and various current and former directors and certain current and
former officers as defendants. The plaintiffs in the derivative suits (in which the Company is a
nominal defendant) allege, among other things, that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties in
connection with oversight of opioids dispensing and distribution and that the defendants violated
Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, and are liable for contribution under Section 10(b) of the
Exchange Act in connection with the Company's disclosures about opioids. Two of the derivative suits
have been filed in the U.S. District Court in Delaware and those suits have been stayed pending
further developments in other opioids litigation matters. The other derivative suit has been filed in
the Delaware Court of Chancery. The defendants in the derivative suit pending in the Delaware Court
of Chancery moved to dismiss and/or to stay that case on December 21, 2021; the plaintiffs responded
by filing an amended complaint on February 22, 2022. On April 20, 2022, the defendants moved to
dismiss and/or stay proceedings on the amended complaint. In two orders issued on April 12 and 26,
2023, the Court of Chancery granted the defendants' motion to dismiss with respect to claims
involving the Company's distribution practices and denied the remainder of the motion, including the
Company's request to stay the litigation. On May 5, 2023, the Company's Board of Directors appointed
an independent Special Litigation Committee (the "SLC") to investigate the allegations regarding
certain current and former officers and directors named in the various proceedings regarding
oversight with respect to opioids. The Board has authorized the SLC to retain independent legal
counsel and such other advisors as the SLC deems appropriate in carrying out its duties. The
derivative matter pending in the Delaware Court of Chancery is stayed until the SLC completes its
investigation.
The securities class actions, alleging violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act
regarding the Company's disclosures with respect to opioids, purport to be filed on behalf of a class
of investors who acquired Walmart stock from March 30, 2016, through December 22, 2020. On May 11,
2021, the U.S. District Court in Delaware consolidated the class actions and appointed a lead
plaintiff and lead counsel. The defendants moved to dismiss the consolidated securities class action
on October 8, 2021. On October 14, 2022, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, which revised the
applicable putative class of investors to those who acquired Walmart stock from March 31, 2017,
through December 22, 2020. On November 16, 2022, the Company moved to dismiss the amended complaint.
That motion remains pending.

II. CERTAIN OTHER MATTERS:
Foreign Direct Investment Matters: In July 2021, the Directorate of Enforcement in India issued a
show cause notice to Flipkart Private Limited and one of its subsidiaries ("Flipkart"), and to
unrelated companies and individuals, including certain current and former shareholders and directors
of Flipkart. The notice requests the recipients to show cause as to why further proceedings under
India's Foreign Direct Investment rules and regulations (the "Rules") should not be initiated against
them based on alleged violations during the period from 2009 to 2015, prior to the Company's
acquisition of a majority stake in Flipkart in 2018. The notice is an initial stage of proceedings
under the Rules which could, depending upon the conclusions at the end of the initial stage, lead to
a hearing to consider the merits of the allegations described in the notice. If a hearing is
initiated and if it is determined that violations of the Rules occurred, the regulatory authority has
the authority to impose monetary and/or non-monetary relief. Flipkart has begun the process of
responding to the notice and, if the matter progresses to a consideration of the merits of the
allegations described in the notice is initiated, Flipkart intends to defend against the allegations
vigorously. Due to the fact that this process is in an early stage, the Company is unable to predict
whether the notice will lead to a hearing on the merits or, if it does, the final outcome of the
resulting proceedings. While the Company does not currently believe that this matter will have a
material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows,
the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope or outcome of any proceeding that might result
from the notice, the amount of the proceeds the Company may receive in indemnification from
individuals and entities that sold shares to the Company under the 2018 agreement pursuant to which
the Company acquired its majority stake in Flipkart, and can provide no assurance as to whether there
will be a material adverse effect to its business or its Consolidated Financial Statements.

III. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS: Item 103 of SEC Regulation S-K requires disclosure of certain
environmental matters when a governmental authority is a party to the proceedings and such
proceedings involve potential monetary sanctions that the Company reasonably believes will exceed an
applied threshold not to exceed $1 million.
In December 2021, the Office of the Attorney General of the State of California filed suit against
the Company, bringing enforcement claims regarding Walmart's management of waste consumer products at
its California facilities that are alleged to be hazardous. The suit was filed in Superior Court of
Alameda County, California, Case No. 21CV004367, People v. Walmart Inc. Trial is currently set for
September 30, 2024. The Company believes it has strong defenses and is vigorously defending this
litigation matter. While the Company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter, the
potential for penalties or settlement costs could exceed $1 million. Although the Company does not
believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position,
results of operations or cash flows, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome
of this matter and no assurance as to whether there will be a material adverse effect to its business
or its Consolidated Financial Statements.
In October 2023, the Company received a Finding of Violation from the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency (the "EPA") alleging violations of the Clean Air Act in connection with the Company's
refrigeration leak detection and repair program at certain of its facilities. The Company is
evaluating the findings and cooperating with the EPA in its investigation. The EPA may seek to impose
monetary and non-monetary penalties for the alleged violations of the Clean Air Act. Due to the fact
that this process is in an early stage, the Company is unable to predict the final outcome of this
matter. Although the Company does not believe this matter will have a material adverse effect on its
business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows, the Company can provide no
assurance as to the scope or outcome of this matter and no assurance as to whether there will be a
material adverse effect to its business or its Consolidated Financial Statements.
