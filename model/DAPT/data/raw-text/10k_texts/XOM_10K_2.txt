ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
Exxon Mobil Corporation was incorporated in the State of New Jersey in 1882. Divisions and affiliated
companies of ExxonMobil operate or market products in the United States and most other countries of
the world. Our principal business involves exploration for, and production of, crude oil and natural
gas; manufacture, trade, transport and sale of crude oil, natural gas, petroleum products,
petrochemicals, and a wide variety of specialty products; and pursuit of lower-emission business
opportunities including carbon capture and storage, hydrogen, lower-emission fuels, and lithium.
Affiliates of ExxonMobil conduct extensive research programs in support of these businesses.
Exxon Mobil Corporation has several divisions and hundreds of affiliates, many with names that
include ExxonMobil , Exxon , Esso, Mobil or XTO . For convenience and simplicity, in this report the
terms ExxonMobil, Exxon, Esso, Mobil, and XTO , as well as terms like Corporation , Company , our ,
we, and its , are sometimes used as abbreviated references to specific affiliates or groups of
affiliates. The precise meaning depends on the context in question.
In October 2023 the Corporation entered into a merger agreement with Pioneer Natural Resources
Company (Pioneer), an independent oil and gas exploration and production company, in exchange for
ExxonMobil common stock. The transaction is currently expected to close in the second quarter of
2024, subject to regulatory approvals. For additional information, see "Note 21: Mergers and
Acquisitions" in the Financial Section of this report.
The energy and petrochemical industries are highly competitive, both within the industries and also
with other industries in supplying the energy, fuel, and chemical needs of industrial and individual
consumers. Certain industry participants, including ExxonMobil, are expanding investments in lower-
emission energy and emission-reduction services and technologies. The Corporation competes with other
firms in the sale or purchase of needed goods and services in many national and international markets
and employs all methods of competition which are lawful and appropriate for such purposes.
Operating data and industry segment information for the Corporation are contained in the Financial
Section of this report under the following: “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations: Business Results” and “Note 18: Disclosures about Segments and
Related Information”. Information on oil and gas reserves is contained in the “Oil and Gas Reserves”
part of the “Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Activities” portion
of the Financial Section of this report.
ExxonMobil has a long-standing commitment to the development of proprietary technology. We have a
wide array of research programs designed to meet the needs identified in each of our businesses.
ExxonMobil held over 8 thousand active patents worldwide at the end of 2023. For technology licensed
to third parties, revenues totaled approximately $155 million in 2023. Although technology is an
important contributor to the overall operations and results of our Company, the profitability of each
business segment is not dependent on any individual patent, trade secret, trademark, license,
franchise, or concession.
ExxonMobil operates in a highly complex, competitive, and changing global energy business environment
where decisions and risks play out over time horizons that are often decades in length. This long-
term orientation underpins the Corporation's philosophy on talent development.
Talent development begins with recruiting exceptional candidates and continues with individually
planned experiences and training designed to facilitate broad development and a deep understanding of
our business across the business cycle. Our career-oriented approach to talent development results in
strong retention and an average length of service of about 30 years for our career employees.
Compensation, benefits, and workplace programs support the Corporation's talent management approach,
and are designed to attract and retain employees for a career through compensation that is market
competitive, long-term oriented, and highly differentiated by individual performance.
Over 60 percent of our global employee workforce is from outside the U.S., and over the past decade
39 percent of our global hires for management, professional and technical positions were female and
37 percent of our U.S. hires for management, professional and technical positions were minorities.
With over 160 nationalities represented in the company, we encourage and respect diversity of
thought, ideas, and perspective from our workforce. We consider and monitor diversity through all
stages of employment, including recruitment, training, and development of our employees. We also work
closely with the communities where we operate to identify and invest in initiatives that help support
local needs, including local talent and skill development.
The number of regular employees was 62 thousand, 62 thousand, and 63 thousand at years ended 2023,
2022, and 2021, respectively. Regular employees are defined as active executive, management,
professional, technical, administrative, and wage employees who work full time or part time for the
Corporation and are covered by the Corporation’s benefit plans and programs.

 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
ExxonMobil’s financial and operating results are subject to a variety of risks inherent in the global
oil, gas, and petrochemical businesses and the pursuit of lower-emission business opportunities. Many
of these risk factors are not within the company’s control and could adversely affect our business,
our financial and operating results, or our financial condition. These risk factors include:
 Supply and Demand 
The oil, gas, and petrochemical businesses are fundamentally commodity businesses. This means
ExxonMobil’s operations and earnings may be significantly affected by changes in oil, gas, and
petrochemical prices and by changes in margins on refined products. Oil, gas, petrochemical, and
product prices and margins in turn depend on local, regional, and global events or conditions that
affect supply and demand for the relevant commodity or product. Any material decline in oil or
natural gas prices could have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations, financial
condition, and proved reserves, especially in the Upstream segment. On the other hand, a material
increase in oil or natural gas prices could have a material adverse effect on the company’s
operations, especially in the Energy Products, Chemical Products, and Specialty Products segments.
Our pursuit of lower-emission business opportunities including carbon capture and storage, hydrogen,
lower-emission fuels, and lithium also depends on the growth and development of markets for those
products and services, including implementation of supportive government policies and developments in
technology to enable those products and services to be provided on a cost-effective basis at
commercial scale. See "Climate Change and the Energy Transition" in this Item 1A.
Economic conditions. The demand for energy and petrochemicals is generally linked closely with broad-
based economic activities and levels of prosperity. The occurrence of recessions or other periods of
low or negative economic growth will typically have a direct adverse impact on our results. Other
factors that affect general economic conditions in the world or in a major region, such as changes in
population growth rates, periods of civil unrest, government regulation or austerity programs, trade
tariffs or broader breakdowns in global trade, security or public health issues and responses, or
currency exchange rate fluctuations, can also impact the demand for energy and petrochemicals.
Sovereign debt downgrades, defaults, inability to access debt markets due to rating, banking, or
legal constraints, liquidity crises, the breakup or restructuring of fiscal, monetary, or political
systems such as the European Union, and other events or conditions that impair the functioning of
financial markets and institutions also pose risks to ExxonMobil, including risks to the safety of
our financial assets and to the ability of our partners and customers to fulfill their commitments to
ExxonMobil. Our future business results, including cash flows and financing needs, may also be
affected by the occurrence, severity, pace and rate of recovery of future public health epidemics or
pandemics; the responsive actions taken by governments and others; and the resulting effects on
regional and global markets and economies.
Other demand-related factors. Other factors that may affect the demand for oil, gas, petrochemicals
or our other products, and therefore impact our results, include technological improvements in energy
efficiency; seasonal weather patterns; increased competitiveness of, or government policy support
for, alternative energy sources; changes in technology that alter fuel choices, such as technological
advances in energy storage or other critical areas that make wind, solar, hydrogen, nuclear or other
alternatives more competitive for power generation; changes in consumer preferences for our products,
including consumer demand for alternative-fueled or electric transportation or alternatives to
plastic products; and broad-based changes in personal income levels. See also “Climate Change and the
Energy Transition” below.
 2 
Other supply-related factors. Commodity prices and margins also vary depending on a number of factors
affecting supply. For example, increased supply from the development of new oil and gas supply
sources and technologies to enhance recovery from existing sources tends to reduce commodity prices
to the extent such supply increases are not offset by commensurate growth in demand. Similarly,
increases in industry refining or petrochemical manufacturing capacity relative to demand tend to
reduce margins on the affected products. World oil, gas, and petrochemical supply levels can also be
affected by factors that reduce available supplies, such as the level of and adherence by
participating countries to production quotas established by OPEC or "OPEC+" and other agreements
among sovereigns; government policies, including actions intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,
that restrict oil and gas production or increase associated costs; the occurrence of wars or hostile
actions, including disruption of land or sea transportation routes; natural disasters; disruptions in
competitors’ operations; and logistics constraints or unexpected unavailability of distribution
channels that may disrupt supplies. Technological change can also alter the relative costs for
competitors to find, produce and refine oil and gas, and to manufacture petrochemicals.
Other market factors. ExxonMobil’s business results are also exposed to potential negative impacts
due to changes in interest rates, inflation, currency exchange rates, changes in usage of the U.S.
dollar in global trade, and other local or regional market conditions. In addition to direct
potential impacts on our costs and revenues, market factors such as rates of inflation may indirectly
impact our results to the extent such factors reduce general rates of economic growth and therefore
energy demand, as discussed under “Economic conditions”. Market factors may also result in losses
from commodity derivatives and other instruments we use to hedge price exposures or for trading
purposes. Additional information regarding the potential future impact of market factors on our
businesses is included or incorporated by reference under "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures About Market Risk" in this report.
 Government and Political Factors 
ExxonMobil’s results can be adversely affected by political or regulatory developments affecting our
operations.
Access limitations. A number of countries limit access to their oil and gas resources, including by
restricting leasing or permitting activities, or may place resources off-limits from development
altogether. Restrictions on production of oil and gas could increase to the extent governments view
such measures as a viable approach for pursuing national and global energy and climate policies.
Restrictions on foreign investment in the oil and gas sector tend to increase in times of high
commodity prices or when national governments may have less need for outside sources of private
capital. Many countries also restrict the import or export of certain products based on point of
origin.
Restrictions on doing business. ExxonMobil is subject to laws and sanctions imposed by the United
States or by other jurisdictions where we do business that may prohibit ExxonMobil or its affiliates
from doing business in certain countries or restrict the kind of business that may be conducted,
including acquiring or divesting certain assets. Such restrictions may provide a competitive
advantage to competitors who may not be subject to comparable restrictions.
Lack of legal certainty. Some countries in which we do business lack well-developed legal systems,
have not yet adopted or may be unable to maintain clear regulatory frameworks, or may have evolving
and unharmonized standards that vary or conflict across jurisdictions. Lack of legal certainty
exposes us to increased risk of adverse or unpredictable actions by government officials, and also
makes it more difficult for us to enforce our contracts. In some cases, these risks can be partially
offset by agreements to arbitrate disputes in an international forum, but the adequacy of this remedy
may still depend on the local legal system to enforce an award.
 3 
Regulatory and litigation risks. Even in countries with well-developed legal systems where ExxonMobil
does business, we remain exposed to changes in law or interpretation of settled law (including
changes that result from international treaties and accords) and changes in policy that could
adversely affect our results, such as:
• increases in taxes, duties, or government royalty rates (including retroactive claims or punitive
taxes on oil, gas and petrochemical operations);
• price controls;
• changes in environmental regulations or other laws that increase our cost of operation or
compliance or reduce or delay available business opportunities (including changes in laws affecting
offshore drilling operations, standards to complete decommissioning, water use, emissions, hydraulic
fracturing, or production or use of new or recycled plastics, as well as laws and regulations
affecting trading);
• actions by policy-makers, regulators, or other actors to delay or deny necessary licenses and
permits, restrict the availability of oil and gas leases or the transportation or export of our
products, or otherwise require changes in the company's business or strategy that could result in
reduced returns;
• regulatory interpretations that exclude or disfavor our products under government policies or
programs intended to support new or developing markets or technologies, or that otherwise are not
technology-neutral;
• adoption of regulations mandating efficiency standards, the use of alternative fuels or
uncompetitive fuel components;
• adoption of disclosure regulations that could create competitive disadvantages, require us to incur
disproportionate costs, or increase legal risk due to a need to rely on uncertain estimates or
extrapolations (such as emissions of third parties) and lack of uniform standards across
jurisdictions, or by requiring us to disclose competitively sensitive commercial information or to
violate the non-disclosure laws of other countries; and
• government actions to cancel contracts, redenominate the official currency, renounce or default on
obligations, renegotiate terms unilaterally, or expropriate assets.
Legal remedies available to compensate us for expropriation or other takings may be inadequate.
We also may be adversely affected by the outcome of litigation, especially in countries such as the
United States in which very large and unpredictable punitive damage awards may occur; by government
enforcement proceedings alleging non-compliance with applicable laws or regulations; or by state and
local government actors as well as private plaintiffs acting in parallel that attempt to use the
legal system to promote public policy agendas (including seeking to reduce the production and sale of
hydrocarbon products through litigation targeting the company or other industry participants), gain
political notoriety, or obtain monetary awards from the company. The continued adoption of similar
legal practices in the European Union or elsewhere would broaden this risk and has begun to be
applied to some of our competitors in the European Union.
Security concerns. Successful operation of particular facilities or projects may be disrupted by
civil unrest, acts of sabotage or terrorism, cybersecurity attacks, the application of national
security laws or policies that result in restricting our ability to do business in a particular
jurisdiction, and other local security concerns. Such concerns may be directed specifically at our
company, our industry, or as part of broader movements and may require us to incur greater costs for
security or to shut down operations for a period of time.
 Climate Change and the Energy Transition 
Net-zero scenarios. Driven by concern over the risks of climate change, a number of countries have
adopted, or are considering the adoption of, regulatory frameworks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
including emissions from the production and use of oil and gas and their products as well as the use
or support for different emission-reduction technologies. These actions are being taken both
independently by national and regional governments and within the framework of United Nations
Conference of the Parties summits under which many countries of the world have endorsed objectives to
reduce the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) over the coming decades, with an
ambition ultimately to achieve “net zero”. Net zero means that emissions of greenhouse gases from
human activities would be balanced by actions that remove such gases from the atmosphere.
Expectations for transition of the world’s energy system to lower-emission sources, and ultimately
net-zero, derive from hypothetical scenarios that reflect many assumptions about the future and
reflect substantial uncertainties. The company’s objective to play a leading role in the energy
transition, including the company’s announced ambition ultimately to achieve net zero with respect to
Scope 1 and 2 emissions from operations with continued technology development and policy support
where ExxonMobil is the operator, carries risks that the transition, including underlying
technologies, policies, and markets as discussed in more detail below, will not be available or
develop at the pace or in the manner expected by current net-zero scenarios. The success of our
strategy for the energy transition will also depend on our ability to recognize key signposts of
changes in the global energy system on a timely basis, and our corresponding ability to direct
investment to the technologies and businesses, at the appropriate stage of development, to best
capitalize on our competitive strengths.
 4 
Greenhouse gas restrictions. Government actions intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions include
adoption of cap and trade regimes, carbon taxes, carbon-based import duties or other trade tariffs,
minimum renewable usage requirements, restrictive permitting, increased mileage and other efficiency
standards, mandates for sales of electric vehicles, mandates for use of specific fuels or
technologies, and other incentives or mandates designed to support certain technologies for
transitioning to lower-emission energy sources. Political and other actors and their agents also
increasingly seek to advance climate change objectives indirectly, such as by seeking to reduce the
availability or increase the cost of financing and investment in the oil and gas sector. These
actions include delaying or blocking needed infrastructure, utilizing shareholder governance
mechanisms against companies or their shareholders or financial institutions in an effort to deter
investment in oil and gas activities, and taking other actions intended to promote changes in
business strategy for oil and gas companies. Depending on how policies are formulated and applied,
such policies could negatively affect our investment returns, make our hydrocarbon-based products
more expensive or less competitive, lengthen project implementation times, and reduce demand for
hydrocarbons, as well as shift hydrocarbon demand toward relatively lower-carbon alternatives.
Current and pending greenhouse gas regulations or policies may also increase our compliance costs,
such as for monitoring or sequestering emissions.
Technology and lower-emission solutions. Achieving societal ambitions to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions and ultimately achieve net zero will require new technologies to reduce the cost and
increase the scalability of alternative energy sources, as well as technologies such as carbon
capture and storage (CCS). CCS technologies, focused initially on capturing and sequestering CO2
emissions from high-intensity industrial activities, can assist in meeting society’s objective to
mitigate atmospheric greenhouse gas levels while also helping ensure the availability of the reliable
and affordable energy the world requires. ExxonMobil has established a Low Carbon Solutions (LCS)
business unit to advance the development and deployment of these technologies and projects, including
CCS, hydrogen, lower-emission fuels, and lithium, breakthrough energy efficiency processes, advanced
energy-saving materials, and other technologies. The company’s efforts include both in-house research
and development as well as collaborative efforts with leading universities and with commercial
partners involved in advanced lower-emission energy technologies. Our future results and ability to
grow our LCS business, help nations meet their emission-reduction goals, and succeed through the
energy transition will depend in part on the success of these research and collaboration efforts and
on our ability to adapt and apply the strengths of our current business model to providing the energy
products of the future in a cost-competitive manner.
Policy and market development. The scale of the world’s energy system means that, in addition to
developments in technology as discussed above, a successful energy transition will require
appropriate support from governments and private participants throughout the global economy. Our
ability to develop and deploy CCS and other lower-emission energy technologies at commercial scale,
and the growth and future returns of LCS and other emerging businesses in which we invest, will
depend in part on the continued development of supportive government policies and markets. Failure or
delay of these policies or markets to materialize or be maintained could adversely impact these
investments. Policy and other actions that result in restricting the availability of hydrocarbon
products without commensurate reduction in demand may have unpredictable adverse effects, including
increased commodity price volatility; periods of significantly higher commodity prices and resulting
inflationary pressures; and local or regional energy shortages. Such effects in turn may depress
economic growth or lead to rapid or conflicting shifts in policy by different actors, with resulting
adverse effects on our businesses. In addition, the existence of supportive policies in any
jurisdiction is not a guarantee that those policies will continue in the future. See also the
discussion of “Supply and Demand,” “Government and Political Factors,” and “Operational and Other
Factors” in this Item 1A.
 Operational and Other Factors 
In addition to external economic and political factors, our future business results also depend on
our ability to manage successfully those factors that are, at least in part, within our control,
including our capital allocation into existing and new businesses. The extent to which we manage
these factors will impact our performance relative to competition. For projects in which we are not
the operator, we depend on the management effectiveness of one or more co-venturers whom we do not
control.
Exploration and development program. Our ability to maintain and grow our oil and gas production
depends on the success of our exploration and development efforts. Among other factors, we must
continuously improve our ability to identify the most promising resource prospects and apply our
project management expertise to bring discovered resources online as scheduled and within budget.
 5 
Project and portfolio management. The long-term success of ExxonMobil’s Upstream and Product
Solutions businesses, as well as the future success of LCS and other emerging lower-emission
investments, depends on complex, long-term, capital-intensive projects. These projects in turn
require a high degree of project management expertise to maximize efficiency. Specific factors that
can affect the performance of major projects include our ability to: negotiate successfully with
joint venturers, partners, governments, suppliers, customers, or others; model and optimize reservoir
performance; develop markets for project outputs, whether through long-term contracts or the
development of effective spot markets; qualify for certain incentives available under supportive
government policies for emerging markets and technologies; manage changes in operating conditions and
costs, including costs of third party equipment or services such as drilling rigs and shipping,
supply-chain disruptions, and inflationary cost pressures; prevent, to the extent possible, and
respond effectively to unforeseen technical difficulties that could delay project start-up or cause
unscheduled project downtime; and influence the performance of project operators where ExxonMobil
does not perform that role. In addition to the effective management of individual projects,
ExxonMobil’s success, including our ability to mitigate risk and provide attractive returns to
shareholders, depends on our ability to successfully manage our overall portfolio, including
diversification among types and locations of our projects, products produced, and strategies to
acquire or divest assets. We may not be able to divest assets at a price or on the timeline we
contemplate in our strategies. Additionally, we may retain certain liabilities following a divestment
and could be held liable for past use or for different liabilities than anticipated.
The term “project” as used in this report can refer to a variety of different activities and does not
necessarily have the same meaning as in any government payment transparency reports.
Operational efficiency. An important component of ExxonMobil’s competitive performance, especially
given the commodity-based nature of many of our businesses, is our ability to operate efficiently,
including our ability to manage expenses, improve production yields on an ongoing basis and
successfully integrate and achieve the anticipated synergies of acquisitions, including the
acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources Company. This requires continuous management focus,
including technology integration and improvements, cost control, productivity enhancements,
harmonizing the functions, policies, procedures and processes, regular reappraisal of our asset
portfolio, and the recruitment, development, and retention of high caliber employees.
Research and development and technological change. To maintain our competitive position, especially
in light of the technological nature of our businesses and the need for continuous efficiency
improvement, ExxonMobil’s technology, research, and development organizations must be successful and
able to adapt to a changing market and policy environment, including continuous improvement in the
efficiency of hydraulic fracturing technology and developing technologies to help reduce greenhouse
gas emissions. To remain competitive, we must also continuously adapt and capture the benefits of new
and emerging technologies, including successfully applying advances in the ability to process very
large amounts of data to our businesses.
Safety, business controls, and environmental risk management. Our results depend on management’s
ability to minimize the inherent risks of oil, gas, and petrochemical operations, to effectively
control our business activities, including trading, and to minimize the potential for human error. We
apply rigorous management systems and continuous focus on workplace safety and avoiding spills or
other adverse environmental events. For example, we work to minimize spills through a combined
program of effective operations integrity management, ongoing upgrades, key equipment replacements,
and comprehensive inspection and surveillance. Similarly, we are implementing cost-effective new
technologies and adopting new operating practices to reduce emissions, not only in response to
government requirements but also to address community priorities. We employ a robust and actively
evolving enterprise risk management system to identify and manage risk across our businesses. We also
maintain a disciplined framework of internal controls and apply a controls management system for
monitoring compliance with this framework. Substantial liabilities and other adverse impacts could
result if we do not timely identify and mitigate applicable risks, or if our management systems and
controls do not function as intended.
Cybersecurity. ExxonMobil is regularly subject to attempted cybersecurity disruptions from a variety
of sources including state-sponsored actors. See Item 1C in this Report for information on
ExxonMobil’s program for managing cybersecurity risks. If the measures we are taking to protect
against cybersecurity disruptions prove to be insufficient or if our proprietary data is otherwise
not protected, ExxonMobil, as well as our customers, employees, or third parties, could be adversely
affected. We have limited ability to influence third parties, including our partners, suppliers and
service providers (including providers of cloud-hosting services for our data or applications), to
implement strong cybersecurity controls and are exposed to potential harm from cybersecurity events
that may affect their operations. Cybersecurity disruptions could cause physical harm to people or
the environment; damage or destroy assets; compromise business systems; result in proprietary
information being altered, lost, or stolen; result in employee, customer, or third-party information
being compromised; or otherwise disrupt our business operations. We could incur significant costs to
remedy the effects of a major cybersecurity disruption in addition to costs in connection with
resulting regulatory actions, litigation, or reputational harm.
 6 
Preparedness. Our operations may be disrupted by severe weather events, natural disasters, human
error, and similar events. For example, hurricanes may damage our offshore production facilities or
coastal refining and petrochemical plants in vulnerable areas. Our facilities are designed,
engineered, constructed, and operated to withstand a variety of extreme climatic and other
conditions, with safety factors built in to cover a number of uncertainties, including those
associated with wave, wind, and current intensity, marine ice flow patterns, permafrost stability,
storm surge magnitude, temperature extremes, extreme rainfall events, and earthquakes. Our
consideration of changing weather conditions and inclusion of safety factors in design covers the
engineering uncertainties that climate change and other events may potentially introduce. Our ability
to mitigate the adverse impacts of these events depends in part upon the effectiveness of our robust
facility engineering, our rigorous disaster preparedness and response, and business continuity
planning.
Insurance limitations. The ability of the Corporation to insure against many of the risks it faces as
described in this Item 1A is limited by the availability and cost of coverage, which may not be
economic, as well as the capacity of the applicable insurance markets, which may not be sufficient.
Competition. As noted in Item 1 above, the energy and petrochemical industries are highly
competitive. We face competition not only from other private firms, but also from state-owned
companies that are increasingly competing for opportunities outside of their home countries and as
partners with other private firms. In some cases, these state-owned companies may pursue
opportunities in furtherance of strategic objectives of their government owners, with less focus on
financial returns than companies owned by private shareholders, such as ExxonMobil. Technology and
expertise provided by industry service companies may also enhance the competitiveness of firms that
may not have the internal resources and capabilities of ExxonMobil or reduce the need for resource-
owning countries to partner with private-sector oil and gas companies in order to monetize national
resources. As described in more detail above, our hydrocarbon-based energy products are also subject
to growing and, in many cases, government-supported competition from alternative energy sources.
Reputation. Our reputation is an important corporate asset. Factors that could have a negative impact
on our reputation include an operating incident or significant cybersecurity disruption; changes in
consumer views concerning our products; a perception by investors or others that the Corporation is
making insufficient progress with respect to our ambition to play a leading role in the energy
transition, or that pursuit of this ambition may result in allocation of capital to investments with
reduced returns; and other adverse events such as those described in this Item 1A. Negative impacts
on our reputation could in turn make it more difficult for us to compete successfully for new
opportunities, obtain necessary regulatory approvals, obtain financing, and attract talent, or they
could reduce consumer demand for our branded products. ExxonMobil’s reputation may also be harmed by
events which negatively affect the image of our industry as a whole.
Projections, estimates, and descriptions of ExxonMobil’s plans and objectives included or
incorporated in Items 1, 1A, 1C, 2, 5, 7, and 7A of this report are forward-looking statements.
Actual future results, including project completion dates, production rates, capital expenditures,
costs, and business plans could differ materially due to, among other things, the factors discussed
above and elsewhere in this report.
 ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

 ITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY 
The Corporation recognizes the importance of cybersecurity in achieving its business objectives,
safeguarding its assets, and managing its daily operations. Accordingly, the Corporation integrates
cybersecurity risks into its overall enterprise risk management system. The Audit Committee oversees
the Corporation’s risk management approach and structure, which includes an annual review of the
Corporation’s cybersecurity program.
The Corporation’s cybersecurity program is managed by the Corporation’s Vice President of IT, with
support from cross-functional teams led by ExxonMobil information technology (IT) and operational
technology (OT) cybersecurity operations managers (collectively, Cybersecurity Operations Managers).
The Cybersecurity Operations Managers are responsible for the day-to-day management and effective
functioning of the cybersecurity program, including the prevention, detection, investigation, and
response to cybersecurity threats and incidents. The Cybersecurity Operations Managers collectively
have many years of experience in cybersecurity operations.
IT management provides regular reports to the Corporation’s senior management throughout the year,
and to the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors, as appropriate, in its annual cybersecurity
review. Such reports typically address, among other things, the Corporation’s cybersecurity strategy,
initiatives, key security metrics, penetration testing and benchmarking learnings, and business
response plans as well as the evolving cybersecurity threat landscape.
The Corporation’s cybersecurity program includes multi-layered technological capabilities designed to
prevent and detect cybersecurity disruptions and leverages industry standard frameworks, including
the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework. The cybersecurity program
incorporates an incident response plan to engage cross-functionally across the Corporation and report
cybersecurity incidents to appropriate levels of management, including senior management, and the
Audit Committee or Board of Directors, based on potential impact. The Corporation conducts annual
cybersecurity awareness training and routinely tests cybersecurity awareness and business
preparedness for response and recovery, which are developed based on real-world threats. In addition,
the Corporation exchanges threat information with governmental and industry groups and proactively
engages independent, third-party cybersecurity experts to test, evaluate and recommend improvements
on the effectiveness and resiliency of its cybersecurity program through penetration testing, breach
assessments, regular cybersecurity incident drill testing, threat information sharing, and industry
benchmarking. The Corporation takes a risk-based approach with respect to its third-party service
providers, tailoring processes according to the nature and sensitivity of the data or systems
accessed by such third-party service providers and performing additional risk screenings and
procedures, as appropriate.
As of the date of this report, we have not identified any risks from known cybersecurity threats,
including as a result of any prior cybersecurity incidents, that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect the Corporation, including our business strategy, results of
operations, or financial condition.
While the Corporation believes its cybersecurity program to be appropriate for managing constantly
evolving cybersecurity risks, no program can fully protect against all possible adverse events. For
additional information on these risks and potential consequences if the measures we are taking prove
to be insufficient or if our proprietary data is otherwise not protected, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors:
Operational and Other Factors -- Cybersecurity” in this report.

In the preceding reserves information, consolidated subsidiary and equity company reserves are
reported separately. However, the Corporation operates its business with the same view of equity
company reserves as it has for reserves from consolidated subsidiaries.
The Corporation anticipates several projects will come online over the next few years providing
additional production capacity. However, actual volumes will vary from year to year due to the timing
of individual project start-ups; operational outages; reservoir performance; regulatory changes; the
impact of fiscal and commercial terms; asset sales; weather events; price effects on production
sharing contracts; changes in the amount and timing of capital investments that may vary depending on
the oil and gas price environment; international trade patterns and relations; and other factors
described in "Item 1A. Risk Factors".
The estimation of proved reserves, which is based on the requirement of reasonable certainty, is an
ongoing process based on rigorous technical evaluations, commercial and market assessments and
detailed analysis of well and reservoir information such as flow rates and reservoir pressures.
Furthermore, the Corporation only records proved reserves for projects which have received
significant funding commitments by management toward the development of the reserves. Although the
Corporation is reasonably certain that proved reserves will be produced, the timing and amount
recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects,
reservoir performance, regulatory approvals, government policies, consumer preferences, and
significant changes in crude oil and natural gas price levels. In addition, proved reserves could be
affected by an extended period of low prices which could reduce the level of the Corporation’s
capital spending and also impact our partners’ capacity to fund their share of joint projects.
B. Technologies Used in Establishing Proved Reserves Additions in 2023
Additions to ExxonMobil’s proved reserves in 2023 were based on estimates generated through the
integration of available and appropriate geological, engineering and production data, utilizing well-
established technologies that have been demonstrated in the field to yield repeatable and consistent
results.
Data used in these integrated assessments included information obtained directly from the subsurface
via wellbores, such as well logs, reservoir core samples, fluid samples, static and dynamic pressure
information, production test data, and surveillance and performance information. The data utilized
also included subsurface information obtained through indirect measurements including high-quality
3‑D and 4‑D seismic data, calibrated with available well control information. The tools used to
interpret the data included seismic processing software, reservoir modeling and simulation software,
and data analysis packages.
In some circumstances, where appropriate analog reservoirs were available, reservoir parameters from
these analogs were used to increase the quality of and confidence in the reserves estimates.
C. Qualifications of Reserves Technical Oversight Group and Internal Controls over Proved Reserves
ExxonMobil has a dedicated Global Reserves and Resources group that provides technical oversight and
is separate from the operating organization. Primary responsibilities of this group include oversight
of the reserves estimation process for compliance with Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules
and regulations, review of annual changes in reserves estimates, and the reporting of ExxonMobil’s
proved reserves. This group also maintains the official company reserves estimates for ExxonMobil’s
proved reserves of crude oil, natural gas liquids, bitumen, synthetic oil, and natural gas. In
addition, the group provides training to personnel involved in the reserves estimation and reporting
process within ExxonMobil and its affiliates. The current Global Reserves and Resources Manager has
more than 30 years of experience in reservoir engineering and reserves assessment, has a degree in
Engineering, and served on the Oil and Gas Reserves Committee of the Society of Petroleum Engineers.
The group is staffed with individuals that have an average of more than 15 years of technical
experience in the petroleum industry, including expertise in the classification and categorization of
reserves under SEC guidelines. This group includes individuals who hold degrees in either Engineering
or Geology.
The Global Reserves and Resources group maintains a central database containing the official company
reserves estimates. Appropriate controls, including limitations on database access and update
capabilities, are in place to ensure data integrity within this central database. An annual review of
the system’s controls is performed by internal audit. Key components of the reserves estimation
process include technical evaluations, commercial and market assessments, analysis of well and field
performance, and long-standing approval guidelines. No changes may be made to the reserves estimates
in the central database, including additions of any new initial reserves estimates or subsequent
revisions, unless these changes have been thoroughly reviewed and evaluated by duly authorized
geoscience and engineering professionals within the operating organization. In addition, changes to
reserves estimates that exceed certain thresholds require further review and approval by the
appropriate level of management within the operating organization before the changes may be made in
the central database. Endorsement by the Global Reserves and Resources group for all proved reserves
changes is a mandatory component of this review process. After all changes are made, reviews are held
with senior management for final endorsement.

 2. Proved Undeveloped Reserves 
At year-end 2023, approximately 6.3 billion oil-equivalent barrels (GOEB) of ExxonMobil’s proved
reserves were classified as proved undeveloped. This represents 37 percent of the 16.9 GOEB reported
in proved reserves. This compares to 6.6 GOEB of proved undeveloped reserves reported at the end of
2022. During the year, ExxonMobil conducted development activities that resulted in the transfer of
approximately 0.8 GOEB from proved undeveloped to proved developed reserves by year-end. The largest
transfers were related to development activities in the United States, Guyana, Australia, and the
United Arab Emirates. In 2023, extensions and discoveries, primarily in the United States and Guyana,
resulted in the addition of approximately 1.1 GOEB of proved undeveloped reserves. Also, the
Corporation reclassified approximately 0.6 GOEB of proved undeveloped reserves which no longer met
the SEC definition of proved reserves, primarily in the United States.
Overall, investments of $14.6 billion were made by the Corporation during 2023 to progress the
development of reported proved undeveloped reserves, including $14.3 billion for oil and gas
producing activities, along with additional investments for other non-oil and gas producing
activities such as the construction of support infrastructure and other related facilities. These
investments represented 74 percent of the $19.8 billion in total reported Upstream capital and
exploration expenditures.
One of ExxonMobil’s requirements for reporting proved reserves is that management has made
significant funding commitments toward the development of the reserves. ExxonMobil has a disciplined
investment strategy and many major fields require long lead-time in order to be developed.
Development projects typically take several years from the time of recording proved undeveloped
reserves to the start of production and can exceed five years for large and complex projects. Proved
undeveloped reserves in Australia, Kazakhstan, the United Arab Emirates, and the United States have
remained undeveloped for five years or more primarily due to constraints on the capacity of
infrastructure, as well as the time required to complete development for very large projects. The
Corporation is reasonably certain that these proved reserves will be produced; however, the timing
and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development
projects, reservoir performance, regulatory approvals, government policies, consumer preferences, the
pace of co-venturer/government funding, changes in the amount and timing of capital investments, and
significant changes in crude oil and natural gas price levels. Of the proved undeveloped reserves
that have been reported for five or more years, over 80 percent are contained in the aforementioned
countries. In Australia, proved undeveloped reserves are associated with future compression for the
Gorgon Jansz LNG project. In Kazakhstan, the proved undeveloped reserves are related to the remainder
of the Tengizchevroil joint venture development that includes a production license in the Tengiz -
Korolev field complex. The Tengizchevroil joint venture is producing, and proved undeveloped reserves
will continue to move to proved developed as approved development phases progress. In the United Arab
Emirates, proved undeveloped reserves are associated with an approved development plan and continued
drilling investment for the producing Upper Zakum field.

Average production prices have been calculated by using sales quantities from the Corporation’s own
production as the divisor. Average production costs have been computed by using net production
quantities for the divisor. The volumes of crude oil and natural gas liquids (NGL) production used
for this computation are shown in the oil and gas production table in section 3.A. The volumes of
natural gas used in the calculation are the production volumes of natural gas available for sale and
are also shown in section 3.A. The natural gas available for sale volumes are different from those
shown in the reserves table in the “Oil and Gas Reserves” part of the “Supplemental Information on
Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Activities” portion of the Financial Section of this report
due to volumes consumed or flared. Natural gas is converted to an oil-equivalent basis at six million
cubic feet per one thousand barrels.

B. Exploratory and Development Activities Regarding Oil and Gas Resources Extracted by Mining
Technologies
Syncrude Operations. Syncrude is a joint venture established to recover shallow deposits of oil sands
using open-pit mining methods to extract the crude bitumen, and then upgrade it to produce a high-
quality, light (32 degrees API), sweet, synthetic crude oil. Imperial Oil Limited is the owner of a
25 percent interest in the joint venture. Exxon Mobil Corporation has a 69.6 percent interest in
Imperial Oil Limited. In 2023, the company’s share of net production of synthetic crude oil was about
67 thousand barrels per day and share of net acreage was about 55 thousand acres in the Athabasca oil
sands deposit.
Kearl Operations. Kearl is a joint venture established to recover shallow deposits of oil sands using
open-pit mining methods to extract the crude bitumen. Imperial Oil Limited holds a 70.96 percent
interest in the joint venture and ExxonMobil Canada Properties holds the other 29.04 percent. Exxon
Mobil Corporation has a 69.6 percent interest in Imperial Oil Limited and a 100 percent interest in
ExxonMobil Canada Properties. Kearl is comprised of six oil sands leases covering about 49 thousand
acres in the Athabasca oil sands deposit.
Kearl is located approximately 40 miles north of Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada. Bitumen is extracted
from oil sands and processed through bitumen extraction and froth treatment trains. The product, a
blend of bitumen and diluent, is shipped to our refineries and to other third parties. Diluent is
natural gas condensate or other light hydrocarbons added to the crude bitumen to facilitate
transportation by pipeline and rail. During 2023, average net production at Kearl was about 249
thousand barrels per day.

contractual obligations, some of which may specify the delivery of a fixed and determinable quantity
for periods longer than one year. ExxonMobil also enters into natural gas sales contracts where the
source of the natural gas used to fulfill the contract can be a combination of our own production and
the spot market. Worldwide, we are contractually committed to deliver approximately 78 million
barrels of oil and 2.5 trillion cubic feet of natural gas for the period from 2024 through 2026. We
expect to fulfill the majority of these delivery commitments with production from our proved
developed reserves. Any remaining commitments will be fulfilled with production from our proved
undeveloped reserves and purchases on the open market as necessary.

ExxonMobil’s investment in developed and undeveloped acreage is comprised of numerous concessions,
blocks, and leases. The terms and conditions under which the Corporation maintains exploration and/or
production rights to the acreage are property-specific, contractually defined, and vary significantly
from property to property. Work programs are designed to ensure that the exploration potential of any
property is fully evaluated before expiration. In some instances, the Corporation may elect to
relinquish acreage in advance of the contractual expiration date if the evaluation process is
complete and there is not a business basis for extension. In cases where additional time may be
required to fully evaluate acreage, the Corporation has generally been successful in obtaining
extensions. The scheduled expiration of leases and concessions for undeveloped acreage over the next
three years is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the Corporation.
 22 
 D. Summary of Acreage Terms 
 United States 
Oil and gas exploration and production rights are acquired from mineral interest owners through a
lease. Mineral interest owners include the Federal and State governments, as well as private mineral
interest owners. Leases typically have a primary term ranging from one to 10 years, and a production
period beyond the primary term that normally remains in effect until production ceases. Under certain
circumstances, a lease may be held beyond its primary term even if production has not commenced. In
some instances regarding private property, a “fee interest” is acquired where the underlying mineral
interests are owned outright.
 Canada / Other Americas 
Canada
Exploration licenses or leases in onshore areas are acquired for varying periods of time with
renewals or extensions possible. These licenses or leases entitle the holder to continue existing
licenses or leases upon completing specified work. In general, these license and lease agreements are
held as long as there is proven production capability on the licenses and leases. Offshore
exploration licenses are generally held by work commitments of various amounts and rentals. Offshore
production licenses are valid for 25 years, with rights of extension for continued production.
Significant discovery licenses in the offshore relating to currently undeveloped discoveries do not
have a definite term.
Argentina
The Federal Hydrocarbon Law was amended in 2014. Pursuant to the amended law, the production term for
an onshore unconventional concession is 35 years and 25 years for a conventional concession, with
unlimited 10-year extensions possible once a field has been developed. In 2019, the government
granted three offshore exploration licenses, with terms of eight years, divided into two exploration
periods of four years, with an optional extension of five years for each license.
Brazil
The exploration and production of oil and gas are governed by concession contracts and production
sharing contracts (PSCs). Concession contracts provide for an exploration period of up to eight years
and a production period of 27 years. PSCs provide for an exploration period of up to seven years and
a production period of up to 28 years.
Guyana
The Petroleum Activities Act 2023 authorizes the Government of Guyana to license and enter petroleum
agreements for petroleum exploration, development, production, and storage operations. The Act
enables petroleum agreements to provide for an exploration period to be established by subsidiary
legislation by the Minister (typically up to 10 years) and provide for a production period of 20
years for an oil field and 30 years for a gas field, each with a renewal period of up to 10 years.
 Europe 
Germany
Exploration concessions are granted for an initial maximum period of five years, with an unlimited
number of extensions up to three years each. Extensions are subject to specific minimum work
commitments. Production licenses were historically granted for 20 to 25 years with multiple possible
extensions subject to production on the license.
Netherlands
Under the Mining Law, effective January 1, 2003, exploration and production licenses for both onshore
and offshore areas are issued for a period as explicitly defined in the license. The term is based on
the period of time necessary to perform the activities for which the license is issued. License
conditions are stipulated in the license and are based on the Mining Law.
Production rights granted prior to January 1, 2003, remain subject to their existing terms and differ
slightly for onshore and offshore areas. Onshore production licenses issued prior to 1988 were
indefinite; from 1988 they were issued for a period as explicitly defined in the license, ranging
from 35 to 45 years. Offshore production licenses issued before 1976 were issued for a fixed period
of 40 years; from 1976 they were again issued for a period as explicitly defined in the license,
ranging from 15 to 40 years.
 23 
United Kingdom
Acreage terms are fixed by the government and are periodically changed. For example, many of the
early licenses issued under the first four licensing rounds provided an initial term of six years
with relinquishment of at least one-half of the original area at the end of the initial term, subject
to extension for a further 40 years. At the end of any such 40-year term, licenses may continue in
producing areas until cessation of production; or licenses may continue in development areas for
periods agreed on a case-by-case basis until they become producing areas; or licenses terminate in
all other areas. The majority of traditional licenses currently issued have an initial exploration
term of four years with a second term extension of four years, and a final production term of 18
years, with a mandatory relinquishment of 50 percent of the acreage after the initial term and of all
acreage that is not covered by a development plan at the end of the second term.
 Africa 
Angola
Exploration and production activities are governed by either production sharing agreements or other
contracts with initial exploration terms ranging from three to four years with options to extend from
one to five years. The production periods range from 20 to 30 years, and the agreements generally
provide for negotiated extensions.
Equatorial Guinea
Exploration, development and production activities are governed by production sharing contracts
negotiated with the State Ministry of Mines and Hydrocarbons. The production period for crude oil is
30 years. ExxonMobil is actively taking steps to exit its operations in the country.
Mozambique
Exploration and production activities are generally governed by concession contracts with the
Government of the Republic of Mozambique, represented by the Ministry of Mineral Resources and
Energy. An interest in Area 4 offshore Mozambique was acquired in 2017. Terms for Area 4 are governed
by the Exploration and Production Concession Contract (EPCC) for Area 4 Offshore of the Rovuma Block.
The EPCC expires 30 years after an approved plan of development becomes effective for a given
discovery area.
In 2018, an interest was acquired in Area 5 offshore blocks A5-B, Z5-C, and Z5-D. Blocks Z5-C and
Z5-D were relinquished in 2022. In 2023, the initial exploration phase expired on block A5-B,
resulting in a relinquishment of the remaining Area 5 acreage.
Nigeria
Exploration and production activities in the deepwater offshore areas are governed by production
sharing contracts (PSCs) with the national oil company, the Nigerian National Petroleum Company
Limited (NNPCL). NNPCL typically holds the underlying license or lease. The terms of the PSCs are
generally 30 years (comprised of a 10-year exploration period and a 20-year production period).
Exploration and production activities in the shallow-water offshore areas are governed by Oil Mining
Leases granted prior to the 1969 Petroleum Act (i.e., under the Mineral Oils Act 1914, repealed by
the 1969 Petroleum Act) and have been renewed in 2011 for a further period of 20 years. Operations
under these pre-1969 Oil Mining Leases are conducted under a joint venture agreement with NNPCL
rather than a PSC. Commercial terms applicable to the existing joint venture oil production are
defined by the Petroleum Profits Tax Act.
The 2021 Petroleum Industry Act will govern any further renewals to the term of the PSCs, licenses,
or leases.
 Asia 
Azerbaijan
The production sharing agreement (PSA) for the development of the Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli field was
established for an initial period of 30 years starting from the PSA execution date in 1994. The PSA
was amended in September 2017 to extend the term by 25 years to 2049.
Indonesia
Exploration and production activities in Indonesia are generally governed by cooperation contracts,
usually in the form of a production sharing contract (PSC). The current PSCs have an exploration
period of six years, which can be extended once for a period of four years with a total contract
period of 30 years including an exploitation period. PSC terms can be extended for a maximum of 20
years for each extension with the approval of the government.
 24 
Iraq
Development and production activities in the state-owned oil and gas fields are governed by contracts
with regional oil companies of the Iraqi Ministry of Oil. An ExxonMobil affiliate entered into a
contract with Basra Oil Company of the Iraqi Ministry of Oil for the rights to participate in the
development and production activities of the West Qurna Phase I oil and gas field effective March 1,
2010. The term of the contract is 20 years with the right to extend for a period of five to 15 years.
The contract provides for cost recovery plus per-barrel fees for incremental production above
specified levels. In early 2024, ExxonMobil closed on the sale of its remaining interest resulting in
a full exit from the country.
Kazakhstan
Onshore exploration and production activities are governed by the production license, exploration
license, and joint venture agreements negotiated with the Republic of Kazakhstan. Existing production
operations have a 40-year production period that commenced in 1993.
Offshore exploration and production activities are governed by a production sharing agreement
negotiated with the Republic of Kazakhstan. The exploration period is six years followed by separate
appraisal periods for each discovery. The production period for each discovery, which includes
development, is 20 years from the date of declaration of commerciality with the possibility of two
10-year extensions.
Malaysia
Production activities are governed by production sharing contracts (PSCs) negotiated with the
national oil company. The PSCs have production terms of 25 years. Extensions are generally subject to
the national oil company’s prior written approval.
Qatar
The State of Qatar grants gas production development project rights to develop and supply gas from
the offshore North Field to permit the economic development and production of gas reserves sufficient
to satisfy the gas and LNG sales obligations of these projects. The initial terms for these rights
generally extend for 25 years. Extensions and terms are subject to State of Qatar approval.
Thailand
The Petroleum Act of 1971 allows production under ExxonMobil’s concessions for 30 years with a
10-year extension at terms generally prevalent at the time.
United Arab Emirates
An interest in the development and production activities of the offshore Upper Zakum field was
acquired in 2006. In 2017, the governing agreements were extended to 2051.
 Australia / Oceania 
Australia
Exploration and production activities conducted offshore in Commonwealth waters are governed by
Federal legislation. Exploration permits are granted for an initial term of six years with two
possible five-year renewal periods. Retention leases may be granted for resources that are not
commercially viable at the time of application but are likely to become commercially viable within 15
years. These are granted for periods of five years, and renewals may be requested. Prior to July
1998, production licenses were granted initially for 21 years, with a further renewal of 21 years and
thereafter indefinitely, i.e., for the life of the field. Effective from July 1998, new production
licenses are granted indefinitely. In each case, a production license may be terminated if no
production operations have been carried on for five years.
Papua New Guinea
Exploration and production activities are governed by the Oil and Gas Act. Petroleum prospecting
licenses are granted for an initial term of six years with a five-year extension possible (an
additional extension of three years is possible in certain circumstances). Generally, a 50-percent
relinquishment of the license area is required at the end of the initial six-year term, if extended.
Petroleum development licenses are granted for an initial 25-year period. An extension for further
consecutive period(s) of up to 20 years may be granted at the Minister’s discretion. Petroleum
retention licenses may be granted for gas resources that are not commercially viable at the time of
application but may become commercially viable within the maximum possible retention time of 15
years. Petroleum retention licenses are granted for an initial five-year period, and may only be
extended, at the Minister’s discretion, twice for the maximum retention time of 15 years.

 ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
ExxonMobil has elected to use a $1 million threshold for disclosing environmental proceedings.
As reported in the Corporation’s Form 10-Q for the third quarter of 2023, the State of Texas filed
suit against ExxonMobil Oil Corporation (EMOC) on August 19, 2020, seeking penalties and injunctive
relief in connection with alleged unauthorized emissions events at EMOC’s Beaumont Refinery in Texas
from 2017 to 2020. The suit, captioned State of Texas v. ExxonMobil Oil Corporation, was filed in the
98th Judicial District Court of Travis County, Texas (the “98th Judicial District Court”). In
September 2023, the State of Texas and EMOC agreed to settle the alleged violations upon payment of
$1.6 million to the State of Texas (the “Settlement”) pending approval by the 98th Judicial District
Court. In November 2023, the 98th Judicial District Court approved the Settlement, and EMOC paid the
amounts required under the Settlement in December 2023.
