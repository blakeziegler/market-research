 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
 General 
Walmart Inc. ("Walmart," the "Company" or "we") helps people around the world save money and live
better – anytime and anywhere – by providing the opportunity to shop in retail stores and through
eCommerce. Through innovation, we strive to continuously improve a customer-centric experience that
seamlessly integrates our eCommerce and retail stores in an omni-channel offering that saves time for
our customers. Each week, we serve over 240 million customers who visit approximately 11,400 stores
and numerous eCommerce websites under 54 banners in 26 countries.
Our strategy is to make every day easier for busy families, operate with discipline, sharpen our
culture and become digital, and make trust a competitive advantage. Making life easier for busy
families includes our commitment to price leadership, which has been and will remain a cornerstone of
our business, as well as increasing convenience to save our customers time. By leading on price, we
earn the trust of our customers every day by providing a broad assortment of quality merchandise and
services at everyday low prices ("EDLP"). EDLP is our pricing philosophy under which we price items
at a low price every day so our customers trust that our prices will not change under frequent
promotional activity. Everyday low cost ("EDLC") is our commitment to control expenses so our cost
savings can be passed along to our customers.
Our operations comprise three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's
Club. Our fiscal year ends on January 31 for our United States ("U.S.") and Canadian operations. We
consolidate all other operations generally using a one-month lag and on a calendar year basis. Our
discussion is as of and for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021 ("fiscal 2021"), January 31, 2020
("fiscal 2020") and January 31, 2019 ("fiscal 2019"). During fiscal 2021, we generated total revenues
of $559.2 billion, which was primarily comprised of net sales of $555.2 billion.
We maintain our principal offices in Bentonville, Arkansas. Our common stock trades on the New York
Stock Exchange under the symbol "WMT."
 The Development of Our Company 
The businesses conducted by our founders began in 1945 when Sam M. Walton opened a franchise Ben
Franklin variety store in Newport, Arkansas. In 1946, his brother, James L. Walton, opened a similar
store in Versailles, Missouri. Until 1962, our founders' business was devoted entirely to the
operation of variety stores. In 1983, we opened our first Sam's Club, and in 1988, we opened our
first supercenter. In 1998, we opened our first Walmart Neighborhood Market. In 1991, we began our
first international initiative when we entered into a joint venture in Mexico and, as of January 31,
2021, our Walmart International segment conducted business in 25 countries.
In 2000, we began our first eCommerce initiative by creating both walmart.com and samsclub.com. Since
then, our eCommerce presence has continued to grow. In 2007, leveraging our physical stores,
walmart.com launched its Site to Store service, enabling customers to make a purchase online and pick
up merchandise in stores. To date, we now have approximately 7,300 pickup and 5,200 delivery
locations globally. In recent years, we have heavily invested in omni-channel and eCommerce
innovation, as well as made several eCommerce acquisitions to better serve our customers. These
investments have enabled us to leverage technology, talent and expertise, incubate digitally-native
brands, and expand our assortment and service offerings in stores and on walmart.com. We have also
continued to enhance our eCommerce initiatives internationally, such as with our acquisition of a
majority stake of Flipkart Private Limited ("Flipkart"), which is our ecosystem in India that
includes eCommerce platforms of Flipkart and Myntra as well as PhonePe, a digital transaction
platform.
In fiscal 2021, we launched Walmart+ in the U.S., a new membership offering with omni-channel
shopping benefits that currently include unlimited free shipping on eligible items with no order
minimum, unlimited delivery from store, fuel discounts, and mobile scan & go for a streamlined in-
store shopping experience. We are enhancing our ecosystem with our omni-channel capabilities, stores,
services, eCommerce sites and supply chain combined with our more than 2.3 million associates as of
January 31, 2021 to better serve our customers. Together, we believe these elements produce a
flywheel effect which creates customer relationships where customers view Walmart as their primary
destination.
During fiscal 2021, the world has been, and continues to be, impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. While
we have incurred incremental costs associated with operating during a global health crisis, the
COVID-19 pandemic has also accelerated our business growth and eCommerce expansion. We have continued
to invest in our omni-channel offering which resonates with customers around the world who are
increasingly seeking convenience.

 Information About Our Segments 
We are engaged in global operations of retail, wholesale and other units, as well as eCommerce,
located throughout the U.S., Africa, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India and Mexico. The
Company also engaged in operations in the U.K. and Japan, both of which were classified as held for
sale as of January 31, 2021. We also operated in Argentina and Brazil prior to the sale of Walmart
Argentina in November 2020 and the majority stake of Walmart Brazil in fiscal 2019. Refer to Note 12
to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information on these divestitures. Our operations are
conducted in three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club, which are
further described below. Each segment contributes to the Company's operating results differently.
However, each has generally maintained a consistent contribution rate to the Company's net sales and
operating income in recent years other than minor changes to the contribution rate for the Walmart
International segment due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Additional information on our
operating segments and geographic and product information is contained in Note 13 to our Consolidated
Financial Statements.
 Walmart U.S. Segment 
Walmart U.S. is our largest segment and operates in the U.S., including in all 50 states, Washington
D.C. and Puerto Rico. Walmart U.S. is a mass merchandiser of consumer products, operating under the
"Walmart" and "Walmart Neighborhood Market" brands, as well as walmart.com and other eCommerce
brands. Walmart U.S. had net sales of $370.0 billion for fiscal 2021, representing 67% of our fiscal
2021 consolidated net sales, and had net sales of $341.0 billion and $331.7 billion for fiscal 2020
and 2019, respectively. Of our three segments, Walmart U.S. has historically had the highest gross
profit as a percentage of net sales ("gross profit rate"). In addition, Walmart U.S. has historically
contributed the greatest amount to the Company's net sales and operating income.
Omni-channel. Walmart U.S. provides an omni-channel experience to customers, integrating retail
stores and eCommerce, through services such as pickup and delivery, ship-from-store, and digital
pharmacy fulfillment options. As of January 31, 2021, we had approximately 3,750 pickup locations and
3,000 delivery locations. Our Walmart+ membership incorporates several service offerings which
provide enhanced omni-channel shopping experiences and benefits for members. We have several
eCommerce websites, the largest of which is walmart.com. We define eCommerce sales as sales initiated
by customers digitally and fulfilled by a number of methods including our dedicated eCommerce
fulfillment centers and leveraging our stores. The following table provides the approximate size of
our retail stores as of January 31, 2021:
 Minimum Square Feet Maximum Square Feet Average Square Feet 
 Supercenters (general 
 merchandise and 69,000 260,000 178,000

 limited grocery) 
 Neighborhood 28,000 65,000 42,000 
 markets(1)(grocery) 
(1) Excludes other small formats.
Merchandise. Walmart U.S. does business in three strategic merchandise units, listed below:
• Grocery consists of a full line of grocery items, including dry grocery, snacks, dairy, meat,
produce, deli & bakery, frozen foods, alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages, as well as consumables
such as health and beauty aids, pet supplies, household chemicals, paper goods and baby products;
• General merchandise includes:
◦ Entertainment (e.g., electronics, toys, seasonal merchandise, wireless, video games, movies, music
and books);
◦ Hardlines (e.g., automotive, hardware and paint, sporting goods, outdoor living and stationery);
◦ Apparel (e.g., apparel for men, women, girls, boys and infants, as well as shoes, jewelry and
accessories); and
◦ Home (e.g., housewares and small appliances, bed & bath, furniture and home organization, home
furnishings, home decor, fabrics and crafts).
• Health and wellness includes pharmacy, over-the-counter drugs and other medical products, optical
services and clinical services.
Walmart U.S. recently launched Walmart+, a membership offering providing omni-channel shopping
benefits such as unlimited free shipping on eligible items with no order minimums, as well as
delivery and other benefits which help customers save more time and money. Walmart U.S. also offers
an in-house advertising offering via Walmart Connect, supply chain and fulfillment capabilities to
online marketplace sellers via Walmart Fulfillment Services, as well as quality, affordable, and
accessible healthcare via Walmart Health. Additional service offerings include fuel and financial
services and related products, such as money orders, prepaid cards, money (wire) transfers, check
cashing and bill payment. Combined, these offerings did not represent a significant portion of annual
segment revenues.
Brand name merchandise represents a significant portion of the merchandise sold in Walmart U.S. We
also market lines of merchandise under our private-label brands, including brands such as:
"Allswell," "Athletic Works," "Bonobos," "Eloquii,"
 7 
"Equate," "Freshness Guaranteed," "George," "Great Value," "Holiday Time," "Mainstays," "Marketside,"
"No Boundaries," "Onn," "Ozark Trail," "Parent's Choice," "Sam's Choice," "Scoop," "Spring Valley,"
"SwissTech," "Time and Tru" and "Wonder Nation." The Company also markets lines of merchandise under
licensed brands, some of which include: "Better Homes & Gardens," "Farberware," "Pioneer Woman" and
"Russell."
Periodically, revisions are made to the categorization of the components comprising our strategic
merchandise units. When revisions are made, the previous periods' presentation is adjusted to
maintain comparability.
Operations. Historically, many supercenters, discount stores and neighborhood markets were generally
open 24 hours each day. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we reduced store hours to allow for
additional cleaning and sanitizing but expanded store hours slightly toward the end of fiscal 2021.
Consistent with its strategy, Walmart U.S. continues to develop technology tools and services that
help better serve customers and help stores operate more efficiently, such as pickup and delivery,
Walmart+, ship-from-store and other initiatives which provide convenient and seamless omni-channel
shopping experiences.
Seasonal Aspects of Operations. Walmart U.S.'s business is seasonal to a certain extent due to
calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as different weather patterns.
Historically, its highest sales volume and segment operating income have occurred in the fiscal
quarter ending January 31. However, the COVID-19 pandemic may have an impact on consumer behaviors
that could result in temporary changes in the seasonal fluctuations of our business.
Competition. Walmart U.S. competes with omni-channel retailers operating discount, department, retail
and wholesale grocers, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, hypermarkets and
supercenter-type stores, as well as eCommerce retailers. Our ability to develop and operate units at
the right locations and to deliver a customer-centric omni-channel experience largely determines our
competitive position within the retail industry. We employ many programs designed to meet competitive
pressures within our industry. These programs include the following:
• EDLP: our pricing philosophy under which we price items at everyday low prices so our customers
trust that our prices will not change under frequent promotional activity;
• EDLC: everyday low cost is our commitment to control expenses so our cost savings can be passed
along to our customers; and
• Omni-channel offerings such as pickup and delivery and our new Walmart+ membership offering, all of
which enhance convenience and seek to serve customers in the ways they want to be served.
Distribution. For fiscal 2021, the majority of Walmart U.S.'s purchases of store merchandise were
shipped through our 156 distribution facilities, which are located strategically throughout the U.S.
The remaining store merchandise we purchased was shipped directly from suppliers. General merchandise
and dry grocery merchandise is transported primarily through the segment's private truck fleet;
however, we contract with common carriers to transport the majority of our perishable grocery
merchandise. We ship merchandise purchased by customers on our eCommerce platforms by a number of
methods from multiple locations including from our 32 dedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers, as
well as leveraging our ability to ship directly from approximately 3,000 stores.
 Walmart International Segment 
Walmart International is our second largest segment and operated in 25 countries outside of the U.S
as of January 31, 2021. Walmart International operated through our wholly-owned subsidiaries in
Canada, Chile, and China, as well as our businesses classified as held for sale in Japan and the
United Kingdom as of January 31, 2021. Walmart International also operates through our majority-owned
subsidiaries in Africa (which includes Botswana, Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia,
Nigeria, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia), Central America (which includes Costa
Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua), India and Mexico. Walmart International
previously operated in Argentina and Brazil prior to the sale of Walmart Argentina in fiscal 2021 and
the majority stake of Walmart Brazil in fiscal 2019. Refer to Note 12 for discussion of recent
divestitures.
Walmart International includes numerous formats divided into three major categories: retail,
wholesale and other. These categories consist of many formats, including: supercenters, supermarkets,
hypermarkets, warehouse clubs (including Sam's Clubs) and cash & carry, as well as eCommerce through
walmart.com.mx, walmart.ca, flipkart.com and other sites. Walmart International had net sales of
$121.4 billion for fiscal 2021, representing 22% of our fiscal 2021 consolidated net sales, and had
net sales of $120.1 billion and $120.8 billion for fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. The segment's
net sales were negatively impacted by currency exchange rate fluctuations for all years presented.
The gross profit rate is lower than that of Walmart U.S. primarily because of its merchandise mix.
 8 
Walmart International's strategy is to create strong local businesses powered by Walmart which means
being locally relevant and customer-focused in each of the markets it operates. We are being
deliberate about where and how we choose to operate and continue to re-shape the portfolio to best
enable long-term, sustainable and profitable growth. As such, we have taken certain strategic actions
to strengthen our Walmart International portfolio for the long-term, which include the following
highlights over the last three years:
• Acquisition of a majority stake of Flipkart in August 2018.
• Divestiture of 80 percent of Walmart Brazil in August 2018.
• Divestiture of the Walmart Chile banking operations in December 2018 and the divestiture of the
Walmart Canada banking operations in April 2019.
• Divestiture of Walmart Argentina in November 2020.
• Divestiture of Asda Group Limited ("Asda”), our retail operations in the U.K., in February 2021.
• Divestiture of a majority stake in Seiyu, our retail operations in Japan, in March 2021.
Omni-channel. Walmart International provides an omni-channel experience to customers, integrating
retail stores and eCommerce, such as through pickup and delivery services in most of our markets, our
marketplaces such as Flipkart in India, and a digital transaction platform anchored in payments such
as PhonePe in India. In China, our partnerships with JD.com and JD Daojia provide customers one-hour
delivery by leveraging Walmart stores as fulfillment centers.
Generally, retail units' selling area range in size from 1,400 square feet to 186,000 square feet.
Our wholesale stores' selling area generally range in size from 24,000 square feet to 156,000 square
feet. As of January 31, 2021, Walmart International had approximately 3,000 pickup and 2,200 delivery
locations.
Merchandise. The merchandising strategy for Walmart International is similar to that of our
operations in the U.S. in terms of the breadth and scope of merchandise offered for sale. While brand
name merchandise accounts for a majority of our sales, we have both leveraged U.S. private brands and
developed market specific private brands to serve our customers with high quality, low priced items.
Along with the private brands we market globally, such as "Equate," "George," "Great Value," "Holiday
Time," "Mainstays," "Marketside" and "Parent's Choice," our international markets have developed
market specific brands including "Aurrera," "Cambridge," "Lider," "Myntra," and "PhonePe." In
addition, we have developed and continue to grow our relationships with regional and local suppliers
in each market to ensure reliable sources of quality merchandise that is equal to national brands at
low prices.
Walmart International also offers fuel, financial services and related products in various markets.
Our businesses in Mexico and Canada, for example, offer prepaid cards and money (wire) transfers, and
our PhonePe business in India provides a platform that offers mobile and bill payment, person-to-
person (P2P) payment, investment and insurance solutions, financial services and advertising.
Combined, these offerings did not represent a significant portion of annual segment revenues.
Operations. The hours of operation for operating units in Walmart International vary by country and
by individual markets within countries, depending upon local and national ordinances governing hours
of operation. Toward the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, government mandates led to extensive
store and operational closures in several of our international markets as well as limitations on
certain merchandise sales in select markets. While most closed stores and warehouses resumed
operations by the end of fiscal 2021, store hours have been partially reduced or modified in several
markets. Additionally, several markets implemented enhanced safety and sanitization protocols, as
well as provided increased customer options and capacity for pickup and delivery services.
Seasonal Aspects of Operations. Walmart International's business is seasonal to a certain extent.
Historically, its highest sales volume and operating income have occurred in the fourth quarter of
our fiscal year. The seasonality of the business varies by country due to different national and
religious holidays, festivals and customs, as well as different weather patterns. However, the
COVID-19 pandemic may have an impact on consumer behaviors that could result in temporary changes in
the seasonal fluctuations of our business.
Competition. Walmart International competes with omni-channel retailers who operate department, drug,
discount, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, hypermarkets and supercenter-type stores,
wholesale clubs, home-improvement stores, specialty electronics stores, cash & carry operations and
convenience stores, and eCommerce retailers, as well as catalog businesses. Our ability to develop
and operate units at the right locations and to deliver a customer-centric omni-channel experience
largely determines our competitive position within the retail industry. We believe price leadership
is a critical part of our business model and we continue to focus on moving our markets towards an
EDLP approach. Additionally, our ability to operate food departments effectively has a significant
impact on our competitive position in the markets where we operate.
 9 
Distribution. We utilize a total of 221 distribution facilities located in Canada, Central America,
Chile, China, India, Mexico and South Africa, as well as Japan and the United Kingdom, whose
operations are classified as held for sale as of January 31, 2021, and subsequently divested in the
first quarter of fiscal 2022. Through these facilities, we process and distribute both imported and
domestic products to the operating units of the Walmart International segment. During fiscal 2021,
the majority of Walmart International's purchases passed through these distribution facilities.
Suppliers ship the remainder of Walmart International's purchases directly to our stores in the
various markets in which we operate. Across the segment, we have efficient networks connecting
physical stores and distribution and fulfillment centers which facilitate the movement of goods to
where our customers live. We ship merchandise purchased by customers on our eCommerce platforms by a
number of methods from multiple locations including from our 83 dedicated eCommerce fulfillment
centers, more than 2,800 eCommerce sort centers and last-mile delivery facilities in India, as well
as our physical retail stores.
 Sam's Club Segment 
Sam's Club operates in 44 states in the U.S. and in Puerto Rico. Sam's Club is a membership-only
warehouse club that also operates samsclub.com. Sam's Club had net sales of $63.9 billion for fiscal
2021, representing 11% of our consolidated fiscal 2021 net sales, and had net sales of $58.8 billion
and $57.8 billion for fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. As a membership-only warehouse club,
membership income is a significant component of the segment's operating income. Sam's Club operates
with a lower gross profit rate and lower operating expenses as a percentage of net sales than our
other segments.
Membership. The following two options are available to members:
 Plus Membership Club Membership 
 Annual Membership Fee $100 $45 
 Number of Add-on Memberships ($40 each) Up to 16 Up to 8

size, and receive discounts on prescriptions and glasses.
Omni-channel. Sam's Club is a membership-only warehouse club which provides an omni-channel
experience to customers, integrating retail stores and eCommerce through such services as Curbside
Pickup, mobile Scan & Go, and ship-from-club. Members have access to a broad assortment of
merchandise and services, including those not found in our clubs, online at samsclub.com and through
our mobile commerce applications. The warehouse facility sizes generally range between 32,000 and
168,000 square feet, with an average size of approximately 134,000 square feet.
Merchandise. Sam's Club offers merchandise in the following five merchandise categories:
• Grocery and consumables includes dairy, meat, bakery, deli, produce, dry, chilled or frozen
packaged foods, alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages, floral, snack foods, candy, other grocery

In addition, the Member's Mark private label brand continues to expand assortment and deliver member
value.
Operations. Operating hours for Sam's Clubs are generally Monday through Friday from 10:00 a.m. to
8:00 p.m., Saturday from 9:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. and Sunday from 10:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. Additionally,
most club locations offer Plus Members the ability to shop before the regular operating hours Monday
through Saturday, starting at 8:00 a.m. While store operating hours generally remained stable during
the COVID-19 pandemic, designated “Hero Hours” were also established for first responders, health
care workers, and associates. Consistent with its strategy, Sam's Club continues to develop
technology tools to drive a great member experience. During the pandemic, Curbside Pickup was
launched at all clubs to help provide fast, easy and contact-free shopping for members. Sam's Club
also offers "Scan & Go," a mobile checkout and payment solution, which allows members to bypass the
checkout line.
 10 
Seasonal Aspects of Operations. Sam's Club's business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar
events and national and religious holidays, as well as different weather patterns. Historically, its
highest sales volume has occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31. However, the COVID-19
pandemic may have an impact on consumer behaviors that could result in temporary changes in the
seasonal fluctuations of our business.
Competition. Sam's Club competes with other membership-only warehouse clubs, the largest of which is
Costco, as well as with discount retailers, retail and wholesale grocers, general merchandise
wholesalers and distributors, gasoline stations as well as omni-channel and eCommerce retailers and
catalog businesses. At Sam's Club, we provide value at members-only prices, a quality merchandise
assortment, and bulk sizing to serve both our Plus and Club members. Our eCommerce website and mobile
commerce applications have increasingly become important factors in our ability to compete and
recently enabled the launch of Curbside Pickup across all clubs.
Distribution. During fiscal 2021, the majority of Sam's Club's non-fuel club purchases were shipped
from Sam's Club's 27 dedicated distribution facilities, located strategically throughout the U.S., or
from some of the Walmart U.S. segment's distribution facilities, which service the Sam's Club segment
for certain items. Suppliers shipped the remainder of the Sam's Club segment's club purchases
directly to Sam's Club locations. Sam's Club ships merchandise purchased on samsclub.com and through
its mobile commerce applications by a number of methods including shipments made directly from clubs,
11 dedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers and other distribution centers.
Sam's Club uses a combination of our private truck fleet, as well as common carriers, to transport
non-perishable merchandise from distribution facilities to clubs. The segment contracts with common
carriers to transport perishable grocery merchandise from distribution facilities to clubs.
 Intellectual Property 
We regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade
secrets, proprietary technologies, and similar intellectual property as important to our success, and
with respect to our associates, customers and others, we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent
law, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements to protect our
proprietary rights. We have registered, or applied for the registration of, a number of U.S. and
international domain names, trademarks, service marks and copyrights. Additionally, we have filed
U.S. and international patent applications covering certain of our proprietary technology. We have
licensed in the past, and expect that we may license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights
to third parties.
 Suppliers and Supply Chain 
As a retailer and warehouse club operator, we utilize a global supply chain that includes both U.S.
and international suppliers from whom we purchase the merchandise that we sell in our stores, clubs
and online. In many instances, we purchase merchandise from producers located near the stores and
clubs in which such merchandise will be sold, particularly products in the "fresh" category. Our
purchases may represent a significant percentage of the annual sales for a number of our suppliers,
and the volume of product we acquire from many suppliers allows us to obtain favorable pricing from
such suppliers. Our suppliers are subject to standards of conduct, including requirements that they
comply with local labor laws, local worker safety laws and other applicable laws. Our ability to
acquire from our suppliers the assortment and volume of products we wish to offer to our customer, to
receive those products within the required time through our supply chain and to distribute those
products to our stores and clubs determines, in part, our in-stock levels in our stores and clubs and
the attractiveness of our merchandise assortment we offer to our customers and members.
 Government Regulation 
As a company with global operations, we are subject to the laws of the United States and multiple
foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies,
which may differ among jurisdictions. For additional information, see the risk factors herein in "
Item 1A . Risk Factors " under the sub-caption “Legal, Tax, Regulatory, Compliance, Reputational and
Other Risks".

 Human Capital Management 
Our commitment to help people around the world save money and live better is delivered by our
associates who make the difference for our customers every day. As of the end of fiscal 2021, we
employed more than 2.3 million associates worldwide, with 1.6 million associates in the U.S. and 0.7
million associates internationally. In the U.S., approximately 94% of these associates are hourly and
approximately 64% are full-time.
We believe the strength of our workforce is a significant contributor to our success. Walmart is a
place of opportunity, not only as a foundational entry point to develop critical skills that are
relevant for a variety of careers, but also a place where people can grow in their careers across our
global omni-channel business. As customer demands and technology change the nature of work, we need
to attract, develop and retain associates to thrive in an ever-changing omni-channel environment.
Approximately 75% of our U.S. salaried store, club and supply chain management started their careers
in hourly positions. We believe our focus on improving career paths for our associates through robust
training, competitive wages, new ways of working, and opportunities for advancement has improved
turnover in the U.S. over the past few years.
Our workforce strategy includes the following strategic priorities:
Inclusion - Build a Walmart for everyone: a diverse, equitable and inclusive company, where
associates' ideas and opinions matter . We are focused on creating an inclusive culture and a diverse
associate base, where all associates believe they belong and are empowered to be themselves, which we
believe is important in serving our customers now and in the future. Management provides recurring
culture, diversity, equity and inclusion updates to senior leadership, including our President and
CEO, and the Compensation, Management and Development Committee of the Board of Directors. Of the
more than 2.3 million associates employed worldwide, 54% identify as women. In the U.S., 47% of the
1.6 million associates identify as ethnically diverse.
We review our processes regarding our commitment to fair-pay practices. We are committed to creating
a performance culture where associates are rewarded based on meaningful factors such as
qualifications, experience, performance and the type of work they do.
To build a company where associates feel valued and heard, we gather and respond to associates’
feedback in a variety of ways, including but not limited to an anonymous, periodic, formal, associate
engagement survey, our Open Door process, and one-on-one interactions. Management reviews the results
of feedback obtained from our formal associate engagement survey. Feedback and suggestions received
through these channels have led to meaningful changes in our business, including a new U.S.
attendance policy, for example.
Well-being - Focus on the physical, emotional, and financial well-being of our associates. We invest
in our associates by offering competitive wages including bonuses based on Company performance, as
well as a broad range of benefits that vary based on customary local practices and statutory
requirements and believe these investments in our associates are important to our future. In the
U.S., we offer affordable healthcare coverage to our full-time and eligible part-time associates, as
well as Company paid benefits such as a store discount card or Sam's Club membership, 401(k) match,
maternity leave, a paid parental leave program to all full-time associates, paid time off, Associate
Stock Purchase Plan match, life insurance and behavioral health services. Certain information
relating to retirement-related benefits we provide to our associates is included in Note 11 to our
Consolidated Financial Statements.
In fiscal 2021, we added incremental benefits to support associate health and well-being during the
COVID-19 pandemic. We provided extra pay and benefits, including special cash bonuses totaling $1.6
billion, and the introduction of the COVID-19 Emergency Leave Policy in the U.S. See " COVID-19
Updates " in Management's Discussion and Analysis for additional information regarding our response
to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Growth - Provide ongoing growth, development and learning opportunities for associates and continue
to attract talent with new skills. To help associates acquire the experiences and skills needed for
success in the jobs of today and tomorrow, we have invested in their development – including new
roles and career paths, cross-training, on-the-job coaching, and formal, classroom-style training
such as Walmart Academy in the U.S. We also provide access to educational opportunities for our
eligible associates through our Live Better U program, which provides a pathway to earn a high school
diploma at no cost or a college degree for $1 a day, as well as multiple digital learning
opportunities.
Digital - Accelerate digital transformation and ways of working to improve the associate experience
and drive business results . To deliver a seamless customer and associate experience, we continue to
invest in digital tools to improve associate productivity, engagement, and performance. As more
customers shop digitally, we have adapted by adding more roles in eCommerce fulfillment and our home
office associates have accelerated tech-based solutions that enhance the customer and associate
experiences.

 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
The risks described below could, in ways we may or may not be able to accurately predict, materially
and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial position and liquidity. Our
business operations could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies
operating in the U.S. and globally. The following risk factors do not identify all risks that we may
face.
 Strategic Risks 
Failure to successfully execute our omni-channel strategy and the cost of our investments in
eCommerce and technology may materially adversely affect our market position, net sales and financial
performance.
The retail business continues to rapidly evolve and consumers increasingly embrace digital shopping.
As a result, the portion of total consumer expenditures with retailers and wholesale clubs occurring
through digital platforms is increasing and the pace of this increase could continue to accelerate.
Our strategy, which includes investments in eCommerce, technology, acquisitions, joint ventures,
store remodels and other customer initiatives, may not adequately or effectively allow us to continue
to grow our eCommerce business, increase comparable store sales, maintain or grow our overall market
position or otherwise offset the impact on the growth of our business of a moderated pace of new
store and club openings. The success of this strategy will depend in large measure on our ability to
continue building and delivering a seamless omni-channel shopping experience for our customers and is
further subject to the related risks discussed in this Item 1A . Failure to successfully execute this
strategy may adversely affect our market position, net sales and financial performance which could
also result in impairment charges to intangible assets or other long-lived assets. In addition, a
greater concentration of eCommerce sales, including increasing online grocery sales, could result in
a reduction in the amount of traffic in our stores and clubs, which would, in turn, reduce the
opportunities for cross-store or cross-club sales of merchandise that such traffic creates and could
reduce our sales within our stores and clubs and materially adversely affect our financial
performance.
Furthermore, the cost of certain eCommerce and technology investments, including any operating losses
incurred, will adversely impact our financial performance in the short-term and failure to realize
the benefits of these investments may adversely impact our financial performance over the longer
term.
If we do not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends or preferences, it could
negatively affect our relationship with our customers, demand for the products and services we sell,
our market share and the growth of our business.
It is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will
demand and changes in their shopping patterns. The success of our business depends in part on how
accurately we predict consumer demand, availability of merchandise, the related impact on the demand
for existing products and the competitive environment. Price transparency, assortment of products,
customer experience, convenience, ease and the speed and cost of shipping are of primary importance
to customers and continue to increase in importance, particularly as a result of digital tools and
social media available to consumers and the choices available to consumers for purchasing products.
Our failure to adequately or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences (including
those related to sustainability) and shopping patterns, or any other failure on our part to timely
identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences and shopping patterns could
negatively affect our reputation and relationship with our customers, the demand for the products we
sell or services we offer, our market share and the growth of our business.
 14 
We face strong competition from other retailers and wholesale club operators which could materially
adversely affect our financial performance.
Each of our segments competes for customers, employees, digital prominence, products and services and
in other important aspects of its business with many other local, regional, national and global
physical, eCommerce and omni-channel retailers, wholesale club operators and retail intermediaries.
We compete in a variety of ways, including the prices at which we sell our merchandise, merchandise
selection and availability, services offered to customers, location, store hours, in-store amenities,
the shopping convenience and overall shopping experience we offer, the attractiveness and ease of use
of our digital platforms, cost and speed of and options for delivery to customers of merchandise
purchased through our digital platforms or through our omni-channel integration of our physical and
digital operations.
A failure to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets or delays
or failure in execution of our strategy could materially adversely affect our financial performance.
See " Item 1. Business " above for additional discussion of the competitive situation of each of our
reportable segments.
Certain segments of the retail industry are undergoing consolidation or substantially reducing
operations, whether due to bankruptcy, consolidation or other factors. Such consolidation, or other
business combinations or alliances, or reduction in operation may result in competitors with greatly
improved financial resources, improved access to merchandise, greater market penetration than they
previously enjoyed and other improvements in their competitive positions. Such business combinations
or alliances could result in the provision of a wider variety of products and services at competitive
prices by such consolidated or aligned companies, which could adversely affect our financial
performance.
General or macro-economic factors, both domestically and internationally, may materially adversely
affect our financial performance.
General economic conditions and other economic factors, globally or in one or more of the markets we
serve, may adversely affect our financial performance. Higher interest rates, lower or higher prices
of petroleum products, including crude oil, natural gas, gasoline, and diesel fuel, higher costs for
electricity and other energy, weakness in the housing market, inflation, deflation, increased costs
of essential services, such as medical care and utilities, higher levels of unemployment, decreases
in consumer disposable income, unavailability of consumer credit, higher consumer debt levels,
changes in consumer spending and shopping patterns, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, higher
tax rates, imposition of new taxes or other changes in tax laws, changes in healthcare laws, other
regulatory changes, the imposition of tariffs or other measures that create barriers to or increase
the costs associated with international trade, overall economic slowdown or recession and other
economic factors in the U.S. or in any of the other markets in which we operate could adversely
affect consumer demand for the products we sell in the U.S. or such other markets, change the mix of
products we sell to one with a lower average gross margin, cause a slowdown in discretionary
purchases of goods, adversely affect our net sales and result in slower inventory turnover and
greater markdowns of inventory, or otherwise materially adversely affect our operations and operating
results and could result in impairment charges to intangible assets, goodwill or other long-lived
assets.
In addition, the economic factors listed above, any other economic factors or circumstances resulting
in higher transportation, labor, insurance or healthcare costs or commodity prices, and other
economic factors in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate can increase our cost of sales
and operating, selling, general and administrative expenses and otherwise materially adversely affect
our operations and operating results.
The economic factors that affect our operations may also adversely affect the operations of our
suppliers, which can result in an increase in the cost to us of the goods we sell to our customers
or, in more extreme cases, in certain suppliers not producing goods in the volume typically available
to us for sale.
The performance of strategic alliances and other business relationships to support the expansion of
our business could materially adversely affect our financial performance.
We may enter into strategic alliances and other business relationships in the countries in which we
have existing operations or in other markets to expand our business. These arrangements may not
generate the level of sales we anticipate when entering into the arrangement or may otherwise
adversely impact our business and competitive position relative to the results we could have achieved
in the absence of such alliance. In addition, any investment we make in connection with a strategic
alliance, business relationship or in certain of our recently divested markets, could materially
adversely affect our financial performance.
 15 
 Operational Risks 
The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial position and results of operations is
in many respects unpredictable, and we may be unable to sustain our revenue growth rate in the
future.
The continuing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic are highly unpredictable and volatile, with varying
impacts on certain business operations, demand for our products and services, in-stock positions,
costs of doing business, access to inventory, supply chain operations, our ability to predict future
performance, exposure to litigation, and our financial performance, among other things.
The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in widespread and continuing impacts on the global economy and on
our domestic and international associates, members, suppliers and other people and entities with
which we do business. There is considerable uncertainty regarding the extent to which COVID-19 will
continue to spread and the extent and duration of measures to try to contain the virus, such as
travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and business and government
shutdowns and other restrictions on retailers.
Customer demand for certain products has also fluctuated as the pandemic has progressed and customer
behaviors have changed, which has challenged our ability to anticipate and/or adjust inventory levels
to meet that demand. These factors have resulted in higher out-of-stock positions in certain
products, as well as delays in delivering those products, and could impact inventory levels in the
future.
Other factors and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: the severity and duration of the
pandemic, including whether there are additional outbreaks or spikes in the number of COVID-19 cases,
future mutations or related strains of the virus in areas in which we operate; further increased
operational costs associated with operating during a global pandemic; evolving macroeconomic factors,
including general economic uncertainty, unemployment rates, and recessionary pressures; unknown
consequences on our business performance and initiatives stemming from the substantial investment of
time, capital and other resources to the pandemic response; the availability of, and prevalence of
access to, effective medical treatments and vaccines for COVID-19; the pace of recovery when the
pandemic subsides; and the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, including
consumer behaviors. These risks and their impacts are difficult to predict and could otherwise
disrupt and adversely affect our operations and our financial performance.
The COVID-19 pandemic has led to increased revenue growth relative to historic trends, and has
particularly accelerated our eCommerce growth. These results, as well as those of other metrics such
as net income and other financial and operating data, may not be indicative of results for future
periods. Once the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, particularly as vaccines become more
widely available, and customers return to work or school or are otherwise no longer subject to the
aforementioned containment directives and similar mandates, a failure by us to continue capitalizing
on growth opportunities may result in declining revenue and future operating results may fall below
expectations.
To the extent that the COVID-19 pandemic continues to adversely affect the U.S. and the global
economy, it may also heighten other risks described in this section, including but not limited to
those related to consumer behavior and expectations, competition, our reputation, implementation of
strategic initiatives, cybersecurity threats, payment-related risks, technology systems disruption,
supply chain disruptions, labor availability and cost, litigation, and regulatory requirements.
Natural disasters, climate change, geopolitical events, global health epidemics or pandemics and
catastrophic events could materially adversely affect our financial performance.
The occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tropical storms, floods, fires,
earthquakes, tsunamis, cyclones, typhoons; weather conditions such as major or extended winter
storms, droughts and tornadoes, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise; geopolitical
events; global health epidemics or pandemics or other contagious outbreaks such as the ongoing
COVID-19 pandemic; and catastrophic events, such as war, civil unrest, terrorist attacks or other
acts of violence, including active shooter situations (such as those that have occurred in our U.S.
stores), in countries in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located, could adversely
affect our operations and financial performance.
Such events could result in physical damage to, or the complete loss of, one or more of our
properties, the closure of one or more stores, clubs and distribution or fulfillment centers,
limitations on store or club operating hours, the lack of an adequate work force in a market, the
inability of customers and associates to reach or have transportation to our stores and clubs
affected by such events, the evacuation of the populace from areas in which our stores, clubs and
distribution and fulfillment centers are located, the unavailability of our digital platforms to our
customers, changes in the purchasing patterns of consumers (including the frequency of visits by
consumers to physical retail locations, whether as a result of limitations on large gatherings,
travel and movement limitations or otherwise) and in consumers' disposable income, the temporary or
long-term disruption in the supply of products from some suppliers, the disruption in the transport
of goods from overseas, the disruption or delay in the delivery of goods to our distribution and
fulfillment centers or stores within a country in which we are operating, the reduction in the
availability of products in our stores, the disruption of utility services to our stores and our
facilities, and the disruption in our communications with our stores.
 16 
Furthermore, the long-term impacts of climate change, whether involving physical risks (such as
extreme weather conditions or rising sea levels) or transition risks (such as regulatory or
technology changes) are expected to be widespread and unpredictable. These changes over time could
affect, for example, the availability and cost of certain consumer products, commodities and energy
(including utilities), which in turn may impact our ability to procure those certain goods or
services required for the operation of our business at the quantities and levels we require.
We bear the risk of losses incurred as a result of physical damage to, or destruction of, any stores,
clubs and distribution or fulfillment centers, loss or spoilage of inventory and business
interruption caused by such events. These events and their impacts could otherwise disrupt and
adversely affect our operations in the areas in which they occur and could materially adversely
affect our financial performance.
Risks associated with our suppliers could materially adversely affect our financial performance.
The products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers. Global
sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance. We
expect our suppliers to comply with applicable laws, including labor, safety, anti-corruption and
environmental laws, and to otherwise meet our required supplier standards of conduct. Our ability to
find qualified suppliers who uphold our standards, and to access products in a timely and efficient
manner and in the large volumes we may demand, is a significant challenge, especially with respect to
suppliers located and goods sourced outside the U.S.
Political and economic instability, as well as other impactful events and circumstances in the
countries in which our suppliers and their manufacturers are located (such as the ongoing COVID-19
pandemic), the financial instability of suppliers, suppliers' failure to meet our terms and
conditions or our supplier standards (including our responsible sourcing standards), labor problems
experienced by our suppliers and their manufacturers, the availability of raw materials to suppliers,
merchandise safety and quality issues, disruption or delay in the transportation of merchandise from
the suppliers and manufacturers to our stores, clubs, and other facilities, including as a result of
labor slowdowns at any port at which a material amount of merchandise we purchase enters into the
markets in which we operate, currency exchange rates, transport availability and cost, transport
security, inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are
located are beyond our control.
In addition, the U.S. foreign trade policies, tariffs and other impositions on imported goods, trade
sanctions imposed on certain countries and entities, the limitation on the importation of certain
types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors
relating to foreign trade are beyond our control. These and other factors affecting our suppliers and
our access to products could adversely affect our financial performance.
If the products we sell are not safe or otherwise fail to meet our customers' expectations, we could
lose customers, incur liability for any injuries suffered by customers using or consuming a product
we sell or otherwise experience a material impact to our brand, reputation and financial performance.
We are also subject to reputational and other risks related to third-party sales on our digital
platforms.
Our customers count on us to provide them with safe products. Concerns regarding the safety of food
and non-food products that we source from our suppliers or that we prepare and then sell could cause
customers to avoid purchasing certain products from us, or to seek alternative sources of supply for
all of their food and non-food needs, even if the basis for the concern is outside of our control.
Any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish and
such products also expose us to product liability or food safety claims. As such, any issue regarding
the safety of any food or non-food items we sell, regardless of the cause, could adversely affect our
brand, reputation and financial performance. In addition, third-parties sell goods on some of our
digital platforms, which we refer to as marketplace transactions. Whether laws related to such sales
apply to us is currently unsettled and any unfavorable changes could expose us to loss of sales,
reduction in transactions and deterioration of our competitive position. In addition, we may face
reputational, financial and other risks, including liability, for third-party sales of goods that are
controversial, counterfeit or otherwise fail to comply with applicable law. Although we impose
contractual terms on sellers that are intended to prohibit sales of certain type of products, we may
not be able to detect, enforce, or collect sufficient damages for breaches of such agreements. Any of
these events could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations and
impede the execution of our eCommerce growth strategy.
We rely extensively on information systems to process transactions, summarize results and manage our
business. Disruptions in our systems could harm our ability to conduct our operations.
Given the number of individual transactions we have each year, it is crucial that we maintain
uninterrupted operation of our business-critical information systems. Our information systems are
subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures,
computer viruses, worms, other malicious computer programs, denial-of-service attacks, security
breaches (through cyberattacks from cyberattackers and sophisticated organizations including nation
states), catastrophic events such as fires, tornadoes, earthquakes and hurricanes, and usage errors
by our associates or contractors. Our information systems are essential to our business operations,
including the processing of transactions, management of our associates, facilities, logistics,
inventories, physical stores and clubs and our online operations. Our information systems are not
 17 
fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. If our
systems are damaged, breached or cease to function properly, we may have to make a significant
investment to repair or replace them, and may experience loss or corruption of critical data as well
as suffer interruptions in our business operations in the interim. Any interruption to our
information systems may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. In
addition, we are constantly updating our information technology processes and systems. The risk of
system disruption is increased when significant system changes are undertaken. If we fail to timely
integrate and update our information systems and processes, we may fail to realize the cost savings
or operational benefits anticipated to be derived from these initiatives.
If the technology-based systems that give our customers the ability to shop with us online do not
function effectively, our operating results, as well as our ability to grow our omni-channel business
globally, could be materially adversely affected.
Increasingly, customers are using computers, tablets, and smart phones to shop with us and with our
competitors and to do comparison shopping. We use social media, online advertising, and email to
interact with our customers and as a means to enhance their shopping experience. As a part of our
omni-channel sales strategy, we offer various pickup, delivery and shipping programs including
options where many products available for purchase online can be picked up by the customer or member
at a local Walmart store or Sam's Club, which provides additional customer traffic at such stores and
clubs. Omni-channel retailing is a rapidly evolving part of the retail industry and of our operations
around the world. We must anticipate and meet our customers' changing expectations while adjusting
for technology investments and developments in our competitors' operations through focusing on the
building and delivery of a seamless shopping experience across all channels by each operating
segment. Any failure on our part to provide attractive, user-friendly secure digital platforms that
offer a wide assortment of merchandise at competitive prices and with low cost and rapid delivery
options and that continually meet the changing expectations of online shoppers and developments in
online and digital platform merchandising and related technology could place us at a competitive
disadvantage, result in the loss of eCommerce and other sales, harm our reputation with customers,
have a material adverse impact on the growth of our eCommerce business globally and have a material
adverse impact on our business and results of operations.
Our digital platforms, which are increasingly important to our business and continue to grow in
complexity and scope, and the systems on which they run, including those applications and systems in
our acquired eCommerce businesses, are regularly subject to cyberattacks. Those attacks involve
attempts to gain unauthorized access to our eCommerce websites (including marketplace platforms) or
mobile commerce applications to obtain and misuse customers' or members' information including
payment information and related risks discussed in this Item 1A . Such attacks, if successful, in
addition to potential data misuse and/or loss, may also create denials of service or otherwise
disable, degrade or sabotage one or more of our digital platforms or otherwise significantly disrupt
our customers' and members' shopping experience, our supply chain integrity and continuity, and our
ability to efficiently operate our business. If we are unable to maintain the security of our digital
platforms and keep them operating within acceptable parameters, we could suffer loss of sales,
reductions in transactions, reputational damage and deterioration of our competitive position and
incur liability for any damage to customers or others whose personal or confidential information is
unlawfully obtained and misused, any of which events could have a material adverse impact on our
business and results of operations and impede the execution of our strategy for the growth of our
business.
Any failure to maintain the security of the information relating to our company, customers, members,
associates and vendors, whether as a result of cybersecurity attacks on our information systems or
otherwise, could damage our reputation, result in litigation or other legal actions against us, cause
us to incur substantial additional costs, and materially adversely affect our business and operating
results.
Like most retailers, we receive and store in our information systems personal information about our
customers and members, and we receive and store personal information concerning our associates and
vendors. Some of that information is stored digitally in connection with our digital platforms. We
also utilize third-party service providers for a variety of reasons, including, without limitation,
for digital storage technology, content delivery to customers and members, back-office support, and
other functions. Such providers may have access to information we hold about our customers, members,
associates or vendors. In addition, our eCommerce operations depend upon the secure transmission of
confidential information over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments.
Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and those threats and the means for obtaining access to
information in digital and other storage media are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Cyber threats
and cyberattackers can be sponsored by countries or sophisticated criminal organizations or be the
work of hackers with a wide range of motives and expertise. We and the businesses with which we
interact have experienced and continue to experience threats to data and systems, including by
perpetrators of random or targeted malicious cyberattacks, computer viruses, worms, bot attacks,
ransomware or other destructive or disruptive software and attempts to misappropriate customer
information, including credit card and payment information, and cause system failures and
disruptions. The increased use of remote work infrastructure due to the COVID-19 pandemic has also
increased the possible attack surfaces. Some of our systems and third-party service providers'
systems have experienced limited security breaches or incidents and although they did not have a
material adverse effect on our operating results, there can be no assurance of a similar result in
the future.
 18 
Associate error or malfeasance, faulty password management, social engineering or other
vulnerabilities and irregularities may also result in a defeat of our or our third-party service
providers' security measures and a breach of our or their information systems. Moreover, hardware,
software or applications we use may have inherent vulnerabilities or defects of design, manufacture
or operations or could be inadvertently or intentionally implemented or used in a manner that could
compromise information security.
Any compromise of our data security systems or of those of businesses with which we interact, which
results in confidential information being accessed, obtained, damaged, disclosed, destroyed,
modified, lost or used by unauthorized persons could harm our reputation and expose us to regulatory
actions, customer attrition, remediation expenses, and claims from customers, members, associates,
vendors, financial institutions, payment card networks and other persons, any of which could
materially and adversely affect our business operations, financial position and results of
operations. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or
sabotage systems change frequently and may not immediately produce signs of a compromise, we may be
unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures and we or our
third-party service providers may not discover any security breach, vulnerability or compromise of
information for a significant period of time after the security incident occurs. To the extent that
any cyberattack, ransomware or incursion in our or one of our third-party service provider's
information systems results in the loss, damage, misappropriation or other compromise of information,
we may be materially adversely affected by claims from customers, financial institutions, regulatory
authorities, payment card networks and others.
Our compliance programs, information technology, and enterprise risk management efforts cannot
eliminate all systemic risk. Disruptions in our systems caused by security breaches or cyberattacks –
including attacks on those parties we do business with – could harm our ability to conduct our
operations, which may have a material effect on us, may result in losses that could have a material
adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations, or may have a cascading effect
that adversely impacts our partners, third-party service providers, customers, financial services
firms, and other third parties that we interact with on a regular basis.
In addition, such security-related events could be widely publicized and could materially adversely
affect our reputation with our customers, members, associates, vendors and shareholders, could harm
our competitive position particularly with respect to our eCommerce operations, and could result in a
material reduction in our net sales in our eCommerce operations, as well as in our stores thereby
materially adversely affecting our operations, net sales, results of operations, financial position,
cash flows and liquidity. Such events could also result in the release to the public of confidential
information about our operations and financial position and performance and could result in
litigation or other legal actions against us or the imposition of penalties, fines, fees or
liabilities, which may not be covered by our insurance policies. Moreover, a security compromise or
ransomware event could require us to devote significant management resources to address the problems
created by the issue and to expend significant additional resources to upgrade further the security
measures we employ to guard personal and confidential information against cyberattacks and other
attempts to access or otherwise compromise such information and could result in a disruption of our
operations, particularly our digital operations.
We accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash, checks, credit and debit cards, and
our private label credit cards and gift cards, and we may offer new payment options over time, which
may have information security risk implications. As a retailer accepting debit and credit cards for
payment, we are subject to various industry data protection standards and protocols, such as payment
network security operating guidelines and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. We cannot
be certain that the security measures we maintain to protect all of our information technology
systems are able to prevent, contain or detect cyberattacks, cyberterrorism, security breaches or
other compromises from known malware or ransomware or other threats that may be developed in the
future. In certain circumstances, our contracts with payment card processors and payment card
networks (such as Visa, Mastercard, American Express and Discover) generally require us to adhere to
payment card network rules which could make us liable to payment card issuers and others if
information in connection with payment cards and payment card transactions that we process is
compromised, which liabilities could be substantial.
Additionally, we offer money (wire) transfer services, digital payment platforms, bill payment, money
orders and check cashing and we sell prepaid cards and gift cards. We further offer co-branded credit
cards and installment loans through financial services partners. These products and services require
us to comply with legal and regulatory requirements, including global anti-money laundering and
sanctions laws and regulations as well as international, federal and state consumer financial laws
and regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines, sanctions,
penalties and harm to our reputation.
The Company also has compliance obligations associated with new privacy laws enacted to protect and
regulate the collection, use, retention, disclosure and transfer of personal information, which
include statutory liability for security breaches. Consequently, cybersecurity attacks that cause a
data breach could subject us to fines, sanctions and other legal liability and harm our reputation.
 19 
Changes in the results of our health and wellness business could adversely affect our overall results
of operations, cash flows and liquidity.
Walmart has retail pharmacy operations in our Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments, as well as the
recent addition of Walmart Health Centers in a number of states. A large majority of our retail
pharmacy net sales are generated by filling prescriptions for which we receive payment through
established contractual relationships with third-party payers and payment administrators, such as
private insurers, governmental agencies and pharmacy benefit managers ("PBMs").
Our retail pharmacy operations are subject to numerous risks, including: reductions in the third-
party reimbursement rates for drugs; changes in our payer mix (i.e., shifts in the relative
distribution of our pharmacy customers across drug insurance plans and programs toward plans and
programs with less favorable reimbursement terms); changes in third-party payer drug formularies
(i.e., the schedule of prescription drugs approved for reimbursement or which otherwise receive
preferential coverage treatment); growth in, and our participation in or exclusion from, pharmacy
payer network arrangements including exclusive and preferred pharmacy network arrangements operated
by PBMs and/or any insurance plan or program; increases in the prices we pay for brand name and
generic prescription drugs we sell; increases in the administrative burdens associated with seeking
third-party reimbursement; changes in the frequency with which new brand name pharmaceuticals become
available to consumers; introduction of lower cost generic drugs as substitutes for existing brand
name drugs for which there was no prior generic drug competition; changes in drug mix (i.e., the
relative distribution of drugs customers purchase at our pharmacies between brands and generics);
changes in the health insurance market generally; changes in the scope of or the elimination of
Medicare Part D or Medicaid drug programs; increased competition from other retail pharmacy
operations including competitors offering online retail pharmacy options with or without home
delivery options; further consolidation and strategic alliances among third-party payers, PBMs or
purchasers of drugs; overall economic conditions and the ability of our pharmacy customers to pay for
drugs prescribed for them to the extent the costs are not reimbursed by a third-party; failure to
meet any performance or incentive thresholds to which our level of third-party reimbursement may be
subject; changes in laws or regulations or the practices of third-party payers and PBMs related to
the use of third-party financial assistance to assist our pharmacy customers with paying for drugs
prescribed for them; and any additional changes in the regulatory environment for the retail pharmacy
industry and the pharmaceutical industry, including as a result of restrictions on the further
implementation of or the repeal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or the enactment
and implementation of a law replacing such act, and other changes in laws, rules and regulations that
affect our retail pharmacy business.
If the supply of certain pharmaceuticals provided by one or more of our vendors were to be disrupted
for any reason, our pharmacy operations could be severely affected until at least such time as we
could obtain a new supplier for such pharmaceuticals. Any such disruption could cause reputational
damage and result in a significant number of our pharmacy customers transferring their prescriptions
to other pharmacies.
One or a combination of such factors may adversely affect the volumes of brand name and generic
pharmaceuticals we sell, our cost of sales associated with our retail pharmacy operations, and the
net sales and gross margin of those operations or result in the loss of cross-store or cross-club
selling opportunities and, in turn, adversely affect our overall net sales, other results of
operations, cash flows and liquidity.
Our failure to attract and retain qualified associates, increases in wage and benefit costs, changes
in laws and other labor issues could materially adversely affect our financial performance.
Our ability to continue to conduct and expand our operations depends on our ability to attract and
retain a large and growing number of qualified associates globally. Our ability to meet our labor
needs, including our ability to find qualified personnel to fill positions that become vacant at our
existing stores, clubs, distribution and fulfillment centers and corporate offices, while controlling
our associate wage and related labor costs, is generally subject to numerous external factors,
including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force of the
markets in which we operate, unemployment levels within those markets, prevailing wage rates,
changing demographics, health and other insurance costs and adoption of new or revised employment and
labor laws and regulations. Additionally, our ability to successfully execute organizational changes,
including management transitions within the Company's senior leadership, and to effectively motivate
and retain associates are critical to our business success. If we are unable to locate, attract or
retain qualified personnel, or manage leadership transition successfully, the quality of service we
provide to our customers may decrease and our financial performance may be adversely affected.
In addition, if our costs of labor or related costs increase for other reasons or if new or revised
labor laws, rules or regulations or healthcare laws are adopted or implemented that further increase
our labor costs, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected.
 20 
 Financial Risks 
Failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance could adversely affect the market
price and volatility of our stock.
We believe that the price of our stock generally reflects high market expectations for our future
operating results. Any failure to meet or delay in meeting these expectations, including our
comparable store and club sales growth rates, eCommerce growth rates, gross margin, or earnings and
adjusted earnings per share could cause the market price of our stock to decline, as could changes in
our dividend or stock repurchase programs or policies, changes in our financial estimates and
recommendations by securities analysts or, failure of Walmart's performance to compare favorably to
that of other retailers may have a negative effect on the price of our stock.
Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may materially adversely affect our financial performance and
our reported results of operations.
Our operations in countries other than the U.S. are conducted primarily in the local currencies of
those countries. Our Consolidated Financial Statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, and to
prepare those financial statements we must translate the amounts of the assets, liabilities, net
sales, other revenues and expenses of our operations outside of the U.S. from local currencies into
U.S. dollars using exchange rates for the current period. In recent years, fluctuations in currency
exchange rates that were unfavorable have had adverse effects on our reported results of operations.
As a result of such translations, fluctuations in currency exchange rates from period-to-period that
are unfavorable to us may also result in our Consolidated Financial Statements reflecting significant
adverse period-over-period changes in our financial performance or reflecting a period-over-period
improvement in our financial performance that is not as robust as it would be without such
fluctuations in the currency exchange rates. Such unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations
will adversely affect the reported performance of our Walmart International operating segment and
have a corresponding adverse effect on our reported consolidated results of operations.
We may pay for products we purchase for sale in our stores and clubs around the world with a currency
other than the local currency of the country in which the goods will be sold. When we must acquire
the currency to pay for such products and the exchange rates for the payment currency fluctuate in a
manner unfavorable to us, our cost of sales may increase and we may be unable or unwilling to change
the prices at which we sell those goods to address that increase in our costs, with a corresponding
adverse effect on our gross profit. Consequently, unfavorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates
have and may continue to adversely affect our results of operations.
Legal, Tax, Regulatory, Compliance, Reputational and Other Risks
Our international operations subject us to legislative, judicial, accounting, legal, regulatory, tax,
political and economic risks and conditions specific to the countries or regions in which we operate,
which could materially adversely affect our business or financial performance.
In addition to our U.S. operations, we operate our retail business in Africa, Canada, Central
America, Chile, China, India and Mexico.
During fiscal 2021, our Walmart International operations generated approximately 22% of our
consolidated net sales. Walmart International's operations in various countries also source goods and
services from other countries. Our future operating results in these countries could be negatively
affected by a variety of factors, most of which are beyond our control. These factors include
political conditions, including political instability, local and global economic conditions, legal
and regulatory constraints (such as regulation of product and service offerings including regulatory
restrictions (such as foreign ownership restrictions) on eCommerce and retail operations in
international markets, such as India), restrictive governmental actions (such as trade protection
measures), antitrust and competition law regulatory matters (such as the competition investigations
currently underway in Mexico related to our subsidiary Wal-Mart de Mexico, in Canada related to our
subsidiary Wal-Mart Canada and competition proceedings in India related to our Flipkart subsidiary),
local product safety and environmental laws, tax regulations, local labor laws, anti-money laundering
laws and regulations, trade policies, currency regulations, laws and regulations regarding consumer
and data protection, and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate, now or
in the future.
 21 
The economies of some of the countries in which we have operations have in the past suffered from
high rates of inflation and currency devaluations, which, if they occurred again, could adversely
affect our financial performance. Other factors which may impact our international operations include
foreign trade, monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. and of other countries, laws, regulations and
other activities of foreign governments, agencies and similar organizations, and risks associated
with having numerous facilities located in countries that have historically been less stable than the
U.S. Additional risks inherent in our international operations generally include, among others, the
costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences and greater
difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights in countries other than the U.S. The various
risks inherent in doing business in the U.S. generally also exist when doing business outside of the
U.S., and may be exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions
due to differences in culture, laws and regulations.
In foreign countries in which we have operations, a risk exists that our associates, contractors or
agents could, in contravention of our policies, engage in business practices prohibited by U.S. laws
and regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or the laws and
regulations of other countries. We maintain a global policy prohibiting such business practices and
have in place a global anti-corruption compliance program designed to ensure compliance with these
laws and regulations. Nevertheless, we remain subject to the risk that one or more of our associates,
contractors or agents, including those based in or from countries where practices that violate such
U.S. laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries may be customary, will
engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies, circumvent our compliance programs
and, by doing so, violate such laws and regulations. Any such violations, even if prohibited by our
internal policies, could adversely affect our business or financial performance and our reputation.
Changes in tax and trade laws and regulations could materially adversely affect our financial
performance.
In fiscal 2021, our Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club operating segments generated approximately 78% of our
consolidated net sales. Significant changes in tax and trade policies, including tariffs and
government regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries where we source many of
the products we sell in our stores and clubs could have an adverse effect on our financial
performance. A significant portion of the general merchandise we sell in our U.S. stores and clubs is
manufactured in other countries. Any such actions including the imposition of further tariffs on
imports could increase the cost to us of such merchandise (whether imported directly or indirectly)
and cause increases in the prices at which we sell such merchandise to our customers, which could
materially adversely affect the financial performance of our U.S. operations and our business.
We are subject to income taxes and other taxes in both the U.S. and the foreign jurisdictions in
which we currently operate or have historically operated. The determination of our worldwide
provision for income taxes and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities requires judgment and
estimation. Our income taxes could be materially adversely affected by earnings being lower than
anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in
jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax
assets and liabilities, or by changes in worldwide tax laws, tax rates, regulations or accounting
principles.
We are also exposed to future tax legislation, as well as the issuance of future regulations and
changes in administrative interpretations of existing tax laws, any of which can impact our current
and future years' tax provision. The effect of such changes in tax law could have a material effect
on our business, financial position and results of operations. In the U.S., the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
of 2017 (the "Tax Act") significantly changed federal income tax laws that affect U.S. corporations
and additional guidance from the U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies
is still pending. As further guidance is issued by these taxing authorities, any resulting changes in
our estimates will be treated in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance. Compliance with
the Tax Act, including collecting information not regularly produced by the Company or unexpected
changes in our estimates, may require us to incur additional costs and could affect our results of
operations.
In addition, in response to significant market volatility and disruptions to business operations
resulting from the global spread of COVID-19, legislatures and taxing authorities in many
jurisdictions in which we operate may enact changes to their tax rules. These changes could include
modifications that have temporary effect and more permanent changes. The impact of these potential
new rules as well as any other changes in domestic and international tax rules and regulations could
have a material effect on our effective tax rate.
Furthermore, we are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities
as well as subject to the prospective and retrospective effects of changing tax regulations and
legislation. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may
materially differ from the tax amounts recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements and may
materially affect our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period or periods for
which such determination and settlement is made.
 22 
Changes in and/or failure to comply with other laws and regulations specific to the environments in
which we operate could materially adversely affect our reputation, market position, or our business
and financial performance.
We operate in complex regulated environments in the U.S. and in the other countries in which we
operate and could be adversely affected by changes to existing legal requirements including the
related interpretations and enforcement practices, new legal requirements and/or any failure to
comply with applicable regulations.
Our operations in the U.S. are subject to numerous federal, state and local regulations including
licensing and other requirements and reimbursement arrangements affecting our health and wellness
operations. The regulations to which we are subject include, but are not limited to: federal and
state registration and regulation of pharmacies; dispensing and sale of controlled substances and
products containing pseudoephedrine; applicable governmental payer regulations including Medicare and
Medicaid; data privacy and security laws and regulations including the Health Insurance Portability
and Accountability Act, the Affordable Care Act, laws and regulations relating to the protection of
the environment and health and safety matters, including those governing exposure to, and the
management and disposal of, hazardous substances; regulations regarding food and drug safety
including those of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the "FDA") and the Drug Enforcement
Administration (the "DEA"), trade regulations including those of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission,
and consumer protection and safety regulations including those of the Consumer Product Safety
Commission, as well as state regulatory authorities, governing the availability, sale, advertisement
and promotion of products we sell and the financial services we offer; anti-kickback laws; false
claims laws; patient inducement regulations; and federal and state laws governing health care fraud
and abuse and the practice of the professions of pharmacy, optical care and health care services.
For example, in the U.S., the DEA and various other regulatory authorities regulate the distribution
and dispensing of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances. We are required to hold valid DEA and
state-level licenses, meet various security and operating standards and comply with the federal and
various state controlled substance acts and related regulations governing the sale, dispensing,
disposal and holding of controlled substances. The DEA, the FDA and state regulatory authorities have
broad enforcement powers, including the ability to seize or recall products and impose significant
criminal, civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations.
We are also governed by foreign, national and state laws and regulations of general applicability,
including laws and regulations related to working conditions, health and safety, equal employment
opportunity, employee benefit and other labor and employment matters, laws and regulations related to
competition and antitrust matters, and health and wellness related regulations for our pharmacy
operations outside of the U.S. In addition, certain financial services we offer or make available,
such as our money transfer agent services, are subject to legal and regulatory requirements,
including those intended to help detect and prevent money laundering, sanctions, fraud and other
illicit activity as well as consumer financial protection. We are also subject to data privacy and
protection laws regulating the collection, use, retention, disclosure, transfer and processing of
personal information, such as the California Consumer Protection Act (“CCPA”), which was recently
significantly modified by the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), as well as the European Union’s
General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). The potential effects of these laws are far-reaching and
may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs
and expenses to comply. In the case of non-compliance with a material provision of the GDPR (such as
non-adherence to the core principles of processing personal data), regulators have the authority to
levy a fine in an amount that is up to the greater of €20 million or 4% of global annual turnover in
the prior year. These administrative fines are discretionary and based, in each case, on a multi-
factored approach. The CCPA and CPRA give California residents expanded rights to access, correct and
require deletion of their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing and
receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA and CPRA provide
for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches.
Furthermore, our marketing and customer engagement activities are subject to communications privacy
laws such as the Telephone Consumer Protection Act. We may be subjected to penalties and other
consequences for noncompliance, including changing some portions of our business. Even an
unsuccessful challenge by customer or regulatory authorities of our activities could result in
adverse publicity and could require a costly response from and defense by us.
The impact of new laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations, as well as changes
in enforcement practices or regulatory scrutiny generally cannot be predicted, and changes in
applicable laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices
may require extensive system and operational changes, be difficult to implement, increase our
operating costs, require significant capital expenditures, or adversely impact the cost or
attractiveness of the products or services we offer, or result in adverse publicity and harm our
reputation.
 23 
While we strive to adhere our practices and procedures to these laws, they are subject to evolving
regulations, interpretations and regulator discretion. To the extent a regulator or court disagrees
with our interpretation of these laws and determines that our practices are not in compliance with
applicable laws and regulations, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties that could
adversely affect the continued operation of our businesses, including: suspension of payments from
government programs; loss of required government certifications; loss of authorizations to
participate in or exclusion from government programs, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs in
the U.S.; loss of licenses; termination from contractual relationships, including those with our drug
suppliers and third-party payers; and significant fines or monetary damages and/or penalties. In
addition, failure to comply with applicable legal or regulatory requirements in the U.S. or in any of
the countries in which we operate could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to
our reputation, and have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial position and
results of operations.
We are subject to risks related to litigation and other legal proceedings that may materially
adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and liquidity.
We operate in a highly regulated and litigious environment. We are involved in legal proceedings,
including litigation, arbitration and other claims, and investigations, inspections, audits, claims,
inquiries and similar actions by pharmacy, healthcare, tax, environmental and other governmental
authorities. We may also have indemnification obligations for legal commitments of certain businesses
we have divested. Legal proceedings, in general, and securities, derivative action and class action
and multi-district litigation, in particular, can be expensive and disruptive. Some of these suits
may purport or may be determined to be class actions and/or involve parties seeking large and/or
indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages, and may remain unresolved for several
years. For example, we are currently a defendant in a number of cases containing class or collective-
action allegations, or both, in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state wage
and hour laws, as well as a number of cases containing class-action allegations in which the
plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state consumer laws.
The Company has also been responding to subpoenas, information requests and investigations from
governmental entities related to nationwide controlled substance dispensing and distribution
practices involving opioids and is also a defendant in numerous litigation proceedings related to
opioids including the consolidated multidistrict litigation entitled In re National Prescription
Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) , currently pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern
District of Ohio. Similar cases that name the Company have also been filed in state courts by state,
local and tribal governments, health care providers and other plaintiffs. Plaintiffs are seeking
compensatory and punitive damages, as well as injunctive relief including abatement. On October 22,
2020, the Company filed a declaratory judgment action in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern
District of Texas against the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) and the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration, asking a federal court to clarify the roles and responsibilities of pharmacists and
pharmacies as to the dispensing and distribution of opioids under the Controlled Substances Act (the
“CSA”). The Company’s action was dismissed and the Company is appealing the decision. On December 22,
2020, the DOJ filed a civil complaint against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the District
of Delaware alleging that the Company unlawfully dispensed controlled substances from its pharmacies
and unlawfully distributed controlled substances to those pharmacies in violation of the CSA. The DOJ
is seeking civil penalties and injunctive relief. The Company filed a motion to dismiss the DOJ
complaint on February 22, 2021. In addition, the Company is the subject of two securities class
actions alleging violations of the federal securities laws regarding the Company’s disclosures with
respect to opioids filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware on January 20, 2021
and March 5, 2021 purportedly on behalf of a class of investors who acquired Walmart stock from March
30, 2016 through December 22, 2020. A derivative action was also filed by one of the Company's
shareholders in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware on February 9, 2021 alleging
breach of fiduciary duties against certain of its current and former directors with respect to
oversight of the Company’s distribution and dispensing of opioids.
The Company cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, and cannot reasonably
estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from such claims and the related opioid matters.
We discuss these cases and other litigation to which we are party below under the caption " Item 3.
Legal Proceedings " and in Note 10 in the " Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements ," which
are part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 24 
Our amended and restated bylaws designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole
and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our
shareholders, which could increase the costs for our shareholders to bring claims, discourage our
shareholders from bringing claims, or limit our shareholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial
forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, associates or shareholders in such capacity.
Our bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole
and exclusive forum for claims, including derivative claims that are based upon a violation of a duty
by a current or former director, officer, associate or shareholder in such capacity or as to which
the Delaware General Corporation Law confers jurisdiction upon the Court of Chancery. The exclusive
forum provision may increase the costs for a shareholder to bring a claim or limit a shareholder’s
ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that the shareholder finds favorable for disputes with
us or our directors, officers, associates or shareholders in such capacity, which may discourage such
lawsuits against us and such persons. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our
bylaws inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, the claims as to which they are intended to
apply, then we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other
jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial position or results of
operations. While the exclusive forum provision applies to state and federal law claims, our
shareholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with, and the exclusive forum provision
will not preclude or contract the scope of exclusive federal or concurrent jurisdiction for actions
brought under, the federal securities laws, including the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, or the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder.

(the "MDL"). The MDL is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio and
includes over 2,000 cases as of March 5, 2021, some of which cases are in the process of being
transferred to the MDL. A trial previously scheduled to begin on May 10, 2021 against a number of

some of which may be removed to federal court to seek MDL transfer. The case citations for the state

DOJ Opioid Litigation: On October 22, 2020, the Company filed a declaratory judgment action in the
Eastern District of Texas against the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) and the U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration, asking a federal court to clarify the roles and responsibilities of
pharmacists and pharmacies as to the dispensing and distribution of opioids under the Controlled
Substances Act (the “CSA”) . The Company’s action, Walmart Inc. v. U.S. Department of Justice et al.,
USDC, Eastern Dist. of Texas, 10/22/20, was dismissed and the Company is appealing the decision. A
civil complaint pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware has been filed by the
DOJ against the Company, in which the DOJ alleges violations of the CSA related to nationwide
distribution and dispensing of opioids. U.S. v. Walmart Inc., et al ., USDC, Dist. of DE, 12/22/20.
The Company filed a motion to dismiss the DOJ complaint on February 22, 2021.

action lawsuits drawing heavily on the allegations of the DOJ complaint have been filed in Delaware
naming various current and former directors and certain officers as defendants. The plaintiff in the
derivative suit (in which the Company is a nominal defendant) alleges, among other things, that the
defendants breached their fiduciary duties in connection with their oversight of opioids dispensing
and distribution. The securities class actions, alleging violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended regarding the Company’s disclosures with respect to
opioids were purportedly filed on behalf of a class of investors who acquired Walmart stock from
March 30, 2016 through December 22, 2020 .

Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of Pennsylvania seeking documents regarding the Company’s
consumer fraud program and anti-money laundering compliance related to the Company’s money transfer
services, where Walmart is an agent. The most recent subpoena was issued in August 2020. The Company
has been responding to these subpoenas and is cooperating with the government’s investigation. The
Company has also responded to civil investigative demands from the United States Federal Trade
Commission (the “FTC”) and is cooperating with the FTC’s investigation related to money transfers and
the Company’s anti-fraud program in its capacity as an agent. The Company is unable to predict the
outcome of the investigations or any related actions by the governmental entities regarding these
matters at this time. While the Company does not currently believe that the outcome of these matters
will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position, results of operations or
cash flows, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of these matters and
whether its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially
adversely affected.
III. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS: Item 103 of SEC Regulation S-K requires disclosure of certain
environmental matters when a governmental authority is a party to the proceedings and such
proceedings involve potential monetary sanctions that the Company reasonably believes will exceed an

matters to disclose for this period.
