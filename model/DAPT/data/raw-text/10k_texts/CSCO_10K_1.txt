Item 1. Business 
 General 
Cisco designs and sells a broad range of technologies that help to power, secure, and draw insights
from the Internet. We are integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into our product portfolios across
networking, security, collaboration and observability to simplify how our technology is delivered,
managed and optimized and to help customers maximize the business value of their technology
investments and accelerate their digital transformation.
We conduct our business globally and manage our business by geography. Our business is organized into
the following three geographic segments: Americas; Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA); and Asia
Pacific, Japan, and China (APJC).
Our products and technologies are grouped into the following categories: Networking, Security,
Collaboration and Observability. In addition to our product offerings, we provide a broad range of
services offerings, including technical support services and advanced services, also known as
lifecycle services. Our customers include businesses of all sizes, public institutions, governments,
and service providers, including large webscale providers. These customers often look to us as a
strategic partner to help them use information technology (IT) to differentiate themselves and drive
positive business outcomes.
We were incorporated in California in 1984 and reincorporated in Delaware in 2021. Our headquarters

 Strategy and Priorities 
Across the globe, businesses and organizations of every size are leveraging Cisco technology to
transform and drive better outcomes and experiences. We also help customers navigate emerging
technological shifts. Our strategy is to securely connect everything to make those desired outcomes
and experiences possible for our customers.
In today’s dynamic environment, our customers have three key priorities: build modern and resilient
infrastructure; protect against the cyber threats of today and tomorrow; and harness the power of AI
and data.
These customer priorities are central to how we innovate and develop our technology. First, we
provide the underlying network connectivity for our customers, whether they are connecting
traditional branch offices, data centers, smart grids, video devices, electric vehicles, or other
devices. Second, we help protect those network connections and the underlying technology architecture
against cyber threats. Third, through the visibility we have into data across the network, connected
devices and applications, we provide context and insights to our customers about what is happening in
their technology architecture, not only in their on-premise infrastructure and private data centers,
but also their cloud infrastructure. Our ongoing innovation is delivered, managed and optimized
through a combination of hardware, software and subscriptions, in line with the flexible consumption
models our customers request.

Cisco can help customers connect, protect and draw actionable insights from their technology. We do
this in service of delivering the digital resilience our customers need for today’s complex and
unpredictable world.
 Customer Priorities 
Modernize Infrastructure
In an increasingly digital and connected world, where each new connection to the Internet puts more
demand on the network, our customers are looking to modernize and transform their infrastructure,
including through automation to manage and monitor each connection in real time.
We continue to transform our enterprise networking portfolio by bringing together several
technologies to form an integrated architecture. Our vision is to build a unified management platform
experience for on-premise and cloud operating models, that simplifies and helps secure networking for
customers at scale.
Our Observability offerings collect and process daily measurements from customers’ owned and unowned
networks, providing automated insights, proactive recommendations, and closed-loop operations
tailored to customers to enable them to reduce mean time to resolution of issues and improve IT
productivity and user experience.
For the data center, our strategy is to deliver multicloud architectures that bring policy and
operational consistency, regardless of where applications or data reside. We continue to make
significant investments in the development of software, silicon and optics, which we believe are the
building blocks for the internet for the future.
As part of modernizing their infrastructure, customers of every size are also looking for solutions
to help them communicate more effectively with their customers and to connect their employees more
efficiently for productivity. Our collaboration portfolio, which includes interoperable devices and
our cloud contact center, provides those solutions, and serves as a key component of smart buildings,
powered over ethernet, that we believe will define the workplaces of the future.
Improve Cybersecurity
With the rapid growth in modern applications, hyper-distributed architecture and increasingly
sophisticated cyberattacks, customers see cybersecurity as a top priority. Our differentiated
security strategy is based on three pillars: moving from point solutions to a platform
comprehensively integrated with the infrastructure; infusing security into the fabric of the network;
and harnessing the depth and breadth of telemetry data from Cisco and with our acquisition of Splunk
Inc. (“Splunk”) to prevent, detect, and respond to sophisticated attacks.
Harness the Power of AI and Data
AI represents a generational shift in technology and is driving an order of magnitude higher
requirement for network connectivity. We provide network infrastructure to power AI training and
inference workloads for both webscalers and enterprises. We help to scale our customers’ network
infrastructure with high-density routers and switches, improved network management, and high-
performance optics. We are reinventing data center operations for our customers by simplifying the
configuration, monitoring, and maintenance of fabrics, compute, networking and storage.
We can help give customers visibility across the network, security solutions, applications and their
own business data. With this breadth and scale of data, we can help deliver differentiated insights
and context to customers, leading them to more informed proactive decisions and better business
results.
For a discussion of the risks associated with our Strategy and Priorities, see “Item 1A. Risk
Factors,” including the risk factor entitled “We depend upon the development of new products and
services, and enhancements to existing products and services, and if we fail to predict and respond
to emerging technological trends and customers’ changing needs, our operating results and market
share may suffer.” For information regarding sales of our major products and services, see Note 19 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements.

communications platform that integrates communication channels and existing back-end business systems
together to help enable the orchestration and automation of all customer and employee interactions.
 Observability 
Observability consists of our network assurance, monitoring and analytics and observability suite
offerings. Our Observability offerings are designed to bring together and provide end-to-end
visibility of our customer’s environments across applications, networks, multi-cloud infrastructures
and the Internet, to help deliver full stack observability for modern environments and drive relevant
real-time insights. These offerings enable organizations to see, understand, and improve every
digital experience and assure seamless connectivity for their modern digital environments. Our
network assurance offering, ThousandEyes, is a network intelligence platform that provides in-depth
visibility into network and internet performance. Our Observability Suite offering, including Splunk
Observability and AppDynamics, provides complete visibility across the full stack from infrastructure
to applications as well as the digital customer experience.
 Services 
In addition to our product offerings, we provide a broad range of service and support options for our
customers. Our support and maintenance services help our customers ensure their products operate
efficiently, remain available, and benefit from the most up-to-date system and application software.
These services help customers protect their network investments, manage risk, and minimize downtime
for systems running mission-critical applications.
We also provide comprehensive advisory services that are focused on responsive, preventive, and
consultative support of our technologies for specific networking needs. We are investing in and
expanding advisory services in the areas of software, cloud, security, and analytics, which reflects
our strategy of selling customer outcomes. We are focused on three priorities: utilizing technology
advisory services to drive higher product and services; assessment and migration services providing
the tools, expertise and methodologies to enable our customers to migrate to new technology
platforms; and providing optimization services aligned with customers’ business expectations. We are
also embedding AI assistants and automated functions into our services to drive productivity.
 Customers and Markets 
Many factors influence the IT, collaboration, and networking requirements of our customers. These
include the size of the organization, number and types of technology systems, geographic location,
and business applications deployed throughout the customer’s network. Our customer base is not
limited to any specific industry, geography, or market segment. Our customers primarily operate in
the following markets: enterprise, public sector and service provider and cloud.
 Enterprise 
Enterprise includes businesses that are large regional, national, or global organizations with
multiple locations or branch offices, or mid-market and small businesses. Many enterprise businesses
have unique IT, collaboration, and networking needs within a multi-vendor environment. Our mid-market
and small business customers typically require the latest advanced technologies, but with less
complexity. We offer service and support packages, financing, and managed network services, primarily
through our service provider partners. We sell these products through a network of third-party
application and technology vendors and channel partners, as well as selling directly to these
customers.
 Public Sector 
Public Sector includes federal, state and local governments, as well as educational institution
customers. Many public sector customers have unique IT, collaboration, and networking needs within a
multi-vendor environment. We sell to public sector customers through a network of third-party
application and technology vendors and channel partners, as well as through direct sales.
 Service Provider and Cloud 
Service Provider and Cloud includes regional, national, and international wireline carriers and
webscale operators, as well as internet, cable, and wireless providers. We also include media,
broadcast, and content providers within this customer market, as the lines in the telecommunications
industry continue to blur between traditional network-based, content-based and application-based
services. This customer market offers data, voice, video, and mobile/wireless services to businesses,
governments, utilities, and consumers worldwide. Service provider and cloud businesses use a variety
of our products and services for their own networks. In addition, many service providers use Cisco
data center, virtualization, and collaboration technologies to offer managed or internet-based
services to their business customers. Compared with other customers, service providers are more
likely to require network design, deployment, and support services because of the greater scale and
higher complexity of their networks, whose requirements are addressed, we believe, by our
architectural approach.

 Sales Overview 
As of the end of fiscal 2024, our worldwide sales and marketing functions consisted of approximately
28,000 employees, including managers, sales representatives, and technical support personnel. We sell
our products and services both directly and indirectly through a variety of channels with support
from our sales workforce. A substantial portion of our products and services is sold indirectly
through channel partners, and the remainder is sold through direct sales. Channel partners include
systems integrators, service providers, other third-party resellers, and distributors.
Systems integrators and service providers typically sell directly to end users and often provide
system installation, technical support, professional services, and other support services in addition
to network equipment sales. Systems integrators also typically integrate our products into an overall
solution. Some service providers are also systems integrators.
Distributors may hold inventory and sell to systems integrators, service providers, and other third-
party resellers. We refer to sales through distributors as our two-tier system of sales to the end
customer. Revenue from two-tier distributors is recognized based on a sell-in method. These
distributors may be given business terms that allow them to return a limited portion of inventory,
receive credits for changes in selling prices, receive certain rebates, and participate in various
cooperative marketing programs.
Our service offerings complement our products through a range of consulting, technical, project,
quality, and software maintenance services, including 24-hour online and telephone support through
technical assistance centers.
For information regarding risks related to our sales channels, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” including
the risk factors entitled “Disruption of or changes in our distribution model could harm our sales
and margins” and “Inventory management relating to our sales to our two-tier distribution channel is
complex, and excess inventory may harm our gross margins.”
For information regarding risks relating to our international operations, see “Item 1A. Risk
Factors,” including the risk factors entitled “Our operating results may be negatively impacted by
unfavorable economic and market conditions and the uncertain geopolitical environment;” “Entrance
into new or developing markets exposes us to additional competition and will likely increase demands
on our service and support operations;” “Due to the global nature of our operations, political or
economic changes or other factors in a specific country or region could harm our operating results
and financial condition;” “We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could
negatively impact our financial results and cash flows;” and “Cyber attacks, data breaches or other
incidents impacting our solutions and IT environment may disrupt our operations, harm our operating
results and financial condition, and damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business;
and cyber attacks, data breaches or other incidents on our customers’ or third-party providers’
networks, or in third-party products we use, could result in claims of liability against us, give
rise to legal and/or regulatory action, damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm our
business,” among others.
 Financing Arrangements 
We provide financing arrangements for certain qualified customers to build, maintain, and upgrade
their networks. We believe customer financing is a competitive advantage in obtaining business,
particularly for those customers involved in significant infrastructure projects. Our financing
arrangements include loans, leases (sales-type, direct financing and operating) and channel financing
arrangements.
 Acquisitions, Investments, and Alliances 
The markets in which we compete require a wide variety of technologies, products, and capabilities.
We continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire and invest in businesses and technologies that
complement and enable further investment in our key priority areas.
 Acquisitions 
We acquire companies in order to gain access to talent, technology, products and features,
operational capabilities or new markets. The risks associated with acquisitions are more fully
discussed in “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” including the risk factor entitled “We have made and expect to
continue to make acquisitions that could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results.”
 Investments in Privately Held Companies 
We make investments in privately held companies that develop technology or provide services that are
complementary to our products or that provide insights into emerging technologies that may become
relevant to our businesses. The risks associated with these investments are more fully discussed in
“Item 1A. Risk Factors,” including the risk factor entitled “We are exposed to fluctuations in the
market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates; impairment of our investments could
harm our earnings.”

Table of Contents
 Strategic Alliances 
We pursue strategic alliances with other companies in areas where collaboration can produce industry
advancement and accelerate new markets. The objectives and goals of a strategic alliance can include
one or more of the following: technology exchange, product development, joint sales and marketing, or
new market creation.
The risks associated with our strategic alliances are more fully discussed in “Item 1A. Risk
Factors,” including the risk factor entitled “If we do not successfully manage our strategic
alliances, we may not realize the expected benefits from such alliances and we may experience
increased competition or delays in product development.”
 Competition 
We compete in the networking and communications equipment markets, providing products and services
designed to transport, and help secure data, voice, and video traffic across cloud, private and
public networks and the Internet. We compete with numerous vendors in each product category. The
overall number of our competitors providing niche product solutions may increase. Also, the identity
and composition of competitors may change as we increase our activity in newer product areas, and in
key priority areas. As we continue to expand globally, we may see new competition in different
geographic regions. In particular, we have experienced price-focused competition from competitors in
Asia, especially from China, and we anticipate this will continue.
Our competitors (in each case relative to only some of our products or services) include: Amazon Web
Services LLC; Arista Networks, Inc.; Broadcom Inc.; Ciena Corporation; CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.;
Datadog Inc.; Dell Technologies Inc.; Dynatrace Inc.; Fortinet, Inc.; Hewlett-Packard Enterprise
Company; Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd.; Juniper Networks, Inc.; Microsoft Corporation; New Relic,
Inc.; Nokia Corporation; Nvidia Corporation; Palo Alto Networks, Inc.; RingCentral, Inc.; Zoom Video
Communications, Inc.; and Zscaler, Inc.; among others.
Some of our competitors compete across many of our product lines, while others are primarily focused
in a specific product area. Barriers to entry are relatively low, and new ventures to create products
that do or could compete with our products are regularly formed. In addition, some of our competitors
may have greater resources, including technical and engineering resources, than we do. As we expand
into new markets, we will face competition not only from our existing competitors but also from other
competitors, including existing companies with strong technological, marketing, and sales positions
in those markets. We also sometimes face competition from resellers and distributors of our products.
Companies with which we have strategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas, and
this trend may increase. For example, the enterprise data center is undergoing a fundamental
transformation arising from the convergence of technologies, including computing, networking,
storage, and software, that previously were segregated. Additionally, companies that are strategic
alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors,
thereby reducing their business with us.
The principal competitive factors in the markets in which we presently compete and may compete in the
future include the ability to sell successful business outcomes; the ability to provide a broad range
of networking and communications products and services; product performance; price; the ability to
introduce new products, including providing continuous new customer value and products with price-
performance advantages; the ability to reduce production costs; the ability to provide value-added
features such as security, reliability, and investment protection; conformance to standards; market
presence; the ability to provide financing; and disruptive technology shifts and new business models.
We also face competition from customers to which we license or supply technology and suppliers from
which we transfer technology. The inherent nature of networking requires interoperability. As such,
we must cooperate and, at the same time, compete with many companies. Any inability to effectively
manage these complicated relationships with customers, suppliers, and strategic alliance partners
could materially harm our business, operating results, and financial condition and accordingly affect
our chances of success.
 Research and Development 
We regularly introduce new products and features to address the requirements of our markets. We
allocate our research and development budget among our product categories, which consist of
Networking, Security, Collaboration, and Observability technologies. Our research and development
expenditures are applied generally to all product areas, with specific areas of focus being
identified from time to time. Our expenditures for research and development costs were expensed as
incurred.
The industry in which we compete is subject to rapid technological developments, evolving standards,
changes in customer requirements, and new product introductions and enhancements. As a result, our
success depends, in part, on our ability, on a cost-effective and timely basis, to continue to
enhance our existing products and to develop and introduce new products that improve performance and
reduce total cost of ownership. To achieve these objectives, our management and engineering personnel
work with customers to identify and respond to customer needs, as well as with other innovators of
internet networking products, including universities, laboratories, and corporations. We also expect
to continue to make acquisitions and
 6 
Table of Contents
strategic investments, where appropriate, to provide us with access to new technologies. Nonetheless,
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop products to address new
customer requirements and technological changes or that those products will achieve market
acceptance.
 Manufacturing 
We rely on contract manufacturers for our manufacturing needs. We presently use a variety of
independent third-party companies to provide services related to printed-circuit board assembly, in-
circuit test, product repair, and product assembly. Proprietary software in electronically
programmable memory chips is used to configure products that meet customer requirements and to
maintain quality control and security. The manufacturing process enables us to configure the hardware
and software in unique combinations to meet a wide variety of individual customer requirements. The
manufacturing process also uses automated testing equipment and burn-in procedures, as well as
comprehensive inspection, testing, and statistical process controls, which are designed to help
ensure the quality and reliability of our products. The manufacturing processes and procedures are
generally certified to International Organization for Standardization 9001 standards.
Our arrangements with contract manufacturers generally provide for quality, cost, and delivery
requirements, as well as manufacturing process terms, such as inventory management; flexibility
regarding capacity, quality, and cost management; oversight of manufacturing; and conditions for use
of our intellectual property. We have not entered into any significant long-term contracts with any
contract manufacturers. We generally have the option to renew arrangements on an as-needed basis.
These arrangements with contract manufacturers generally do not commit us to purchase any particular
amount or any quantities beyond amounts covered by orders or forecasts that we submit covering
discrete periods of time.
 Patents, Intellectual Property, and Licensing 
We seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products through the
use of patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secret laws. We have a program to file applications
for and obtain patents, copyrights, and trademarks in the United States and in selected foreign
countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate. We also seek to maintain our
trade secrets and confidential information by nondisclosure policies and through the use of
appropriate confidentiality agreements. We have obtained a substantial number of patents and
trademarks in the United States and in other countries. There can be no assurance, however, that the
rights obtained can be successfully enforced against infringing products in every jurisdiction.
Although we believe the protection afforded by our patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets
has value, the rapidly changing technology in the networking industry and uncertainties in the legal
process make our future success dependent primarily on the innovative skills, technological
expertise, and management abilities of our employees rather than on the protection afforded by
patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws.
Many of our products are designed to include software or other intellectual property licensed from
third parties. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various
aspects of our products, we believe, based upon past experience and standard industry practice, that
such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. Nonetheless, there can be
no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Our
inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on
favorable terms, or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters, could materially harm
our business, operating results, and financial condition. Moreover, inclusion in our products of
software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis can limit
our ability to protect our proprietary rights in our products.
The industry in which we compete is characterized by rapidly changing technology, a large number of
patents, and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property
rights. There can be no assurance that our patents and other proprietary rights will not be
challenged, invalidated, or circumvented; that others will not assert intellectual property rights to
technologies that are relevant to us; or that our rights will give us a competitive advantage. In
addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same
extent as the laws of the United States. The risks associated with patents and intellectual property
are more fully discussed in “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” including the risk factors entitled “Our
proprietary rights may prove difficult to enforce,” “We may be found to infringe on intellectual
property rights of others,” and “We rely on the availability of third-party licenses.”
 Government Regulation 
We are subject to numerous regulations and laws in the United States and abroad that involve matters
central to our business. Many of these regulations and laws are evolving and their applicability and
scope, as interpreted by courts and regulators, remain uncertain. These regulations and laws involve
a variety of matters including privacy, data protection and personal information, cybersecurity,
operational resilience, artificial intelligence, tax, trade, encryption technology, environmental
sustainability (including climate change), human rights, product certification, and national
security.

A failure, or alleged failure, by us to comply with regulations or laws could materially harm our
business, operating results, or financial condition. For additional information about government
regulation and laws applicable to our business, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” including the risk
factor entitled “Our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially harmed
by evolving regulatory uncertainty or obligations applicable to our products and services” and Note

 Talent and Culture 
At Cisco, we value our people and our technology, and we leverage our broader ecosystems to
positively impact the world and pursue our purpose to Power an Inclusive Future for All. Our goal is
to attract, retain, and develop talent in order to help our customers connect and secure their
infrastructure, and accelerate their digital agility. Our relationship with our employees is one of
mutual benefit. Our employees bring talent and ingenuity to everything we do, and in turn, we provide
employees with meaningful careers and development opportunities.
Cisco is currently ranked #2 on the Fortune 100 Best Companies to Work For® 2024 in the United
States. Fortune and Great Place to Work have published their United States rankings since 1998, and
Cisco has been recognized on every annual list. Cisco is currently #1 in the following 18 countries:
Australia, Canada, Costa Rica, France, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Norway, Peru,
Portugal, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.
As of July 27, 2024, we had approximately 90,400 employees and they are categorized as follows:
We support our employees through times of change and enable them to be their best. We do this by
fostering a Conscious Culture. Conscious Culture speaks to the importance of everyone being aware —
“conscious” — of the environment they are part of, and feeling accountable, empowered, and expected
to contribute to creating a culture where all Cisco employees feel safe and can thrive. Conscious
Culture encourages employees to be aware of how we treat one another and to speak up when we see
behavior that’s out of step with our beliefs. We believe there is a direct connection between the
culture we create internally and how our people are helping to bring about a better world.
In the same way that every employee at Cisco is responsible for our Conscious Culture, we also want
every employee to feel responsible for and contribute to our purpose to Power an Inclusive Future for
All. We believe this is as much a commitment from Cisco as it is from our employees. Our people often
ask the toughest questions around how we are impacting society for the better, from addressing
homelessness to combating climate change. And often the best ideas for how we can do even more come
directly from them. Future employees expect it too. We recognize that talent increasingly wants to
work for a company where their work has meaning and where they see their values reflected in the
organization.
Inclusion & Diversity
Inclusion and diversity are core components in our Conscious Culture. Inclusivity is our strength and
our priority. We want every employee to feel valued, respected, and heard. We are prioritizing
inclusion and diversity across the company, recognizing that connecting people of all experiences and
backgrounds allows us to improve innovation and collaboration.
In order to continue accelerating diversity and finding extraordinary talent, we have designed a
framework that includes introducing new tools and technologies to help accurately map the talent
market, creating job roles that attract highly qualified diverse candidates, and expanding the
diversity within our interview panels.
We currently have a total of 31 Inclusive Communities supporting full-spectrum diversity globally,
including gender, ethnicity, race, sexual orientation, age, ability, veteran status, religion,
culture, background, as well as varied experiences, strengths, and perspectives. These thriving
communities continue to be a source of strength and support for employees, and they help to foster a
more Conscious Culture by providing opportunities for proximity and learning.

Cisco has signed the CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion Pledge. The CEO Action for Diversity &
Inclusion Pledge is a CEO-driven pledge to drive measurable action and meaningful change in advancing
diversity, equity and inclusion in the workplace. We are delivering on these actions by accelerating
diversity across the full-spectrum of diversity — including gender, age, race, ethnicity, sexual
orientation, ability, nationality, religion, veteran status, background, culture, experience,
strengths and perspectives. At Cisco, it starts at the top: As of July 27, 2024, 36% of our Executive
Leadership Team (ELT) are women and 43% are diverse in terms of gender or ethnicity.
We publish certain gender diversity and ethnic diversity workforce data annually. Across our global
company, we have driven broad improvements in overall workforce diversity. Based on our fiscal 2023
data, our global employee base was comprised of 29% women, 71% men and 0.1% nonbinary, and our U.S.
employee base was comprised of the following ethnicities: 48.2% White/Caucasian, 33.5% Asian, 6.5%
Hispanic/Latino, 5.6% African American/Black, 2.0% two or more races (not Hispanic or Latino), 0.3%
American Indian or Alaska Native, 0.2% Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander, and 3.7% prefer to not
to disclose/unknown.
With respect to social justice, Cisco has been partnering across the globe to scale and amplify our
positive impact. We have published our Social Justice Beliefs & Actions, which is our blueprint for
how we respond to injustice and address inequity for any community. We are creating actions that can
be replicated and scaled and are designed to cover the full spectrum of diversity, inclusive of
gender, generation, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, ability, nationality, and background — which
is the foundation of our Conscious Culture. This work is part of a plan for Cisco to drive
transformational, generational impact for vulnerable communities. Our Social Justice Action Office
helps drive accountability, progress, and excellence in our strategic actions in this area, which are
designed to address the broader ecosystem including our employees, partners, customers, and
suppliers.
Compensation and Benefits
Our total compensation philosophy is designed to attract, reward, and retain talent. It provides
market competitive, performance-based compensation aligned with each employee’s contribution and
impact to the value we drive to our customers, partners and stockholders. We reward and recognize our
employees for effecting innovation, collaboration, profitability, and growth within our geographies,
product lines, and functions.
Cisco has always been committed to compensating our employees fairly and equitably. We are a founding
signatory of the White House Equal Pay Pledge and the Parity.org pledge, and are a leader in the
charge to make fair pay a reality for all employees through the Employers for Pay Equity Consortium.
We have also introduced an innovative and inclusive framework that provides us powerful analytics to
evaluate our complex compensation system. For example, by using these powerful analytics, we are able
to test for pay parity on a regular basis, and when gaps are found, we strive to correct them.
As part of our Social Justice Beliefs and Actions, we have expanded our pay parity program beyond
base salary to include additional forms of compensation fairness such as promotion, bonuses, and
stock decisions made in our rewards programs. We aim to ensure the program addresses all employees
across the full spectrum of diversity incorporating our global self-reported data collection.
Health & Well-being
We have an ongoing commitment to focus on the health, safety, and well-being of our employees. We
seek to provide our employees and their families with high-quality, flexible, and convenient benefits
and resources for their physical, mental, and financial well-being. We strive to support our
employees as they balance careers and personal lives, as well as their own physical, emotional, and
financial health. We continue to emphasize a focus on both physical and mental health, recognizing
the need to create an environment where employees can speak openly about mental health and other
matters.
We host ongoing discussions with our employees during the Cisco Beat and Cisco Check-Ins, our regular
company-wide virtual meetings, and continue to emphasize our Safe to Talk program. We offer
mindfulness courses, employee assistance program offerings, and out-of-network provider benefits for
substance abuse and mental health treatment, and more. In fiscal 2024, we continued to offer
employees “A Day for Me,” which were paid days off that allowed for each individual to recharge and
rest. We employ a hybrid work model in certain countries, giving our employees the flexibility to
work offsite or at onsite Cisco locations.
Employee Development
We know careers are not static pathways that look the same for everyone. We also know that the world
of work will continue to rapidly evolve, requiring new skillsets. At Cisco, we believe that your
career is owned by you, supported by your leader, and enabled by Cisco. Cisco believes in open-ended
self-directed learning, understanding that each individual knows best what skills and resources they
need to succeed. This means that while each employee has the power to shape their career on their own
terms, they also have a supportive ecosystem to develop the skills they need to succeed both today
and tomorrow. We strive to
 9 
Table of Contents
create a culture of “one company, many careers.” We provide our people with career strategies focused
on areas we know determine a successful career at Cisco—personal brand, network, expertise, and
experience—and have created customized offerings that map to each of them.
Employee Engagement
We believe that strong communication is key in our Conscious Culture. These communications include
the Cisco Beat, which are regular all-hands meetings, and Cisco Check-Ins, which are ad-hoc meetings
for important conversations, and weekly team leader check-ins, which we refer to as a “Team Space
Check-In.” In fiscal 2024, we have seen a high level of employee engagement. As an example, there
were approximately 2.3 million Team Space Check-Ins by our employees in fiscal 2024, reflecting
approximately 70,300 employees (excludes employees who recently joined Cisco during fiscal 2024
through the Splunk acquisition) submitting Team Space Check-Ins. Employees also participate in our
global Engagement Pulse Survey and the Real Deal Survey. These surveys allow our employees to provide
confidential feedback on our culture, company strategy and trust in their direct leaders.

 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
Set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the SEC are
descriptions of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially
from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report.
 Risks Related to our Business and Industry 
Our operations can be difficult to predict because our operating results may fluctuate in future
periods.
Our operating results have been in the past, and will continue to be, subject to quarterly and annual
fluctuations as a result of numerous factors, some of which may contribute to more pronounced
fluctuations in an uncertain global economic environment. These factors include:
• Fluctuations in demand for our products and services, especially with respect to service providers
and internet businesses, in part due to changes in the global economic environment
• Changes in sales and implementation cycles for our products and reduced visibility into our
customers’ spending plans and associated revenue
• Our ability to maintain appropriate inventory levels and purchase commitments
• Price and product competition in the communications and networking industries, which can change
rapidly due to technological innovation and different business models from various geographic regions
• The overall movement toward industry consolidation among both our competitors and our customers
• The introduction and market acceptance of new technologies and products, and our success in new and
evolving markets, and in emerging technologies, as well as the adoption of new standards
• Variations in sales channels, product costs, mix of products sold, or mix of direct sales and
indirect sales
• The timing, size, and mix of orders from customers
• Manufacturing and customer lead times
• Fluctuations in our gross margins, and the factors that contribute to such fluctuations
• The ability of our customers, channel partners, contract manufacturers and suppliers to obtain
financing or to fund capital expenditures, especially during a period of global credit market
disruption or in the event of customer, channel partner, contract manufacturer or supplier financial
problems
• Actual events, circumstances, outcomes, and amounts differing from judgments, assumptions, and
estimates used in determining the values of certain assets (including the amounts of related
valuation allowances), liabilities, and other items reflected in our Consolidated Financial
Statements
• How well we execute on our strategy and operating plans and the impact of changes in our business
model that could result in significant restructuring charges
• Our ability to achieve targeted cost reductions
• Benefits anticipated from our investments
• Changes in tax laws or accounting rules, or interpretations thereof
As a consequence, operating results for a particular future period are difficult to predict, and,
therefore, prior results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods.
Any of the foregoing factors, or any other factors discussed elsewhere herein, could materially harm
our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
Our operating results may be negatively impacted by unfavorable economic and market conditions and
the uncertain geopolitical environment.
Challenging economic conditions, including rising inflation, or other changes, worldwide have from
time to time contributed, and may continue to contribute, to slowdowns in the communications and
networking industries at large, as well as in specific segments and markets in which we operate,
resulting in: reduced demand for our products as a result of continued constraints on IT-related
capital spending by our customers, particularly service provider and cloud as well as enterprise and
other customer markets; increased price competition for our products, not only from our competitors
but also as a consequence of customers disposing of unutilized products; risk of excess and obsolete
inventories; risk of supply constraints; risk of excess facilities and manufacturing capacity; and
higher overhead costs as a percentage of revenue and higher interest expense.
The global macroeconomic environment can be challenging and inconsistent. In certain prior periods,
we have seen a broad-based weakening in the global macroeconomic environment which has impacted and
could impact in the future certain of our markets. Additionally, instability in the global credit
markets, the impact of uncertainty regarding global central bank monetary
 12 
Table of Contents
policy, the instability in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the world (including as a
result of the on-going Russia and Ukraine war, the Israel-Hamas war, and China-Taiwan relations), the
current economic challenges in China, including global economic ramifications of Chinese economic
difficulties, and other disruptions may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions. If
global economic and market conditions, or economic conditions in key markets, were to deteriorate, we
may experience material harm to our business, operating results, and financial condition.
Our operating results in one or more segments may also be affected by uncertain or changing economic
conditions particularly germane to that segment or to particular customer markets within that
segment. In addition, reports of certain intelligence gathering methods of the U.S. government could
affect customers’ perception of the products of IT companies which design and manufacture products in
the United States. Trust and confidence in us as an IT supplier are critical to the development and
growth of our markets. Impairment of that trust, or foreign regulatory actions taken in response to
reports of certain intelligence gathering methods of the U.S. government, could affect the demand for
our products from customers outside of the United States and could have a negative impact on our
operating results.
Our revenue for a particular period is difficult to predict, and a shortfall in revenue may harm our
operating results.
As a result of a variety of factors discussed in this report, our revenue for a particular quarter is
difficult to predict, which can be exacerbated during periods when the global macroenvironment is
challenging and inconsistent and can result in market uncertainty. Our revenue may grow at a slower
rate than in past periods, or decline as it did in fiscal 2024 and certain prior periods on a year-
over-year basis. Our ability to meet financial expectations could also be negatively impacted if the
nonlinear sales pattern seen in some of our past quarters recurs in future periods. During the first
nine months of fiscal 2024, we experienced a decline in product demand resulting in a decrease of
revenue as customers continued to scrutinize spend as they needed additional time to implement
elevated levels of product shipments received in prior quarters. We have also experienced periods of
time during which shipments have exceeded net bookings or manufacturing issues have delayed
shipments, leading to nonlinearity in shipping patterns. In addition to making it difficult to
predict revenue for a particular period, nonlinearity in shipping can increase costs, because
irregular shipment patterns result in periods of underutilized capacity and periods in which overtime
expenses may be incurred, as well as in potential additional inventory management-related costs. In
addition, to the extent that manufacturing issues and any related component shortages result in
delayed shipments in the future, and particularly in periods in which our contract manufacturers are
operating at higher levels of capacity, it is possible that revenue for a quarter could be negatively
impacted if such matters occur and are not remediated within the same quarter.
The timing of large orders can also have a significant impact on our business and operating results
from quarter to quarter. From time to time, we receive large orders that have a significant effect on
our operating results in the period in which the order is recognized as revenue. The timing of such
orders is difficult to predict, and the timing of revenue recognition from such orders may affect
period to period changes in revenue. As a result, our operating results could vary materially from
quarter to quarter based on the receipt of such orders and their ultimate recognition as revenue.
Longer than normal manufacturing lead times in the past have caused, and in the future could cause,
some customers to place the same or a similar order multiple times within our various sales channels
and to cancel the duplicative orders upon shipment or receipt of the product, or to also place orders
with other vendors with shorter manufacturing lead times. Such multiple ordering (along with other
factors) or risk of order cancellation may cause difficulty in predicting our revenue. Further, our
efforts to improve manufacturing lead-time performance may result in more variability and less
predictability in our revenue and operating results. In addition, when facing component supply-
related challenges, we have in the past and may in the future increase our efforts in procuring
components in order to meet customer expectations, which in turn contributes to an increase in
inventory and purchase commitments. These increases in our inventory and purchase commitments to
shorten lead times could also lead to potential material excess and obsolete inventory charges or
other negative impacts to our product gross margin in future periods if product demand significantly
decreases for a sustained duration, we are unable to generate demand for certain products planned for
development, or we are unable to continue to mitigate the remaining supply chain exposures. Product
demand conditions for future periods can be difficult to predict or may persist longer than
anticipated. We plan our operating expense levels based primarily on forecasted revenue levels. These
expenses and the impact of long-term commitments are relatively fixed in the short term. A shortfall
in revenue could lead to operating results being below expectations because we may not be able to
quickly reduce these fixed expenses in response to short-term business changes. Any of the above
factors could materially harm our operations and financial results. For additional information and a
further discussion of impacts and risks related to our inventory commitments and our purchase
commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, see “Results of Operations—Product Gross
Margin—Supply Chain Impacts and Risks”, “Liquidity and Capital Resources—Inventory Supply Chain”
under Item 7 and Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this report.

Supply chain issues, including financial problems of contract manufacturers or component suppliers,
or a shortage of adequate component supply or manufacturing capacity that increase our costs or cause
a delay in our ability to fulfill orders, could have an adverse impact on our business and operating
results, and our failure to estimate customer demand properly may result in excess or obsolete
component supply, which could negatively impact our gross margins.
The fact that we do not own or operate the bulk of our manufacturing facilities and that we are
reliant on our extended supply chain could have an adverse impact on the supply of our products and
on our business and operating results. Financial problems of either contract manufacturers or
component suppliers, reservation of manufacturing capacity at our contract manufacturers by other
companies, and industry consolidation occurring within one or more component supplier markets, such
as the semiconductor market, in each case, could either limit supply or increase costs.
A reduction or interruption in supply, including disruptions on our global supply chain, caused in
part by public health emergencies, geopolitical tensions (including as a result of China-Taiwan
relations) or a significant natural disaster (including as a result of climate change); a significant
increase in the price of one or more components (including as a result of inflation); a failure to
adequately authorize procurement of inventory by our contract manufacturers; a failure to
appropriately cancel, reschedule, or adjust our requirements based on our business needs; or a
decrease in demand for our products could materially harm our business, operating results, and
financial condition and could materially damage customer relationships. Furthermore, as a result of
binding price or purchase commitments with suppliers, we may be obligated to purchase components at
prices that are higher than those available in the current market. In the event that we become
committed to purchase components at prices in excess of the current market price when the components
are actually used, our gross margins could decrease. In addition, vendors may be under pressure to
allocate product to certain customers for business, regulatory or political reasons, and/or demand
changes in agreed pricing as a condition of supply. Although we have generally secured additional
supply or taken other mitigation actions when significant disruptions have occurred, if similar
situations occur in the future, they could materially harm our business, results of operations, and
financial condition.
Our growth and ability to meet customer demands depend in part on our ability to obtain timely
deliveries of parts from our suppliers and contract manufacturers. We have experienced component
shortages in the past, including shortages caused by manufacturing process issues, that have affected
our operations, including longer than normal lead times. For example, in recent periods, there was a
market shortage of semiconductor and other component supply which affected lead times, the cost of
that supply, and our ability to meet customer demand for our products. Additionally, we may in the
future experience a shortage of certain component parts as a result of our own manufacturing issues,
manufacturing issues at our suppliers or contract manufacturers, capacity problems experienced by our
suppliers or contract manufacturers including capacity or cost problems resulting from industry
consolidation, or strong demand for those parts. Growth in the economy is likely to create greater
pressures on us and our suppliers to accurately project overall component demand and component
demands within specific product categories and to establish optimal component levels and
manufacturing capacity, especially for labor-intensive components, components for which we purchase a
substantial portion of the supply, or the re-ramping of manufacturing capacity for highly complex
products. During periods of shortages or delays the price of components may increase, or the
components may not be available at all, and we may also encounter shortages if we do not accurately
anticipate our needs. We may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of
acceptable quality to build new products in a timely manner in the quantities or configurations
needed. Accordingly, our revenue and gross margins could suffer until other sources can be developed.
Although in many cases we use standard parts and components for our products, certain components are
presently available only from a single source or limited sources, and a global economic downturn and
related market uncertainty could negatively impact the availability of components from one or more of
these sources, especially during times when there are supplier constraints based on labor and other
actions taken during economic downturns. We may not be able to diversify sources in a timely manner,
which could harm our ability to deliver products to customers and seriously impact present and future
sales.
We believe that we may be faced with the following challenges in the future: new markets in which we
participate may grow quickly, which may make it difficult to quickly obtain significant component
capacity; as we acquire companies and new technologies, we may be dependent on unfamiliar supply
chains or relatively small supply partners; and we face competition for certain components that are
supply-constrained, from existing competitors, and companies in other markets.
Manufacturing capacity and component supply constraints could continue to be significant issues for
us. We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to
provide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of business, in order to
improve manufacturing lead-time performance and to help ensure adequate component supply, we enter
into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that either allow them to procure inventory
based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements. In
certain instances, these agreements allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our
requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed. When facing component
supply-related challenges we have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to meet
customer expectations, which in turn contributes to an increase in inventory and purchase
 14 
Table of Contents
commitments. In past periods, we increased our inventory and purchase commitments in light of the
supply constraints seen industry-wide due to component shortages. These increases in our inventory
and purchase commitments to shorten lead times could also lead to potential material excess and
obsolete inventory charges or other negative impacts to our product gross margin in future periods if
we fail to anticipate customer demand properly and product demand significantly decreases for a
sustained duration, we are unable to generate demand for certain products planned for development, or
we are unable to continue to mitigate the remaining supply chain exposures. Product demand conditions
for future periods can be difficult to predict or may persist longer than anticipated. For additional
information and a further discussion of impacts and risks related to our inventory commitments and
our purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, see “Results of
Operations—Product Gross Margin—Supply Chain Impacts and Risks” and, “Liquidity and Capital
Resources—Inventory Supply Chain” under Item 7 and Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
of this report.
We expect gross margin to vary over time, and our level of product gross margin may not be
sustainable.
Although our product gross margin increased in fiscal 2024, our level of product gross margins have
declined in certain prior periods, and could decline in future periods due to adverse impacts from
various factors, including:
• Changes in customer, geographic, or product mix, including the mix of hardware and software
• Introduction of new products, including products with price-performance advantages, and new
business models (including continuing to increase the use of business models where revenue is
recognized over multiple periods)
• Our ability to reduce production costs
• Entry into new markets or growth in lower margin markets, including markets with different pricing
and cost structures, through acquisitions or internal development
• Sales discounts
• Increases in material, labor or other manufacturing-related costs (i.e. component costs, broker
fees, expedited freight and overtime) or higher supply chain logistics costs, any of which could be
significant, especially during periods of supply constraints for certain costs, such as those that
have impacted the market for components, including semiconductors and memory in past periods, and
which costs have in the past and may continue to be exacerbated by inflation
• Excess inventory, inventory holding charges, and obsolescence charges
• Changes in shipment volume
• The timing of revenue recognition and revenue deferrals
• Increased costs (including those caused by tariffs or economic conditions, including inflation),
loss of cost savings or dilution of savings due to changes in component pricing or charges incurred
due to inventory holding periods if parts ordering does not correctly anticipate product demand or if
the financial health of either contract manufacturers or suppliers deteriorates
• Lower than expected benefits from value engineering
• Increased price competition, including competitors from Asia, especially from China
• Changes in distribution channels
• Increased warranty or royalty costs
• Increased amortization of purchased intangible assets, especially from acquisitions
• How well we execute on our strategy and operating plans
Changes in service gross margin may result from various factors such as changes in the mix between
technical support services and advanced services, as well as the timing of technical support service
contract initiations and renewals, the addition of personnel and other related costs, and other
resources to support higher levels of service business in future periods.
Sales to the service provider and cloud market are especially volatile, and weakness in orders from
this industry may harm our operating results and financial condition.
Sales to the service provider and cloud market have been characterized by large and sporadic
purchases, especially relating to our router sales and sales of certain other Networking and
Collaboration products, in addition to longer sales cycles. Service provider and cloud product orders
significantly decreased during fiscal 2024 and we have experienced similar declines in certain prior
periods. Product orders from the service provider and cloud market could continue to decline and, as
has been the case in the past, such weakness could persist over extended periods of time given
fluctuating market conditions. Products in the service provider and cloud market could also face a
high degree of customer concentration, with bespoke product designs and features that would be
difficult to sell to alternate customers should the primary customer reduce its product orders with
Cisco. Sales activity in this industry depends upon the stage of completion of expanding network
infrastructures; the availability of
 15 
Table of Contents
funding; and the extent to which service provider and cloud customers are affected by regulatory,
economic, and business conditions in the country of operations. Weakness in orders from this
industry, including as a result of any slowdown in capital expenditures by service providers (which
may be more prevalent during a global economic downturn, or periods of economic, political or
regulatory uncertainty), could materially harm our business, operating results, and financial
condition. Such slowdowns may continue or recur in future periods. Orders from this industry could
decline for many reasons other than the competitiveness of our products and services within their
respective markets. For example, in the past, many of our service provider and cloud customers have
been negatively impacted by slowdowns in the general economy, by overcapacity, by changes in the
service provider and cloud market, by regulatory developments, and by constraints on capital
availability, resulting in business failures and substantial reductions in spending and expansion
plans. These conditions have negatively impacted our business and operating results in the past, and
could materially harm our business and operating results in any future period. Finally, service
provider and cloud customers typically have longer implementation cycles; require a broader range of
services, including design services; demand that vendors take on a larger share of risks; often
require acceptance provisions, which can lead to a delay in revenue recognition; and expect financing
from vendors. All these factors can add further risk to business conducted with service providers.
Disruption of or changes in our distribution model could harm our sales and margins.
If we fail to manage distribution of our products and services properly, or if our distributors’
financial condition or operations weaken, our revenue and gross margins could be negatively impacted.
A substantial portion of our products and services is sold through our channel partners, and the
remainder is sold through direct sales. Our channel partners include systems integrators, service
providers, other third-party resellers, and distributors. Systems integrators and service providers
typically sell directly to end users and often provide system installation, technical support,
professional services, and other support services in addition to network equipment sales. Systems
integrators also typically integrate our products into an overall solution, and a number of service
providers are also systems integrators. Distributors stock inventory and typically sell to systems
integrators, service providers, and other third-party resellers. We refer to sales through
distributors as our two-tier system of sales to the end customer. If sales through indirect channels
increase, this may lead to greater difficulty in forecasting the mix of our products and, to a
degree, the timing of orders from our customers.
Historically, we have seen fluctuations in our gross margins based on changes in the balance of our
distribution channels. There can be no assurance that changes in the balance of our distribution
model in future periods would not have an adverse effect on our gross margins and profitability. Some
factors could result in disruption of or changes in our distribution model, which could harm our
sales and margins, including the following: competition with some of our channel partners, including
through our direct sales, which may lead these channel partners to use other suppliers that do not
directly sell their own products or otherwise compete with them; some of our channel partners may
demand that we absorb a greater share of the risks that their customers may ask them to bear; some of
our channel partners may have insufficient financial resources and may not be able to withstand
changes and challenges in business conditions; and revenue from indirect sales could suffer if our
distributors’ financial condition or operations weaken. In addition, we depend on our channel
partners globally to comply with applicable regulatory requirements. To the extent that they fail to
do so, that could materially harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. Further,
sales of our products outside of agreed territories can result in disruption to our distribution
channels.
The markets in which we compete are intensely competitive, which could negatively impact our
achievement of revenue growth.
The markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid change, converging technologies, and a
migration to networking and communications solutions that offer relative advantages. These market
factors represent a competitive threat to us. We compete with numerous vendors in each product
category. The overall number of our competitors providing niche product solutions may increase. Also,
the identity and composition of competitors may change as we increase our activity in newer product
areas, and in key priority areas. For example, as products related to network programmability, such
as software defined networking (SDN) products, have become more prevalent, we have faced increased
competition from companies that develop networking products based on commoditized hardware, referred
to as “white box” hardware, to the extent customers decide to purchase those product offerings
instead of ours. In addition, the growth in demand for technology delivered as a service enables new
competitors to enter the market. As we continue to expand globally, we may see new competition in
different geographic regions. In particular, we have experienced price-focused competition from
competitors in Asia, especially from China, and we anticipate this will continue. For information
regarding our competitors, see the section entitled “Competition” contained in “Item 1. Business” of
this report.
Some of our competitors compete across many of our product lines, while others are primarily focused
in a specific product area. Barriers to entry are relatively low, and new ventures to create products
that do or could compete with our products are regularly formed. In addition, some of our competitors
may have greater resources, including technical and engineering resources, than we do. As we expand
into new markets, we will face competition not only from our existing competitors but

also from other competitors, including existing companies with strong technological, marketing, and
sales positions in those markets. We also sometimes face competition from resellers and distributors
of our products. Companies with which we have strategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in
other areas, and this trend may increase. For example, the enterprise data center is undergoing a
fundamental transformation arising from the convergence of technologies, including computing,
networking, storage, and software, that previously were segregated. Due to several factors, including
the availability of highly scalable and general purpose microprocessors, ASICs offering advanced
services, standards based protocols, cloud computing and virtualization, the convergence of
technologies within the enterprise data center is spanning multiple, previously independent,
technology segments. Also, some of our current and potential competitors for enterprise data center
business have made acquisitions, or announced new strategic alliances, designed to position them to
provide end-to-end technology solutions for the enterprise data center. As a result of all of these
developments, we face greater competition in the development and sale of enterprise data center
technologies, including competition from entities that are among our long-term strategic alliance
partners. Companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or
form alliances with our competitors, thereby reducing their business with us.
We also face competition from customers to which we license or supply technology and suppliers from
which we transfer technology. The inherent nature of networking requires interoperability. As such,
we must cooperate and at the same time compete with many companies. Any inability to effectively
manage these complicated relationships with customers, suppliers, and strategic alliance partners
could materially harm our business, operating results, and financial condition and accordingly affect
our chances of success.
If we do not successfully manage our strategic alliances, we may not realize the expected benefits
from such alliances, and we may experience increased competition or delays in product development.
We have several strategic alliances with large and complex organizations and other companies with
which we work to offer complementary products and services. These arrangements are generally limited
to specific projects, the goal of which is generally to facilitate product compatibility and adoption
of industry standards. There can be no assurance we will realize the expected benefits from these
strategic alliances or from joint ventures. If successful, these relationships may be mutually
beneficial and result in industry growth. However, alliances carry an element of risk because, in
most cases, we must compete in some business areas with a company with which we have a strategic
alliance and, at the same time, cooperate with that company in other business areas. Also, if these
companies fail to perform or if these relationships fail to materialize as expected, we could suffer
delays in product development or other operational difficulties. Joint ventures can be difficult to
manage, given the potentially different interests of joint venture partners.
Inventory management relating to our sales to our two-tier distribution channel is complex, and
excess inventory may harm our gross margins.
We must manage inventory relating to sales to our distributors effectively, because inventory held by
them could affect our results of operations. Our distributors may increase orders during periods of
product shortages, cancel orders if their inventory is too high, or delay orders in anticipation of
new products. They also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the
products of our competitors that are available to them, and in response to seasonal fluctuations in
end-user demand. Our distributors are generally given business terms that allow them to return a
portion of inventory, receive credits for changes in selling price, and participate in various
cooperative marketing programs. Inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need
to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory
obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements. When facing component
supply-related challenges, we have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to meet
customer expectations. If we ultimately determine that we have excess inventory, we may have to
reduce our prices and write down inventory, which in turn could result in lower gross margins.
Our financial performance may be negatively impacted by demand for, and costs to deliver, our
software subscription offerings; and interruptions or performance problems associated with these
offerings, including interruptions or performance problems caused by third-party providers on which
we rely, may negatively impact our business and financial results.
In recent years, we have shifted our business model to deliver more recurring software and
subscription offerings. This shift in our business model was accelerated by recent acquisitions,
including our acquisition of Splunk in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Market acceptance of our
software subscription offerings, which includes our as-a-service solutions, can be affected by a
variety of factors, including: security, reliability, performance, terms of service, support terms,
customer preference, community engagement, concerns regarding data privacy or data protection, and
the enactment of laws or regulations in jurisdictions in which we operate. To generate sales growth
for our software subscription offerings, we need to convince potential customers to purchase new
licenses or subscriptions and generate timely renewals and additional purchases from existing
customers. Any failure to do so could result in decreased revenue, reduced sales, increased churn or
otherwise negatively impact our results of
 17 
Table of Contents
operations and financial condition. Further, growth of our software subscription offerings depends,
in part, on the ability of customers to use and access these solutions. We have experienced, and may
in the future experience, interruptions in service, storage failures, and other performance-related
problems due to a variety of factors, such as infrastructure and software changes, human or software
errors, capacity constraints, unauthorized access, denial of service or other cyber attacks. In some
instances, we may not be able to timely identify the cause or causes of these performance problems
and, even if timely identified, we may be unable to timely remediate the underlying cause. It may
become increasingly difficult to maintain and improve our performance for our software subscription
offerings, especially during peak usage times and as our solutions become more complex and our user
traffic increases. Performance-related issues of our software subscription offerings may result in
increased operational costs, delays in new feature rollouts, customer loss, reputational damage, and
legal or regulatory liability, including liability under customer contracts or for losses suffered by
our customers.
To deliver our software subscription offerings, we have incurred and will continue to incur
substantial costs to implement and maintain this business. We make significant investments to
increase or maintain capacity and to develop and implement new technologies in our infrastructure and
operations, including those provided by third-party providers on which we rely. We may not be
successful in developing or implementing these technologies. To the extent that we do not effectively
scale our operations to meet the needs of our customers and to maintain performance as our customers
expand their use of our solutions, we may not be able to grow this business as quickly as we
anticipate, our customers may reduce or cancel use of our solutions, and we may be unable to compete
as effectively and our business and results of operations may be harmed. Additionally, if our costs
associated with our software subscription offerings were to significantly increase, our business,
results of operations and financial condition may be negatively impacted. We are also subject to the
risk of performance-related problems or interruption of the services provided by third-party
providers on which we rely, which could cause revenues for software subscription offerings to
decline, damage to our reputation, legal liability exposure, and/or increased expenses, all of which
could negatively impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
We depend upon the development of new products and services, and enhancements to existing products
and services, and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers’
changing needs, our operating results and market share may suffer.
The markets for our products and services are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving
industry standards, new product and service introductions, and evolving methods of building and
operating networks. Our operating results depend on our ability to develop and introduce new products
and services into existing and emerging markets and to reduce the production costs of existing
products. If customers do not purchase and/or renew our offerings our business could be harmed.
The process of developing new technology, including more programmable, flexible and virtual networks,
and technology related to other market transitions— such as artificial intelligence, security,
observability, and cloud— is complex and uncertain, and if we fail to accurately predict customers’
changing needs and emerging technological trends our business could be harmed. We must commit
significant resources, including the investments we have been making in our strategic priorities to
developing new products and services before knowing whether our investments will result in products
and services the market will accept. In particular, if our model of the evolution of networking,
security, or observability does not emerge as we believe it will, or these industries do not evolve
as we believe they will, or if our strategy for addressing this evolution is not successful, many of
our strategic initiatives and investments may be of no or limited value. For example, if we do not
introduce products related to these markets in a timely fashion, or if product offerings in this
market that ultimately succeed are based on technology, or an approach to technology, that differs
from ours, our business could be harmed. Similarly, our business could be harmed if we fail to
develop, or fail to develop in a timely fashion, offerings to address other transitions, or if the
offerings addressing these other transitions that ultimately succeed are based on technology, or an
approach to technology, different from ours. In addition, our business could be negatively impacted
in periods surrounding our new product introductions if customers delay purchasing decisions to
qualify or otherwise evaluate the new product offerings. We have also been seeking to meet the
evolving needs of customers which include offering our products and solutions in the manner in which
customers wish to consume them. As a part of these efforts, we continue to make changes to how we are
organized and how we build and deliver our technology, including changes in our business models with
customers. If our strategy for addressing our customer needs, or the architectures and solutions we
develop do not meet those needs, or the changes we are making in how we are organized and how we
build and deliver or technology is incorrect or ineffective, our business could be harmed.
Furthermore, we may not execute successfully on our vision or strategy because of challenges with
regard to product planning and timing, technical hurdles that we fail to overcome in a timely
fashion, or a lack of appropriate resources. This could result in competitors, some of which may also
be our strategic alliance partners, providing those solutions before we do and loss of market share,
revenue, and earnings. In addition, the growth in demand for technology delivered as a service
enables new competitors to enter the market. The success of new products and services depends on
several factors, including proper new product and service definition, component costs, timely
completion and introduction of these products and services, differentiation of new products and
services from those of our competitors, and market acceptance of these products and
 18 
Table of Contents
services. There can be no assurance that we will successfully identify new product and services
opportunities, develop and bring new products and services to market in a timely manner, or achieve
market acceptance of our products and services or that products, services and technologies developed
by others will not render our products, services or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive. The
products and technologies in our other product categories and key priority areas may not prove to
have the market success we anticipate, and we may not successfully identify and invest in other
emerging or new products and services.
Changes in industry structure and market conditions could lead to charges related to discontinuances
of certain of our products or businesses, asset impairments and workforce reductions or
restructurings.
In response to changes in industry and market conditions, we may be required to strategically realign
our resources and to consider restructuring, disposing of, or otherwise exiting businesses. Any
resource realignment, or decision to limit investment in or dispose of or otherwise exit businesses,
may result in the recording of special charges, such as inventory and technology-related write-offs,
workforce reduction or restructuring costs, charges relating to consolidation of excess facilities,
or claims from third parties who were resellers or users of discontinued products. Our estimates with
respect to the useful life or ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis of assets, including
purchased intangible assets, could change as a result of such assessments and decisions. Although in
certain instances our supply agreements allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our
requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed, our loss contingencies
may include liabilities for contracts that we cannot cancel with contract manufacturers and
suppliers. Further, our estimates relating to the liabilities for excess facilities are affected by
changes in real estate market conditions. Additionally, we are required to perform goodwill
impairment tests on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances, and future
goodwill impairment tests may result in a charge to earnings. From time to time we initiate
restructuring plans. Our business may not be more efficient or effective than prior to implementation
of such plans. Our restructuring activities, including any related charges and the impact of the
related headcount restructurings, could materially harm our business, operating results, and
financial condition.
Over the long term we intend to invest in engineering, sales, service and marketing activities, and
in key priority areas, and these investments may achieve delayed, or lower than expected, benefits
which could harm our operating results.
While we intend to focus on managing our costs and expenses, over the long term, we also intend to
invest in personnel and other resources related to our engineering, sales, service and marketing
functions as we realign and dedicate resources on key priority areas, such as AI, cloud, and
cybersecurity. We also intend to focus on maintaining leadership in core networking and services. We
are likely to recognize the costs associated with these investments earlier than some of the
anticipated benefits, and the return on these investments may be lower, or may develop more slowly,
than we expect. If we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments (including if
our selection of areas for investment does not play out as we expect), or if the achievement of these
benefits is delayed, our operating results may be negatively impacted.
We have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions that could disrupt our operations and harm
our operating results.
Our growth depends upon market growth, our ability to enhance our existing products, and our ability
to introduce new products on a timely basis. We intend to continue to address the need to develop new
products and enhance existing products through acquisitions of other companies, product lines,
technologies, and personnel. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following:
• Difficulties or delays in integrating the operations (including IT security), systems,
technologies, products, and personnel of the acquired companies, particularly with companies that
have large and widespread operations and/or complex products (such as Splunk)
• Diversion of management’s attention from normal daily operations of the business and the challenges
of managing larger and more widespread operations resulting from acquisitions
• Potential difficulties in completing projects associated with in-process research and development
intangibles
• Difficulties in entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where
competitors in such markets have stronger market positions
• Initial dependence on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners
• Insufficient revenue to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions
• The potential loss of key employees, customers, distributors, vendors and other business partners
of the companies we acquire following and continuing after announcement of acquisition plans
 19 
Table of Contents
Acquisitions have in the past and may in the future also cause us to:
• Issue common stock that would dilute our current stockholders’ percentage ownership
• Use a substantial portion of our cash resources, or incur debt
• Significantly increase our interest expense, leverage and debt service requirements if we incur
additional debt to pay for an acquisition
• Assume liabilities
• Record goodwill and intangible assets that are subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and
potential periodic impairment charges
• Incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets
• Incur tax expenses related to the effect of acquisitions on our legal structure
• Incur large write-offs and restructuring and other related expenses
• Become subject to intellectual property or other litigation
Mergers and acquisitions of high-technology companies are inherently risky and subject to many
factors outside of our control, and no assurance can be given that our previous or future
acquisitions will be successful and will not materially harm our business, operating results, or
financial condition. Failure to manage and successfully integrate acquisitions could materially harm
our business and operating results. Prior acquisitions have resulted in a wide range of outcomes,
from successful introduction of new products and technologies to a failure to do so. Even when an
acquired company has already developed and marketed products, there can be no assurance that product
enhancements will be made in a timely fashion or that pre-acquisition due diligence will have
identified all possible issues that might arise with respect to such products. In addition, our
effective tax rate for future periods is uncertain and could be impacted by mergers and acquisitions.
Risks described with respect to new product development also apply to acquisitions.
Entrance into new or developing markets exposes us to additional competition and will likely increase
demands on our service and support operations.
As we focus on new market opportunities and key priority areas, such as AI, cloud, and cybersecurity,
we compete with companies of all sizes. Several of our competitors may have greater resources,
including technical and engineering resources, than we do. Additionally, as customers complete
infrastructure deployments, they may require greater levels of service, support, and financing than
we have provided in the past, especially in emerging countries. Demand for these types of service,
support, or financing contracts may increase in the future. There can be no assurance that we can
provide products, service, support, and financing to effectively compete for these market
opportunities. Further, entry into other markets has subjected and will subject us to additional
risks, particularly to those markets, including the effects of general market conditions and reduced
consumer confidence. For example, as we add direct selling capabilities globally to meet changing
customer demands, we will face increased legal and regulatory requirements.
Product quality problems could lead to reduced revenue, gross margins, and net income.
We produce highly complex products that incorporate leading-edge technology, including both hardware
and software. Software typically contains bugs or other quality or reliability problems that can
unexpectedly interfere with its intended operations or the intended operation of the systems in which
our software is installed. There can be no assurance that our pre-shipment or pre-release testing
programs will be adequate to detect all defects, either ones in individual products or ones that
could affect numerous shipments, which might interfere with customer satisfaction, reduce sales
opportunities, or affect gross margins. From time to time, we have had to replace certain components
and provide remediation in response to the discovery of defects or bugs in products that we had
shipped. There can be no assurance that such remediation, depending on the product involved, would
not have a material impact. An inability to cure a product defect or bug could result in the failure
of a product line, temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market, damage to our
reputation, inventory costs, product reengineering expenses or legal liability, any of which could
materially harm our revenue, margins, and net income.
Due to the global nature of our operations, political or economic changes or other factors in a
specific country or region could harm our operating results and financial condition.
We conduct significant sales and customer support operations in countries around the world. As such,
our growth depends in part on our increasing sales into emerging countries. We also depend on
non-U.S. operations of our contract manufacturers, component suppliers and distribution partners. Our
business in emerging countries in the aggregate experienced a decline in orders in certain prior
periods. We continue to assess the sustainability of any improvements in our business in these
countries and there can be no assurance that our investments in these countries will be successful.
Our future results could be negatively impacted by a variety of political, economic or other factors
relating to our operations inside and outside the United States, any or all of which could materially
harm our operating results and financial condition, including the following: impacts from
 20 
Table of Contents
global central bank monetary policy; issues related to the political relationship between the United
States and other countries that can affect regulatory matters, affect the willingness of customers in
those countries to purchase products from companies headquartered in the United States or affect our
ability to procure components if a government body were to deny us access to those components;
government-related disruptions or shutdowns; the challenging and inconsistent global macroeconomic
environment; foreign currency exchange rates; geopolitical tensions (including China-Taiwan
relations); political or social unrest; economic instability or weakness or natural disasters in a
specific country or region, including economic challenges in China and global economic ramifications
of Chinese economic difficulties; environmental protection regulations (including new laws and
regulations related to climate change); trade protection measures, such as tariffs; other legal and
regulatory requirements, some of which may affect our ability to import our products to, export our
products from, or sell our products in various countries or affect our ability to procure components;
political considerations that affect service provider and government spending patterns; health or
similar issues, including pandemics or epidemics; difficulties in staffing and managing international
operations; and adverse tax consequences, including imposition of withholding or other taxes on our
global operations.
Issues related to the development and use of artificial intelligence (AI) could give rise to legal
and/or regulatory action, damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm of our business.
We currently incorporate AI technology in certain of our products and services and in our business
operations. Our research and development of such technology remains ongoing. AI presents risks and
challenges and may result in unintended consequences that could affect its further development or our
and our customers’ adoption and use of this technology. AI algorithms and training methodologies may
be flawed. Additionally, AI technologies are complex and rapidly evolving, and we face significant
competition in the market and from other companies regarding such technologies. Leveraging AI
capabilities to potentially improve our internal functions and operations also presents further
risks, costs, and challenges. While we aim to develop and use AI responsibly and attempt to identify
and mitigate ethical and legal issues presented by its use, we may be unsuccessful in identifying or
resolving issues before they arise. The AI-related legal and regulatory landscape remains uncertain
and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Our obligations to comply with the
evolving legal and regulatory landscape could entail significant costs or limit our ability to
incorporate certain AI capabilities into our offerings. AI-related issues, deficiencies and/or
failures could also give rise to legal and/or regulatory action, including with respect to proposed
legislation regulating AI in jurisdictions such as the European Union and others, and as a result of
new applications of existing data protection, privacy, intellectual property, and other laws; damage
our reputation; or otherwise materially harm our business.
We are exposed to the credit risk of some of our customers and to credit exposures in weakened
markets, which could result in material losses.
Most of our sales are on an open credit basis, with typical payment terms of 30 days in the United
States, and, because of local customs or conditions, longer in some markets outside the United
States. Beyond our open credit arrangements, we have also experienced demands for customer financing
and facilitation of leasing arrangements. Our loan financing arrangements may include not only
financing the acquisition of our products and services but also providing additional funds for other
costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services. Our exposure
to the credit risks relating to our financing activities may increase if our customers are negatively
impacted by a global economic downturn or periods of economic uncertainty. There can be no assurance
that programs we have in place to monitor and mitigate credit risks will be effective. In the past,
there have been significant bankruptcies among customers both on open credit and with loan or lease
financing arrangements, particularly among internet businesses and service providers, causing us to
incur economic or financial losses. There can be no assurance that additional losses will not be
incurred. Although these losses have not been material to date, future losses, if incurred, could
materially harm our business, operating results, or financial condition. Additionally, to the degree
that turmoil in the credit markets makes it more difficult for some customers to obtain financing,
those customers’ ability to pay could be adversely impacted, which in turn could materially harm our
business, operating results, and financial condition.
We are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest
rates; impairment of our investments could harm our earnings.
We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. Our portfolio
includes available-for-sale debt investments and equity investments, the values of which are subject
to market price volatility. If such investments suffer market price declines, as we experienced with
some of our investments in the past, we may recognize in earnings the decline in the fair value of
our investments below their cost basis. Our privately held investments are subject to risk of loss of
investment capital. These investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies
or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize.
We could lose our entire investment in these companies. For information regarding the market risks
associated with the fair value of portfolio investments and interest rates, refer to the section
titled “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”
 21 
Table of Contents
We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial
results and cash flows.
Because a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the United States, we face
exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates, including emerging market
currencies which can have extreme currency volatility. An increase in the value of the dollar could
increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the United States
where we sell in dollars and a weakened dollar could increase the cost of local operating expenses
and procurement of raw materials to the extent that we must purchase components in foreign
currencies. These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve, and they could
materially harm our financial results and cash flows.
Failure to retain and recruit key personnel would harm our ability to meet key objectives.
Our success has always depended in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled
technical, managerial, sales, and marketing personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense,
especially in the Silicon Valley area of Northern California and other major United States locations.
Stock incentive plans are designed to reward employees for their long-term contributions and provide
incentives for them to remain with us. Volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price
or equity incentive awards, or changes to our overall compensation program, including our stock
incentive program, resulting from the management of share dilution and share-based compensation
expense or otherwise, may also negatively impact our ability to retain key employees. As a result of
one or more of these factors, we may increase our hiring in geographic areas outside the United
States, which could subject us to additional geopolitical and exchange rate risk. The loss of
services of any of our key personnel; the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the
future; or delays in hiring required personnel, particularly in engineering and sales fields, could
make it difficult to meet key objectives, such as timely and effective product introductions. In
addition, companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently
claim that competitors have engaged in improper hiring practices. We have received these claims in
the past and may receive additional claims in the future.
Adverse resolution of litigation or governmental investigations may harm our operating results or
financial condition.
We are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business. Any litigation can be costly,
lengthy, and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results of complex legal
proceedings are difficult to predict. An unfavorable resolution of lawsuits or governmental
investigations could materially harm our business, operating results, or financial condition. For
additional information regarding certain of the matters in which we are involved, see Note 14 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements, subsection (f) “Legal Proceedings.”
Our operating results may be negatively impacted and damage to our reputation may occur due to the
production and sale of counterfeit versions of our products.
As is the case with leading products around the world, our products are subject to efforts by third
parties to produce counterfeit versions of our products. While we work diligently with law
enforcement authorities in various countries to block the manufacture of counterfeit goods and to
interdict their sale, and to detect counterfeit products in customer networks, and have succeeded in
prosecuting counterfeiters and their distributors, resulting in fines, imprisonment and restitution
to us, there can be no guarantee that such efforts will succeed. While counterfeiters often aim their
sales at customers who might not have otherwise purchased our products due to lack of verifiability
of origin and service, such counterfeit sales, to the extent they replace otherwise legitimate sales,
could negatively impact our operating results.
Changes in our provision for income taxes or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our
income tax returns could negatively impact our results.
Our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be negatively impacted by earnings
being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in
countries that have higher tax rates; by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and
liabilities; by changes to foreign-derived intangible income, global intangible low-tax income and
base erosion and anti-abuse tax, research and development capitalization and amortization, and
corporate alternative minimum tax laws, regulations, or interpretations thereof; by expiration of or
lapses in tax incentives; by transfer pricing adjustments, including the effect of acquisitions on
our legal structure; by tax effects of nondeductible compensation; by tax costs related to
intercompany realignments; by changes in accounting principles; or by changes in tax laws and
regulations, treaties, or interpretations thereof, including changes to the taxation of earnings of
our foreign subsidiaries, the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income, and the
foreign tax credit rules. Significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and
measurement attribute prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes. The
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), an international association comprised
of 38 countries, including the United States, has made changes, including a Pillar Two framework that
imposes a minimum tax rate of 15% in each taxing jurisdiction, and is contemplating additional
changes to numerous long-standing tax principles. There can be no assurance that these changes and
any contemplated changes if finalized, once adopted by countries, will not have an adverse impact on
our provision for income taxes. Further, as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital
investment actions and
 22 
Table of Contents
commitments, our income in certain countries was subject to reduced tax rates. Our failure to meet
these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes. In addition, we are subject
to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and
other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these
examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance
that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating
results and financial condition.
Our business and operations are especially subject to the risks of earthquakes, floods, and other
natural catastrophic events (including as a result of global climate change).
Our corporate headquarters, including certain of our research and development operations are located
in the Silicon Valley area of Northern California, a region known for seismic activity. Additionally,
a certain number of our facilities are located near rivers that have experienced flooding in the
past. Also certain of our customers, suppliers and logistics centers are located in regions that have
been or may be affected by earthquake, tsunami and flooding or other weather-related activity which
in the past has disrupted, and in the future could disrupt, the flow of supply chain components and
delivery of products. In addition, global climate change may result in significant natural disasters
occurring more frequently and/or with greater intensity, such as drought, wildfires, storms, sea-
level rise, changing precipitation, and flooding. We have not to date experienced a material event as
a result of these kinds of natural disasters; however, the occurrence of any such event in the future
could materially harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.
Terrorism, war, and other events may harm our business, operating results and financial condition.
The continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response thereto, or
any other current or future acts of terrorism, war (such as the on-going Russia-Ukraine war and the
Israel-Hamas war), and other events (such as economic sanctions, trade restrictions and reactions of
the governments, markets and the general public, including the sanctions and restrictions related to
the on-going Russia-Ukraine war) may cause further disruptions to the economies of the United States
and other countries and create further uncertainties or could otherwise negatively impact our
business, operating results, and financial condition. Likewise, events such as loss of infrastructure
and utilities services such as energy, transportation, or telecommunications could have similar
negative impacts. To the extent that such disruptions or uncertainties result in delays or
cancellations of customer orders or the manufacture or shipment of our products, our business,
operating results, and financial condition could be materially harmed.
There can be no assurance that our operating results and financial condition will not be negatively
impacted by our incurrence of debt.
As of the end of fiscal 2024, we have senior unsecured notes outstanding in an aggregate principal
amount of $20.3 billion that mature at specific dates from calendar year 2025 through 2064. We have
also established a commercial paper program under which we may issue short-term, unsecured commercial
paper notes on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of
$15.0 billion. We had $10.9 billion in commercial paper notes outstanding under this program as of
July 27, 2024. There can be no assurance that our incurrence of this debt or any future debt,
including any additional debt to refinance maturing debt, will be a better means of providing
liquidity to us than would our use of our existing cash resources. Further, we cannot be assured that
our maintenance of this indebtedness or incurrence of future indebtedness will not negatively impact
our operating results or financial condition. In addition, changes by any rating agency to our credit
rating can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities, as well
as the terms upon which we may borrow under our commercial paper program or future debt issuances.
Our reputation and/or business could be negatively impacted by ESG matters and/or our reporting of
such matters.
There is an increasing focus from regulators, certain investors, and other stakeholders concerning
environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) matters, both in the United States and internationally.
We communicate certain ESG-related initiatives, goals, and/or commitments regarding environmental
matters, diversity and inclusion, responsible sourcing and social investments, and other matters, in
our annual Purpose Report, on our website, in our filings with the SEC, and elsewhere. These
initiatives, goals, or commitments involve risks and uncertainties and could be difficult to achieve
and costly to implement. For example, in September 2021, we announced our goal to achieve net zero
across all scopes of greenhouse gas emissions by 2040, the achievement of which relies, in large
part, on the accuracy of our estimates and assumptions around the enhanced power efficiency of our
products, the adoption of renewable energy at customer and supplier sites, and the adoption of
certain of our products and services by our customers. We could fail to achieve, or be perceived to
fail to achieve, our 2040 net zero goal or other ESG-related initiatives, goals, or commitments. In
addition, we could be criticized for the timing, scope or nature of these initiatives, goals, or
commitments, or for any revisions to them. To the extent that our required and voluntary disclosures
about ESG matters increase, we could be criticized for the accuracy, adequacy, or completeness of
such disclosures. Our actual or perceived failure to achieve our ESG-related initiatives, goals, or
commitments could negatively impact our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business.

 Risks Related to Intellectual Property 
Our proprietary rights may prove difficult to enforce.
We generally rely on patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secret laws to establish and maintain
proprietary rights in our technology and products. Although we have been issued numerous patents and
other patent applications are currently pending, there can be no assurance that any of these patents
or other proprietary rights will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented or that our rights
will, in fact, provide competitive advantages to us. Furthermore, many key aspects of networking
technology are governed by industry-wide standards, which are usable by all market entrants. In
addition, there can be no assurance that patents will be issued from pending applications or that
claims allowed on any patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. In addition, the
laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the
laws of the United States. The outcome of any actions taken in these foreign countries may be
different than if such actions were determined under the laws of the United States. Although we are
not dependent on any individual patents or group of patents for particular segments of the business
for which we compete, if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights to the totality of the
features (including aspects of products protected other than by patent rights) in a market, we may
find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the substantial expense,
time, and effort required to create innovative products that have enabled us to be successful.
We may be found to infringe on intellectual property rights of others.
Third parties, including customers, have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate
litigation related to exclusive patent, copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property rights
to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us. These assertions have increased over
time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims assertions,
particularly in the United States. Because of the existence of a large number of patents in the
networking field, the secrecy of some pending patents, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents,
it is not economically practical or even possible to determine in advance whether a product or any of
its components infringes or will infringe on the patent rights of others. The asserted claims and/or
initiated litigation can include claims against us or our manufacturers, suppliers, or customers,
alleging infringement of their proprietary rights with respect to our existing or future products or
components of those products. Regardless of the merit of these claims, they can be time-consuming,
result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel, or require us to
develop a non-infringing technology or enter into license agreements. Where claims are made by
customers, resistance even to unmeritorious claims could damage customer relationships. There can be
no assurance that licenses will be available on acceptable terms and conditions, if at all, or that
our indemnification by our suppliers will be adequate to cover our costs if a claim were brought
directly against us or our customers. Furthermore, because of the potential for high court awards
that are not necessarily predictable, it is not unusual to find even arguably unmeritorious claims
settled for significant amounts. If any infringement or other intellectual property claim made
against us by any third party is successful, if we are required to indemnify a customer with respect
to a claim against the customer, or if we fail to develop non-infringing technology or license the
proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions, our business, operating results,
and financial condition could be materially harmed. For additional information regarding our
indemnification obligations, see Note 14(e) to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in
this report. Our exposure to risks associated with the use of intellectual property may be increased
as a result of acquisitions, as we have a lower level of visibility into the development process with
respect to such technology or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks. Further, in the
past, third parties have made infringement and similar claims after we have acquired technology that
had not been asserted prior to our acquisition.
We rely on the availability of third-party licenses.
Many of our products are designed to include software or other intellectual property licensed from
third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various
aspects of these products. There can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available
on acceptable terms, if at all. The inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain
such licenses or rights on favorable terms, or the need to engage in litigation regarding these
matters, could materially harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. Moreover,
the inclusion in our products of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties
on a nonexclusive basis could limit our ability to protect our proprietary rights in our products.

Risks Related to Cybersecurity, Privacy, and Regulatory Requirements
Cyber attacks, data breaches or other incidents impacting our solutions and IT environment may
disrupt our operations, harm our operating results and financial condition, and damage our reputation
or otherwise materially harm our business; and cyber attacks, data breaches or other incidents on our
customers’ or third-party providers’ networks, or in third-party products we use, could result in
claims of liability against us, give rise to legal and/or regulatory action, damage our reputation or
otherwise materially harm our business.
We experience cyber attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access on a regular basis to (i)
our products and services (together, our “solutions”) and (ii) the servers, data centers, networks,
systems, and cloud-based services operated or enabled by us, or by third parties upon which we rely,
on or through which our and third-party data are stored, processed, or can be accessed (collectively,
our “IT environment”). We anticipate continuing to be increasingly subject to such attempts as cyber
attacks become more sophisticated and difficult to predict and protect against. Despite our active
implementation of security and other measures, our solutions and IT environment have been, and
continue to be, vulnerable to cyber attacks, incidents, data breaches, malware, inadvertent error,
disruptions, failures, physical security breaches, tampering or other theft or misuse, including by
employees, contingent workers, and malicious actors. Additionally, nation-state actors or their
agents have in the past successfully attacked our IT environment and have also exploited
vulnerabilities in our solutions to carry out attacks, and we anticipate that these attacks and the
exploitation of vulnerabilities in our solutions will continue and may intensify during periods of
diplomatic or armed conflict. Further, a cyber attack or other incident could go undetected and
persist in our environments for extended periods. Cyber-related events have caused, and in the future
could result in, compromise to, the disruption of access to, or the operation of our solutions and IT
environment or those of our customers or third-party providers upon which we rely, or result in
confidential information stored on our systems or our customers’ or other third-party systems being
improperly accessed, processed, disclosed now (or in the future), or be lost or stolen. Efforts to
limit the ability of malicious actors to disrupt the operations of the Internet or undermine our
security efforts are costly to implement and may not be successful. Breaches of security in our IT
environment, our customers’ or third-party providers’ networks, or in third-party products we use,
regardless of whether the breach is attributable to a vulnerability in our solutions, a failure by us
to timely mitigate or apply a security fix for products we use that are found vulnerable, or a
failure to maintain the digital security infrastructure or security tools that protect the integrity
of our solutions and IT environment, could, in each case, result in claims of legal and/or regulatory
action against us, damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business. The occurrence of
a cyber attack, data breach or other incident could subject us to liability to our customers, data
subjects, suppliers, business partners, employees, and others, give rise to legal and/or regulatory
action, could damage our reputation or could otherwise negatively impact our business, any of which
could materially harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.
Vulnerabilities and critical security defects, prioritization decisions regarding remedying
vulnerabilities or security defects, failure of third-party providers to remedy vulnerabilities or
security defects, or customers not deploying security updates in a timely manner or deciding not to
upgrade our solutions could result in claims of liability against us, damage our reputation, or
otherwise materially harm our business.
The products and services (together, our “solutions”) we sell to customers, and the cloud-based
services operated or enabled by us, or by third parties upon which we rely, inevitably contain
vulnerabilities or security defects (despite our efforts to prevent and detect them through secure
development lifecycle practices, testing, and other means), which have not been remedied or cannot be
disclosed without compromising security. We also make prioritization decisions in determining which
vulnerabilities or security defects to fix and the timing of these fixes. Even when we prioritize a
vulnerability or security defect, in certain instances it has taken, and in the future could take,
time for us to develop a remedy and the remedy may ultimately be insufficient to fully fix the issue.
In addition, workarounds or other mitigation efforts in certain instances have not been, and in the
future may not be, available or sufficient to protect customers prior to a security update being made
available. Vulnerabilities can persist even after we have issued security updates if we have not
identified and addressed the root cause of a particular vulnerability, if customers have not
installed the most recent updates, if the attackers exploited the vulnerabilities before a security
update is applied to install additional malware to further compromise customers’ systems, or if a
previously patched vulnerability is inadvertently reintroduced due to a security regression during
future development. Additionally, customers may also need to test security updates before they can be
deployed which can delay implementation. When customers do not deploy security updates in a timely
manner, use solutions that are end of life and no longer receive security updates, or decide not to
upgrade to the latest versions of our solutions containing the security update, they are left
vulnerable. In addition, we rely on third-party providers of software and cloud-based services on
which our and third-party data is stored or processed, and we cannot control the timing at which
third-party providers remedy vulnerabilities, which could leave us vulnerable. Failure to comply with
internal security policies and standards, including secure development lifecycle practices, failure
to prevent or promptly mitigate vulnerabilities and security defects, prioritization errors in
remedying vulnerabilities or security defects, failure of third-party providers to remedy
vulnerabilities or security defects, or customers not deploying

security updates in a timely manner or deciding not to upgrade solutions could, in each case, result
in claims of legal and/or regulatory action against us, damage our reputation, or otherwise
materially harm our business.
Our actual or perceived failure to adequately protect personal data could result in claims of legal
and/or regulatory action against us, damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business.
Global privacy and data protection-related laws and regulations are evolving, extensive, and complex.
Compliance with these laws and regulations is difficult and costly. In addition, evolving legal
requirements restricting or controlling the collection, processing, or cross-border transmission of
data, including for regulation of cloud-based services, could materially affect our customers’
ability to use, and our ability to sell, our products and services. The interpretation and
application of these laws in some instances is uncertain, and our legal and regulatory obligations
are subject to frequent changes. For example, the European Union’s (“EU”) General Data Protection
Regulation (“GDPR”) applies to our activities conducted from an establishment in the EU or related to
products and services offered in the EU and imposes a range of compliance obligations regarding the
handling of personal data. Additionally, we are subject to California’s Consumer Privacy Act,
Singapore’s Personal Data Protection Act, and other laws, regulations and obligations that relate to
the handling of personal data. Our actual or perceived failure to comply with applicable laws and
regulations or other obligations relating to personal data, or to protect personal data from
unauthorized access, use, or other processing, could subject us to liability to our customers, data
subjects, suppliers, business partners, employees, and others, give rise to legal and/or regulatory
action, could damage our reputation or could otherwise negatively impact our business, any of which
could materially harm our operating results and financial condition.
Our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially harmed by evolving
regulatory uncertainty or obligations applicable to our products and services.
Changes in regulatory requirements applicable to the industries and sectors in which we operate, in
the United States and in other countries, could materially affect the sales and use of our products
and services. In particular, economic sanctions and changes to export and import control requirements
have impacted and may continue to impact our ability to sell and support our products and services in
certain jurisdictions. In addition, changes in telecommunications regulations could impact our
service provider customers’ purchase of our products and services, and they could also impact sales
of our own regulated offerings. Government procurement policies, priorities, regulations, technology
initiatives and/or other obligations often give rise to evolving privacy, cybersecurity, operational
resilience, or other requirements, and the failure or delay to meet and maintain such requirements
could negatively impact our business, including by limiting our ability to sell products and
services, directly or indirectly, to public sector, critical infrastructure and other customers.
Additional areas of uncertainty that could impact sales of our products and services include laws,
regulations, or customer procurement requirements related to encryption technology, data, artificial
intelligence, privacy, cybersecurity, operational resilience, environmental sustainability (including
climate change), human rights, product certification, product accessibility, country of origin, and
national security controls applicable to our supply chain. Changes in regulatory requirements or our
actual or perceived failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or other obligations could
materially harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.
 Risks Related to Ownership of Our Stock 
 Our stock price may be volatile. 
Historically, our common stock has experienced substantial price volatility, particularly as a result
of variations between our actual financial results and the published expectations of analysts and as
a result of announcements by our competitors and us. Furthermore, speculation in the press or
investment community about our strategic position, financial condition, results of operations,
business, security of our products, or significant transactions can cause changes in our stock price.
In addition, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have
affected the market price of many technology companies, in particular, and that have often been
unrelated to the operating performance of these companies. These factors, as well as general economic
and political conditions and the announcement of proposed and completed acquisitions or other
significant transactions, or any difficulties associated with such transactions, by us or our current
or potential competitors, may materially harm the market price of our common stock in the future.
Additionally, volatility, lack of positive performance in our stock price or changes to our overall
compensation program, including our stock incentive program, may negatively impact our ability to
retain key employees, virtually all of whom are compensated, in part, based on the performance of our
stock price.

 Item 1C. Cybersecurity 
We recognize the critical importance of maintaining the trust and confidence of our customers,
employees, and other stakeholders. To help mitigate the cybersecurity risks that we face, we maintain
processes for identifying, assessing, and managing such risks.
Our incident response functions, which include our Security and Trust Organization (“S&TO”) under the
leadership of our Chief Security and Trust Officer, have established internal policies, processes,
and procedures to monitor, detect, investigate, respond to, and escalate management of internal and
external cybersecurity threats and incidents. We maintain policies and procedures for the escalation
of cybersecurity incidents, assessed as potentially being or becoming material, to designated members
of our senior management for further assessment. We also, as necessary, inform our independent
registered public accounting firm of significant cybersecurity matters and any relevant developments.
To help identify, assess, and mitigate cybersecurity threats that we face to our business, S&TO, in
addition to its own capabilities, partners with Cisco’s Talos Threat Intelligence Group and third
parties, including governments and peer companies, to share and receive threat intelligence and other
information. S&TO actively monitors for and evaluates cybersecurity vulnerabilities, threats, and
incidents observable on the internet and the dark web. In addition to monitoring risks from threats
to our own business, we operate third-party risk management programs to help identify and manage
risks from cybersecurity threats arising from third-party suppliers and service providers on which we
rely. These programs leverage on-going security-focused risk assessments based on industry practices,
audits, and contractual requirements.
We strive to embed security into our products and services through the Cisco Secure Development
Lifecycle (CSDL). The CSDL introduces security and privacy considerations throughout the lifecycle of
our products and services. In addition, S&TO advises business units and functional areas on
addressing cybersecurity risks and monitors initiatives to mitigate and manage such risks over time.
Our business units or functional areas are responsible for managing risks and ensuring that security
policies and standards are implemented within the respective business unit or function. S&TO also
conducts mandatory cybersecurity training for our employees and provides employees with tools to
report suspected incidents.
S&TO engages third parties in connection with our cybersecurity risk management processes, including
cybersecurity consultants and auditors, to conduct evaluations of our IT security controls and
provide certifications for industry-standard security frameworks. In addition, we maintain a global
privacy program to assess and manage privacy risks related to how we are collecting, using, sharing,
and storing personal data, which is subject to assessment by an independent, third-party privacy
assessor.
Our Chief Security and Trust Officer, who reports to our Executive Vice President, Operations, works
collaboratively across our business to implement policies and procedures designed to protect our IT
environment and our products and services from cybersecurity threats, and to promptly respond to
cybersecurity incidents in accordance with our incident response policies and procedures. Our Chief
Security and Trust Officer has extensive cybersecurity experience and has served in various roles in
information technology and information security for over 25 years.
The Chief Security and Trust Officer provides regular reports on the status of cybersecurity risks,
priorities, and focus areas to our executive leadership team. In addition, information on
cybersecurity risks is further integrated into our broader enterprise risk management program through
our internal audit function, which incorporates such information in regular audits of our
cybersecurity and data protection controls and processes.
Our Board of Directors oversees risks related to cybersecurity threats to our business directly and
through its Audit Committee. The Audit Committee receives regular reports on cybersecurity risks,
priorities, and focus areas from our Chief Security and Trust Officer at least four times a year and
receives a live presentation at least twice a year. Our Board of Directors also regularly receives
updates from the Audit Committee on its oversight activities and, on occasion, receives updates
directly from our Chief Security and Trust Officer. Additionally, the Chief Security and Trust
Officer provides more frequent updates to the Board of Directors and Audit Committee if necessary due
to a cybersecurity threat, incident, or other development.
As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we do not believe our business, operating results,
or financial condition have been materially affected by cybersecurity risks, including as a result of
previously identified cybersecurity incidents. For more information on our cybersecurity related
risks, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
