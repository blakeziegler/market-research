Item 1. Business 
 General 
Cisco designs and sells a broad range of technologies that power the Internet. We are integrating our
platforms across networking, security, collaboration, applications and the cloud. These platforms are
designed to help our customers manage more users, devices and things connecting to their networks.
This will enable us to provide customers with a highly secure, intelligent platform for their digital
business.
We conduct our business globally and manage our business by geography. Our business is organized into
the following three geographic segments: Americas; Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA); and Asia
Pacific, Japan, and China (APJC).
Our products and technologies are grouped into the following categories: Infrastructure Platforms;
Applications; Security and Other Products. In addition to our product offerings, we provide a broad
range of service offerings, including technical support services and advanced services. Increasingly,
we are delivering our technologies through software and services. Our customers include businesses of
all sizes, public institutions, governments, and service providers, including large webscale
providers. These customers often look to us as a strategic partner to help them use information
technology (IT) to differentiate themselves and drive positive business outcomes.
At our annual meeting of shareholders held on December 10, 2020, shareholders voted to approve
changing our state of incorporation from California to Delaware. The reincorporation became effective
on January 25, 2021. Our headquarters are in San Jose, California. The mailing address of our

 Strategy and Priorities 
As our customers add billions of new connections to their enterprises, and as more applications move
to a multicloud environment, the network becomes even more critical. Our customers are navigating
change at an unprecedented pace and our mission is to shape the future of the Internet by inspiring
new possibilities for them by helping transform their infrastructure, expand applications and
analytics, address their security needs, and empower their teams. We believe that our customers are
looking for outcomes that are data-driven and provide meaningful business value through automation,
security, and analytics across private, hybrid, and multicloud environments.
We are focusing on four customer priorities: Reimagine Applications, Power of Hybrid Work,
Transforming Infrastructure and Secure the Enterprise.
Reimagine Applications
In our view, over the next several years, customers will be increasingly writing modern software
applications that can run on any hybrid cloud, and will be adding billions of connections to their
environments. Customers will need to be able to build
 1

applications quickly, deploy them nearly anywhere, monitor experiences, and act in real time.
We believe we are uniquely positioned to enable successful business outcomes for customers in hybrid
and multicloud environments. In our view, networks are increasingly critical to business success and
we believe our customers will benefit from the insights and intelligence that we are making
accessible through our highly differentiated platforms.
We are continuing our commitment to deliver full stack observability from the application to the
infrastructure to give our customers greater insights that enable faster, better decision making. We
are doing this through adding key elements to our portfolio, such as: infrastructure optimization
with Intersight, network monitoring with technology from our acquisition of ThousandEyes, application
performance monitoring with AppDynamics, as well as our security innovations.
Power of Hybrid Work
Our customers’ communications continue to evolve as we move to a digital, cloud-based world. As our
customers’ people are an important competitive advantage to them, their teams need effective and
simple ways to work better together and to interact with their customers to build better
relationships and increase collaboration. As an example, we believe our collaboration portfolio,
which includes our subscription-based Webex conferencing platform, is at the center of our customers’
strategy for enabling their teams to be more productive and secure.
With the future of work being hybrid, we are focused on delivering highly secure collaboration
experiences regardless of whether workers are physically at home or in the office. During fiscal
2021, we have added a significant number of new features, including digital signage, touchless calls,
room capacity alerts, and environmental sensors to help enable a safer return to the office. We also
extended our Webex suite of devices through our new desk camera and desk hub solutions.
Transforming Infrastructure
In an increasingly digital and connected world, our customers are looking to modernize and transform
their infrastructure. Our strategy began with Software-Defined Access (SD-Access) technology, one of
our leading enterprise architectures and continued with the launch of our Catalyst 9000 series of
switches.
Since the initial launch, we have continued to transform our enterprise access portfolio by bringing
together several technologies to form the only integrated architecture with built-in simplicity,
automation and security at the foundation. This architecture is designed to enable our customers to
securely connect their users and devices to applications and data over any network, to applications
and data, no matter where they are.
We have introduced several innovations that extend our networking capabilities to wireless and
enterprise routing products, including Software-Defined Wide Area Network (SD-WAN) and Internet of
Things (IoT) edge platforms. Our SD-WAN solutions are designed to provide direct branch to cloud
connectivity, enabling the workforce to access their software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications and
workloads in an optimized and highly secure manner. We have continued to expand our SD-WAN offering,
through our Cloud OnRamp integrations with several webscale providers to deliver predictable and
highly secure application experiences.
To further our innovation in this area, we are applying the latest technologies, such as machine
learning and advanced analytics, to operate and enhance network capabilities. These network product
offerings are designed to enable customers to detect cybersecurity threats, even in encrypted
traffic. As such, we have created, in our view, the only network that is designed for security while
maintaining privacy.
Our customers are operating in multicloud environments with private, public and hybrid clouds. For
the data center, our strategy is to deliver multicloud architectures that bring policy and
operational consistency, regardless of where applications or data reside, by extending our
Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) and our hyperconverged offerings.
In fiscal 2020, we announced details of our technology strategy for the Internet for the Future aimed
at addressing the broad adoption of multicloud and application environments. We continue to make
significant investments in the development of software, silicon and optics — which we believe are the
building blocks for the Internet for the Future.
We introduced Cisco Silicon One, a single unified silicon architecture, as well as the Cisco 8000
carrier-class router family built on Cisco Silicon One and our operating system, Cisco IOS XR7. We
have also expanded our Cisco Silicon One platform from a routing focused solution to one which
addresses the webscale switching market. We also launched a new routed optical networking solution
integrating our routers and pluggable optics from our recent acquisition of Acacia, which further
helps to deliver cost savings to our customers.
Secure the Enterprise
With the rapid growth in modern applications, more distributed work environments, and increasing
cyber-attacks, we believe every organization requires new or enhanced security architectures. Our
security strategy is focused on delivering a simple and
 2 
Table of Contents
effective cyber-security architecture combining network, cloud and endpoint-based solutions that
recognizes the critical importance of data privacy.
Our comprehensive security portfolio offers simplified protection for any workload on any cloud while
minimizing the attack surface and automating security policies across an organization’s hybrid cloud
footprint. This extends to our secure access service edge (SASE) framework and Zero Trust
architecture, where we have developed a cloud-delivered stack across Umbrella, a secure Internet
gateway, Meraki, SD-WAN, and Viptela. We are also delivering unified detection and response
capabilities built on Cisco SecureX, our new cloud-native platform, which is a built-in platform that
connects our Cisco Secure portfolio and our customers’ infrastructure.
Our strategy is to help our customers connect, secure, and automate in order to accelerate their
digital agility in a cloud-first world. To execute on our strategy and address our customer
priorities, we are focusing on the following six strategic pillars:
• Secure, Agile Networks — Build networking solutions with built-in simplicity, security, agility and
automation that can be consumed as-a-service.
• Optimized Application Experiences — Enabling greater speed, agility and scale of cloud-native
applications.
• Hybrid Work — Deliver highly secure access, a safer workplace and collaboration experiences for the
hybrid workforce.
• Internet for the Future — Transform connectivity by efficiently meeting the ever-growing demand for
low-latency and higher speeds.
• End-to-End Security — Build simple, integrated, and high efficacy end-to-end security solutions,
delivered on-premise or in the cloud.
• Capabilities at the Edge — Develop new capabilities for a distributed world while enhancing the
developer experience and extending enterprise and carrier networks.
We are also accelerating our efforts to enable the delivery of network functionality as a service as
our customers increasingly want to consume our technologies in flexible ways. We have made the
initial step with our new as-a-service portfolio, Cisco Plus, and our first offer, Cisco Plus hybrid
cloud, which combines our data center compute, networking and storage portfolio. Cisco Plus includes
our plans to deliver networking-as-a-service, which is designed to unify networking, security and
observability across access, wide area network (WAN), and cloud domains.
 Transforming our Business Model 
We are transforming our offerings to meet the evolving needs of our customers. Historically, our
various networking technology products have aligned with their respective product categories.
However, increasingly our offerings are crossing multiple product categories. As our core networking
offerings evolve, we expect we will add more common software features across our core networking
platforms. We are increasing the amount of software offerings that we provide and the proportion of
subscription software offerings. We have various software offerings that fall into the broad
categories of subscription arrangements, including SaaS and term licenses, and perpetual licenses.
As part of the transformation of our business, we continued to make strides during fiscal 2021 to
develop and sell more software and subscription-based offerings. We are also focused on the entire
customer lifecycle to drive expansion and renewals. We will continue to invest in network-as-a-
service offerings to provide our customers with flexibility in how they want to utilize our
technologies.
For a discussion of the risks associated with our strategy, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” including
the risk factor entitled “We depend upon the development of new products and services, and
enhancements to existing products and services, and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging
technological trends and customers’ changing needs, our operating results and market share may
suffer.” For information regarding sales of our major products and services, see Note 19 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Security product category primarily includes our network security, cloud and email security,
identity and access management, advanced threat protection, and unified threat management products.
Leveraging the built-in Cisco SecureX platform, we provide interoperability with customers’ security
infrastructure, including third-party technologies. This results in unified visibility, automation
and stronger defenses.
Security continues to be a leading priority for our customers, regardless of size or industry. At the
core of our strategy is addressing their number one concern: the complexity of security. We have
built SecureX into our Security products to help our customers connect our integrated security
portfolio and existing security infrastructure to provide simplicity, visibility, and efficiency. We
have also delivered Zero Trust for the workforce, workplace and workloads to help address the
security challenges associated with the transition to cloud and remote work.
In fiscal 2021, we continued to invest and innovate in solutions that enable an increasingly hybrid
workforce, support our customers’ transition to the cloud and help mitigate attackers’ evolving
threats and methods. We enhanced our offerings in SASE by expanding our SASE architecture while
simplifying the offering for customers, combining network and security functionality in a single,
cloud-native service to help secure access wherever users and applications reside. We continued to
enhance our comprehensive zero trust framework, introducing passwordless authentication by Duo
Security.
 Other Products 
Our Other Products category primarily consists of our emerging technologies products.
 Services 
In addition to our product offerings, we provide a broad range of service and support options for our
customers. Our overall service and support offerings are combined into one organization, Customer
Experience, that is responsible for the end-to-end customer experience.
Our support and maintenance services help our customers ensure their products operate efficiently,
remain available, and benefit from the most up-to-date system and application software. These
services help customers protect their network investments, manage risk, and minimize downtime for
systems running mission-critical applications. A key example is Cisco Smart Services, which leverages
the intelligence from the installed base of our products and customer connections to protect and
optimize network investments for our customers and partners. We have expanded these offerings from
traditional hardware support to include software, solutions, and premium support.
We also provide comprehensive advisory services that are focused on responsive, preventive, and
consultative support of our technologies for specific networking needs. We are investing in and
expanding advisory services in the areas of software, cloud, security, and analytics, which reflects
our strategy of selling customer outcomes. We are focused on three priorities: utilizing technology
advisory services to drive higher product and services; assessment and migration services providing
the tools, expertise and methodologies to enable our customers to migrate to new technology
platforms; and providing optimization services aligned with customers’ business expectations.

 Customers and Markets 
Many factors influence the IT, collaboration, and networking requirements of our customers. These
include the size of the organization, number and types of technology systems, geographic location,
and business applications deployed throughout the customer’s network. Our customer base is not
limited to any specific industry, geography, or market segment. In each of the past three fiscal
years, no single customer accounted for 10% or more of revenue. Our customers primarily operate in
the following markets: enterprise, commercial, service provider, and public sector.
 Enterprise 
Enterprise businesses are large regional, national, or global organizations with multiple locations
or branch offices and typically employ 1,000 or more employees. Many enterprise businesses have
unique IT, collaboration, and networking needs within a multivendor environment. We offer service and
support packages, financing, and managed network services, primarily through our service provider
partners. We sell these products through a network of third-party application and technology vendors
and channel partners, as well as selling directly to these customers.
 Commercial 
Within the commercial market, we define large businesses as organizations which typically have fewer
than 1,000 employees. We sell to the larger, or midmarket, customers within the commercial market
through a combination of our direct sales force and channel partners. These customers typically
require the latest advanced technologies that our enterprise customers demand, but with less
complexity. Small businesses, or organizations with fewer than 100 employees, require information
technologies and communications products that are easy to configure, install, and maintain. We sell
to these smaller organizations within the commercial market primarily through channel partners.
 Service Providers 
Service providers offer data, voice, video, and mobile/wireless services to businesses, governments,
utilities, and consumers worldwide. The service provider market includes regional, national, and
international wireline carriers, webscale operators as well as Internet, cable, and wireless
providers. We also include media, broadcast, and content providers within our service provider
market, as the lines in the telecommunications industry continue to blur between traditional network-
based, content-based and application-based services. Service providers use a variety of our products
and services for their own networks. In addition, many service providers use Cisco data center,
virtualization, and collaboration technologies to offer managed or Internet-based services to their
business customers. Compared with other customers, service providers are more likely to require
network design, deployment, and support services because of the greater scale and higher complexity
of their networks, whose requirements are addressed, we believe, by our architectural approach.
 Public Sector 
The public sector market includes federal, state and local governments, as well as educational
institution customers. Many public sector customers have unique IT, collaboration, and networking
needs within a multi-vendor environment. We sell to public sector customers through a network of
third-party application and technology vendors, channel partners, as well as through direct sales.
 Sales Overview 
As of the end of fiscal 2021, our worldwide sales and marketing functions consisted of approximately
25,000 employees, including managers, sales representatives, and technical support personnel. We have
field sales offices in approximately 90 countries, and we sell our products and services both
directly and through a variety of channels with support from our salesforce. A substantial portion of
our products and services is sold through channel partners, and the remainder is sold through direct
sales. Channel partners include systems integrators, service providers, other resellers, and
distributors.
Systems integrators and service providers typically sell directly to end users and often provide
system installation, technical support, professional services, and other support services in addition
to network equipment sales. Systems integrators also typically integrate our products into an overall
solution. Some service providers are also systems integrators.
Distributors may hold inventory and sell to systems integrators, service providers, and other
resellers. We refer to sales through distributors as our two-tier system of sales to the end
customer. Revenue from two-tier distributors is recognized based on a sell-in method. These
distributors may be given business terms that allow them to return a limited portion of inventory,
receive credits for changes in selling prices, receive certain rebates, and participate in various
cooperative marketing programs.
For information regarding risks related to our sales channels, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” including
the risk factors entitled “Disruption of or changes in our distribution model could harm our sales
and margins” and “Inventory management relating to our sales to our two-tier distribution channel is
complex, and excess inventory may harm our gross margins.”

For information regarding risks relating to our international operations, see “Item 1A. Risk
Factors,” including the risk factors entitled “Our operating results may be adversely affected by
unfavorable economic and market conditions and the uncertain geopolitical environment;” “Entrance
into new or developing markets exposes us to additional competition and will likely increase demands
on our service and support operations;” “Due to the global nature of our operations, political or
economic changes or other factors in a specific country or region could harm our operating results
and financial condition;” “We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could
negatively impact our financial results and cash flows;” and “Cyber-attacks, data breaches or malware
may disrupt our operations, harm our operating results and financial condition, and damage our
reputation or otherwise materially harm our business; and cyber-attacks or data breaches on our
customers’ networks, or in cloud-based services provided by or enabled by us, could result in claims
of liability against us, damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business,” among
others.
Our service offerings complement our products through a range of consulting, technical, project,
quality, and software maintenance services, including 24-hour online and telephone support through
technical assistance centers.
 Financing Arrangements 
We provide financing arrangements for certain qualified customers to build, maintain, and upgrade
their networks. We believe customer financing is a competitive advantage in obtaining business,
particularly for those customers involved in significant infrastructure projects. Our financing
arrangements include the following:
 Leases: 
 • Sales-type 
 • Direct financing 
 • Operating 
 Loans 
 Financed service contracts 
 Channels financing arrangements 
 End-user financing arrangements 
 Acquisitions, Investments, and Alliances 
The markets in which we compete require a wide variety of technologies, products, and capabilities.
Our growth strategy is based on the components of innovation, which we sometimes refer to as “build,
buy, partner, invest, and co-develop.” This five-prong approach to how we innovate can be summarized
as follows:
 Build Working within Cisco, with the developer community, or with customers 
 Buy Acquiring or divesting, depending on goals 
 Partner Strategically partnering to further build out the business 
 Invest Making investments in areas where technology is in its infancy or where there is no 
 dominant technology 
 Co-develop Developing new solutions with multi-party teams that may include customers, channel 
 partners, startups, independent software vendors, and academics 
 Acquisitions 
We have acquired many companies, and we expect to make future acquisitions. Mergers and acquisitions
of high-technology companies are inherently risky, especially if the acquired company has yet to
generate revenue. No assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be
successful or will not materially adversely affect our financial condition or operating results.
Prior acquisitions have resulted in a wide range of outcomes, from successful introduction of new
products and technologies to an inability to do so. The risks associated with acquisitions are more
fully discussed in “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” including the risk factor entitled “We have made and
expect to continue to make acquisitions that could disrupt our operations and harm our operating
results.”
 Investments in Privately Held Companies 
We make investments in privately held companies that develop technology or provide services that are
complementary to our products or that provide strategic value. The risks associated with these
investments are more fully discussed in “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” including the risk factor entitled
“We are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest
rates; impairment of our investments could harm our earnings.”

Table of Contents
 Strategic Alliances 
We pursue strategic alliances with other companies in areas where collaboration can produce industry
advancement and accelerate new markets. The objectives and goals of a strategic alliance can include
one or more of the following: technology exchange, product development, joint sales and marketing, or
new market creation. Companies with which we have added or expanded strategic alliances during fiscal
2021 and in recent years include Apple Inc., Equinix Inc., Google LLC, International Business
Machines Corporation, Microsoft Corporation, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., and Amazon Web Services
LLC, among others.
Companies with which we have strategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas, and
in our view this trend may increase. The risks associated with our strategic alliances are more fully
discussed in “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” including the risk factor entitled “If we do not successfully
manage our strategic alliances, we may not realize the expected benefits from such alliances and we
may experience increased competition or delays in product development.”
 Competition 
We compete in the networking and communications equipment markets, providing products and services
designed to transport, and help secure data, voice, and video traffic across cloud, private and
public networks and the Internet. These market factors represent a competitive threat to us. We
compete with numerous vendors in each product category. The overall number of our competitors
providing niche product solutions may increase. Also, the identity and composition of competitors may
change as we increase our activity in newer product areas, and in key priority and growth areas. As
we continue to expand globally, we may see new competition in different geographic regions. In
particular, we have experienced price-focused competition from competitors in Asia, especially from
China, and we anticipate this will continue.
Our competitors (in each case relative to only some of our products or services) include: Amazon Web
Services LLC; Arista Networks, Inc.; Broadcom Inc.; CommScope Holding Company, Inc.; Check Point
Software Technologies Ltd.; CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.; Dell Technologies Inc.; Dynatrace Inc.; F5
Networks, Inc.; FireEye, Inc.; Fortinet, Inc.; Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Company; Huawei
Technologies Co., Ltd.; Juniper Networks, Inc.; Lenovo Group Limited; LogMeIn, Inc.; Microsoft
Corporation; New Relic, Inc.; Nokia Corporation; Nutanix, Inc.; Palo Alto Networks, Inc.;
RingCentral, Inc.; Ubiquiti Inc.; VMware, Inc.; Zoom Video Communications, Inc.; and Zscaler, Inc.;
among others.
Some of our competitors compete across many of our product lines, while others are primarily focused
in a specific product area. Barriers to entry are relatively low, and new ventures to create products
that do or could compete with our products are regularly formed. In addition, some of our competitors
may have greater resources, including technical and engineering resources, than we do. As we expand
into new markets, we will face competition not only from our existing competitors but also from other
competitors, including existing companies with strong technological, marketing, and sales positions
in those markets. We also sometimes face competition from resellers and distributors of our products.
Companies with which we have strategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas, and
this trend may increase. For example, the enterprise data center is undergoing a fundamental
transformation arising from the convergence of technologies, including computing, networking,
storage, and software, that previously were segregated. Due to several factors, including the
availability of highly scalable and general purpose microprocessors, application-specific integrated
circuits (ASICs) offering advanced services, standards-based protocols, cloud computing and
virtualization, the convergence of technologies within the enterprise data center is spanning
multiple, previously independent, technology segments. Also, some of our current and potential
competitors for enterprise data center business have made acquisitions, or announced new strategic
alliances, designed to position them to provide end-to-end technology solutions for the enterprise
data center. As a result of all of these developments, we face greater competition in the development
and sale of enterprise data center technologies, including competition from entities that are among
our long-term strategic alliance partners. Companies that are strategic alliance partners in some
areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors, thereby reducing their
business with us.
The principal competitive factors in the markets in which we presently compete and may compete in the
future include the ability to sell successful business outcomes; the ability to provide a broad range
of networking and communications products and services; product performance; price; the ability to
introduce new products, including providing continuous new customer value and products with price-
performance advantages; the ability to reduce production costs; the ability to provide value-added
features such as security, reliability, and investment protection; conformance to standards; market
presence; the ability to provide financing; and disruptive technology shifts and new business models.
We also face competition from customers to which we license or supply technology and suppliers from
which we transfer technology. The inherent nature of networking requires interoperability. As such,
we must cooperate and, at the same time, compete with many companies. Any inability to effectively
manage these complicated relationships with customers, suppliers, and strategic alliance partners
could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition and
accordingly affect our chances of success.

 Research and Development 
We regularly introduce new products and features to address the requirements of our markets. We
allocate our research and development budget among our product categories, which consist of
Infrastructure Platforms, Applications, Security, and Other Product technologies. Our research and
development expenditures are applied generally to all product areas, with specific areas of focus
being identified from time to time. Recent areas of increased focus include our networking
technologies (which encompasses switching, routing, and wireless technologies within Infrastructure
Platforms), conferencing, security, and analytics products. Our expenditures for research and
development costs were expensed as incurred.
The industry in which we compete is subject to rapid technological developments, evolving standards,
changes in customer requirements, and new product introductions and enhancements. As a result, our
success depends, in part, on our ability, on a cost-effective and timely basis, to continue to
enhance our existing products and to develop and introduce new products that improve performance and
reduce total cost of ownership. To achieve these objectives, our management and engineering personnel
work with customers to identify and respond to customer needs, as well as with other innovators of
Internet networking products, including universities, laboratories, and corporations. We also expect
to continue to make acquisitions and strategic investments, where appropriate, to provide us with
access to new technologies. Nonetheless, there can be no assurance that we will be able to
successfully develop products to address new customer requirements and technological changes or that
those products will achieve market acceptance.
 Manufacturing 
We rely on contract manufacturers for our manufacturing needs. We presently use a variety of
independent third-party companies to provide services related to printed-circuit board assembly, in-
circuit test, product repair, and product assembly. Proprietary software in electronically
programmable memory chips is used to configure products that meet customer requirements and to
maintain quality control and security. The manufacturing process enables us to configure the hardware
and software in unique combinations to meet a wide variety of individual customer requirements. The
manufacturing process also uses automated testing equipment and burn-in procedures, as well as
comprehensive inspection, testing, and statistical process controls, which are designed to help
ensure the quality and reliability of our products. The manufacturing processes and procedures are
generally certified to International Organization for Standardization 9001 standards.
Our arrangements with contract manufacturers generally provide for quality, cost, and delivery
requirements, as well as manufacturing process terms, such as continuity of supply; inventory
management; flexibility regarding capacity, quality, and cost management; oversight of manufacturing;
and conditions for use of our intellectual property. We have not entered into any significant long-
term contracts with any manufacturing service provider. We generally have the option to renew
arrangements on an as-needed basis. These arrangements generally do not commit us to purchase any
particular amount or any quantities beyond amounts covered by orders or forecasts that we submit
covering discrete periods of time.
 Patents, Intellectual Property, and Licensing 
We seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products through the
use of patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secret laws. We have a program to file applications
for and obtain patents, copyrights, and trademarks in the United States and in selected foreign
countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate. We also seek to maintain our
trade secrets and confidential information by nondisclosure policies and through the use of
appropriate confidentiality agreements. We have obtained a substantial number of patents and
trademarks in the United States and in other countries. There can be no assurance, however, that the
rights obtained can be successfully enforced against infringing products in every jurisdiction.
Although we believe the protection afforded by our patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets
has value, the rapidly changing technology in the networking industry and uncertainties in the legal
process make our future success dependent primarily on the innovative skills, technological
expertise, and management abilities of our employees rather than on the protection afforded by
patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws.
Many of our products are designed to include software or other intellectual property licensed from
third parties. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various
aspects of our products, we believe, based upon past experience and standard industry practice, that
such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. Nonetheless, there can be
no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Our
inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on
favorable terms, or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters, could have a material
adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Moreover, inclusion in
our products of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive
basis can limit our ability to protect our proprietary rights in our products.

The industry in which we compete is characterized by rapidly changing technology, a large number of
patents, and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property
rights. There can be no assurance that our patents and other proprietary rights will not be
challenged, invalidated, or circumvented; that others will not assert intellectual property rights to
technologies that are relevant to us; or that our rights will give us a competitive advantage. In
addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same
extent as the laws of the United States. The risks associated with patents and intellectual property
are more fully discussed in “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” including the risk factors entitled “Our
proprietary rights may prove difficult to enforce,” “We may be found to infringe on intellectual
property rights of others,” and “We rely on the availability of third-party licenses.”
 Environmental Sustainability 
Sustainability and protecting the environment are both top priorities for Cisco. We have set long-
term goals to address the environmental impacts from our products and business operations.
We strive to reduce the impacts of our operations and supply chain, help our customers decrease
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and support our communities experiencing direct effects of a changing
climate by, among others:
• Continuing to invest in renewable energy, including investments in solar and wind energy;
• Designing our products and packaging for reuse, repair, recycling, and resource efficiency and
managing our equipment for multiple lifecycles;
• Enhancing our Webex and other remote collaboration tools;
• Investing in projects to improve the efficiency of our offices, labs, and data centers worldwide;
• Working with our component suppliers, manufacturing partners, and logistic providers to reduce
emissions and set targets for absolute GHG emissions reductions;
• Helping our employees to engage with events and opportunities to raise awareness and create a sense
of community around sustainability; and
• Providing critical connectivity in the aftermath of natural disasters.
 Talent and Culture 
At Cisco, we value our people, our technology, and changing the world for the better with a focus on
creating a more inclusive future. Our goal is to attract, retain, and develop talent in order to help
our customers connect, secure and automate to accelerate their digital agility in a cloud-first
world. Our relationship with our employees is one of mutual benefit, our employees bring talent and
ingenuity to everything we do. In turn, we provide employees meaningful careers and development
opportunities. As a testament to this, Cisco has been named as the number one place to work on the
“World’s Best Workplaces List” by Great Places to Work and Fortune Magazine for 2019 and 2020.
As of July 31, 2021, we had approximately 79,500 full-time employees and they are categorized as
follows:
We have a responsibility to support our employees through times of change and enable them to be their
best. We do this by fostering a Conscious Culture. Living a Conscious Culture requires us to act with
dignity, respect, fairness, and equity in each of our interactions with one another, building a
culture that allows us to become a catalyst for social change. By intentionally creating and
cultivating an inclusive work environment where employees can thrive, we believe Cisco is helping to
bring about a better world.

Inclusion & Diversity
Inclusion and diversity are core components in our Conscious Culture. Inclusivity is our strength and
our priority. We want every employee to feel valued, respected, and heard. We are prioritizing
inclusion and diversity across the company, recognizing that connecting people of all experiences and
backgrounds allows us to innovate and collaborate. In order to continue accelerating diversity and
finding extraordinary talent, we have designed a framework that includes: introducing new tools and
technologies to help accurately map the talent market, creating job roles that attract highly
qualified diverse candidates, and expanding the diversity within our interview panels.
We currently have a total of 29 Inclusive Communities comprised of 11 Employee Resource Organizations
and 18 Employee Networks supporting full-spectrum diversity globally, including gender, ethnicity,
race, orientation, age, ability, veteran status, religion, culture, background, as well as varied
experiences, strengths, and perspectives. These thriving communities continue to be a source of
strength and support for employees, and they help to foster a more conscious culture by providing
opportunities for proximity and learning.
Cisco has signed the CEO Action for Diversity and Inclusion Pledge. The CEO Action for Diversity &
Inclusion Pledge is a CEO-driven business commitment to drive measurable action and meaningful change
in advancing diversity, equity and inclusion in the workplace. We are delivering on this pledge by
accelerating full-spectrum diversity — including gender, age, race, ethnicity, orientation, ability,
nationality, religion, veteran status, background, culture, experience, strengths and perspectives.
At Cisco, it starts at the top: 46% of our Executive Leadership Team (ELT) are women and 54% are
diverse in terms of gender or ethnicity.
We publish certain gender diversity and ethnic diversity workforce data annually. Across our global
company, we have driven broad improvements in overall workforce diversity. Based on our annual fiscal
2020 data, our global employee base was 27% female and 73% male, and our U.S. employee base was
comprised of the following ethnicities: 51.8% White/Caucasian, 36.5% Asian, 5.8% Hispanic/Latino,
4.1% African American/Black, 1.4% two or more races (Not Hispanic or Latino), and 0.4% additional
groups (including American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander).
With respect to social justice, Cisco is taking a stand and partnering across the globe to multiply
our positive impact throughout our communities. In September 2020, we announced our Social Justice
Beliefs & Actions, which is our blueprint for how Cisco will show up when we see inequality and
injustice in the world.
This work is part of a plan for Cisco to drive transformational, generational impact for vulnerable
communities. Our Inclusive Future Action Office helps drive progress and excellence in our strategic
actions in this area, which are designed to address the broader ecosystem including our employees,
partners, customers and suppliers.
At present, our Inclusive Future Action Office is focused on driving impacts through our strategic
actions in the African American/Black community, but these actions will be the blueprint for how we
help address inequity in communities around the world in the future. We are creating actions that can
be replicated and scaled and are designed to cover the full spectrum of diversity, inclusive of
gender, generation, race, ethnicity, orientation, ability, nationality and background - the
foundation of our Conscious Culture.
Compensation and Benefits
Our total compensation philosophy is designed to attract, reward & retain talent. It provides market
competitive, performance-based compensation aligned with each employee’s contribution and impact to
the value we drive to our customers, partners and stockholders. We reward and recognize our employees
for effecting innovation, collaboration, profitability, and growth within our geographies, product
lines, and functions.
Cisco has always been committed to compensating our employees fairly and equitably. We are a founding
signer of the White House Equal Pay Pledge and the Parity.org pledge, and we are leading the charge
to make fair pay a reality for all employees through the Employers for Pay Equity Consortium. We have
also introduced an innovative and inclusive framework that provides us powerful analytics to evaluate
our complex compensation system. For example, by using these powerful analytics, we are able to test
for pay parity on a regular basis, and when gaps are found, we strive to correct them.
Health & Well-being
We have an ongoing commitment to focus on the health, safety, and well-being of our employees. We
provide our employees and their families high-quality, flexible and convenient benefits and resources
for their physical, mental, and financial well-being. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic,
employees have continually had to focus on how to balance careers and personal lives, all while
managing their own physical, emotional, and financial health. During fiscal 2021, most of our global
workforce was working from home. In addition, we are moving towards a hybrid work model, giving our
employees the flexibility to work offsite or onsite Cisco locations. We developed a COVID-19 response
and recovery strategy with a focus on both physical and mental health, recognizing the need to create
an environment where employees can speak openly about
 11 
Table of Contents
mental health. In fiscal 2021, we continued to offer employees “A Day for Me,” which were paid days
off that allowed for each individual to recharge and rest.
Employee Development
We believe in open-ended, self-directed learning, understanding that each individual knows what
skills and resources they need to succeed. We encourage employees to explore job roles outside of
their daily work and encourage everyone to harness their strengths and improve the way we all work.
Employees choose their own path and we support that choice by providing them tools and resources to
help them achieve their career goals.
Employee Engagement
We believe that strong communication is key in our Conscious Culture. This communication includes
regular, virtual all hands, which we refer to as a “Cisco Check-In,” and weekly team leader check-
ins, which we refer to as a “Team Space Check-In.” Our regular virtual Cisco Check-Ins were initially
launched with a focus on sharing medical information at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Cisco
Check-Ins have since evolved into a forum where we can discuss much more with our employees, from
business updates to social justice to physical and mental health.
In fiscal 2021, we have seen high level of employee engagement. For example, there were approximately
2 million Team Space Check-Ins by our employees in fiscal 2021, reflecting 85% of employees
submitting Team Space Check-Ins. Employees also participate in our global Engagement Pulse Survey and
the Real Deal Survey. These surveys allow our employees to provide confidential feedback on our
culture, company strategy and trust in their direct leaders.

 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
Set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the SEC are
descriptions of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially
from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report.
 Risks Related to our Business and Industry 
Our business, results of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected and could in
the future be materially adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting containment measures have caused economic and financial
disruptions globally, including in most of the regions in which we sell our products and services and
conduct our business operations. In the second half of fiscal 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic had an
impact on our financial results and business operations, with a significant impact in the third
quarter of fiscal 2020 on our supply chain where we saw manufacturing challenges and component
constraints. We continue to address these supply chain challenges and cost impacts, which we expect
will continue at least through the first half of fiscal 2022 and potentially into the second half of
fiscal 2022. The magnitude and duration of the disruption, its continuing impact on us, and resulting
decline in global business activity is uncertain. These disruptions include the unprecedented actions
taken to try to contain the pandemic such as travel bans and restrictions, business closures, and
social distancing measures, such as quarantines and shelter-in-place orders.
The COVID-19 pandemic and the responsive measures taken in many countries have adversely affected and
could in the future materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial
condition. Shelter-in-place orders and other measures, including work-from-home and other policies
implemented to protect workers, has and could in the future impact our supply chain. Such disruptions
may continue, or worsen, in the future. In addition, current and future restrictions or disruptions
of transportation, such as reduced availability of air transport, port closures, and increased border
controls or closures, can also impact our ability to meet customer demand and could materially
adversely affect us. Our customers have also experienced, and may continue to experience, disruptions
in their operations, which can result in delayed, reduced, or canceled orders, and increased
collection risks, and which may adversely affect our results of operations. The COVID-19 pandemic may
also result in long-term changes in customer needs for our products and services in various sectors,
along with IT-related capital spending reductions, or shifts in spending focus, that could materially
adversely affect us if we are unable to adjust our product and service offerings to match customer
needs.
The recent shift to a remote working environment also creates challenges. For example, governmental
lockdowns, restrictions or new regulations has and could in the future impact the ability of our
employees and vendors to work with the same speed and productivity in certain areas, even as other
areas do not see negative impact. The extent and/or duration of ongoing workforce
 13 
Table of Contents
restrictions and limitations could impact our ability to enhance, develop and support existing
products and services, and hold product sales and marketing events to the extent we were able to
previously. In addition, malefactors are seeking to use the COVID-19 pandemic to launch new cyber-
attacks. The COVID-19 pandemic has also led to increased disruption and volatility in capital markets
and credit markets. The pandemic and resulting economic uncertainty could adversely affect our
liquidity and capital resources in the future. The inputs into certain of our judgments, assumptions,
and estimates considered the economic implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on our critical and
significant accounting estimates. The actual results that we experience may differ materially from
our estimates. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to develop, many of our estimates could require
increased judgment and carry a higher degree of variability and volatility. As events continue to
evolve our estimates may change materially in future periods.
We are continuing to monitor the pandemic and take appropriate actions in accordance with the
recommendations and requirements of relevant authorities. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic on our operational and financial performance is currently uncertain and will depend on many
factors outside our control, including, without limitation, the timing, extent, trajectory and
duration of the pandemic, the development and availability of effective treatments and vaccines, the
imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global
economy. Potential negative impacts of these external factors include, but are not limited to,
material adverse effects on demand for our products and services; our supply chain and sales and
distribution channels; collectability of customer accounts; our ability to execute strategic plans;
impairments; and our profitability and cost structure. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely
affects our business, results of operations and financial condition, it may also have the effect of
exacerbating the other risks discussed in this “Risk Factors” section.
Our operating results may fluctuate in future periods, which may adversely affect our stock price.
Our operating results have been in the past, and will continue to be, subject to quarterly and annual
fluctuations as a result of numerous factors, some of which may contribute to more pronounced
fluctuations in an uncertain global economic environment. These factors include:
• Fluctuations in demand for our products and services, especially with respect to service providers
and Internet businesses, in part due to changes in the global economic environment
• Changes in sales and implementation cycles for our products and reduced visibility into our
customers’ spending plans and associated revenue
• Our ability to maintain appropriate inventory levels and purchase commitments
• Price and product competition in the communications and networking industries, which can change
rapidly due to technological innovation and different business models from various geographic regions
• The overall movement toward industry consolidation among both our competitors and our customers
• The introduction and market acceptance of new technologies and products, and our success in new and
evolving markets, and in emerging technologies, as well as the adoption of new standards
• The transformation of our business to deliver more software and subscription offerings where
revenue is recognized over time
• Variations in sales channels, product costs, mix of products sold, or mix of direct sales and
indirect sales
• The timing, size, and mix of orders from customers
• Manufacturing and customer lead times
• Fluctuations in our gross margins, and the factors that contribute to such fluctuations
• The ability of our customers, channel partners, contract manufacturers and suppliers to obtain
financing or to fund capital expenditures, especially during a period of global credit market
disruption or in the event of customer, channel partner, contract manufacturer or supplier financial
problems
• Actual events, circumstances, outcomes, and amounts differing from judgments, assumptions, and
estimates used in determining the values of certain assets (including the amounts of related
valuation allowances), liabilities, and other items reflected in our Consolidated Financial
Statements
• How well we execute on our strategy and operating plans and the impact of changes in our business
model that could result in significant restructuring charges
• Our ability to achieve targeted cost reductions
• Benefits anticipated from our investments
• Changes in tax laws or accounting rules, or interpretations thereof

As a consequence, operating results for a particular future period are difficult to predict, and,
therefore, prior results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods.
Any of the foregoing factors, or any other factors discussed elsewhere herein, could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition that could adversely
affect our stock price.
Our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions and the
uncertain geopolitical environment.
Challenging economic conditions worldwide have from time to time contributed, and may continue to
contribute, to slowdowns in the communications and networking industries at large, as well as in
specific segments and markets in which we operate, resulting in: reduced demand for our products as a
result of continued constraints on IT-related capital spending by our customers, particularly service
providers, and other customer markets as well; increased price competition for our products, not only
from our competitors but also as a consequence of customers disposing of unutilized products; risk of
excess and obsolete inventories; risk of supply constraints; risk of excess facilities and
manufacturing capacity; and higher overhead costs as a percentage of revenue and higher interest
expense.
The global macroeconomic environment continues to be challenging and inconsistent, and is being
significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. During fiscal 2020 and the first quarter of fiscal
2021, we continued to see a broad-based weakening in the global macroeconomic environment which
impacted our commercial and enterprise markets. We also experienced continuing weakness in emerging
countries, and we expect ongoing uncertainty in this market. Additionally, instability in the global
credit markets, the impact of uncertainty regarding global central bank monetary policy, the
instability in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the world including as a result of the
United Kingdom “Brexit” withdrawal from the European Union, the current economic challenges in China,
including global economic ramifications of Chinese economic difficulties, and other disruptions may
continue to put pressure on global economic conditions. If global economic and market conditions, or
economic conditions in key markets, remain uncertain or deteriorate further, we may experience
material impacts on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
Our operating results in one or more segments may also be affected by uncertain or changing economic
conditions particularly germane to that segment or to particular customer markets within that
segment. In addition, reports of certain intelligence gathering methods of the U.S. government could
affect customers’ perception of the products of IT companies which design and manufacture products in
the United States. Trust and confidence in us as an IT supplier are critical to the development and
growth of our markets. Impairment of that trust, or foreign regulatory actions taken in response to
reports of certain intelligence gathering methods of the U.S. government, could affect the demand for
our products from customers outside of the United States and could have an adverse effect on our
operating results.
Our revenue for a particular period is difficult to predict, and a shortfall in revenue may harm our
operating results.
As a result of a variety of factors discussed in this report, our revenue for a particular quarter is
difficult to predict, especially in light of a challenging and inconsistent global macroeconomic
environment, the significant impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, and related market uncertainty. Our
revenue may grow at a slower rate than in past periods or decline as it did in the first quarter of
fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, and in certain prior periods on a year-over-year basis. Our ability to
meet financial expectations could also be adversely affected if the nonlinear sales pattern seen in
some of our past quarters recurs in future periods. We have experienced periods of time during which
shipments have exceeded net bookings or manufacturing issues have delayed shipments, leading to
nonlinearity in shipping patterns. In addition to making it difficult to predict revenue for a
particular period, nonlinearity in shipping can increase costs, because irregular shipment patterns
result in periods of underutilized capacity and periods in which overtime expenses may be incurred,
as well as in potential additional inventory management-related costs. In addition, to the extent
that manufacturing issues and any related component shortages result in delayed shipments in the
future, and particularly in periods in which our contract manufacturers are operating at higher
levels of capacity, it is possible that revenue for a quarter could be adversely affected if such
matters occur and are not remediated within the same quarter.
The timing of large orders can also have a significant effect on our business and operating results
from quarter to quarter. From time to time, we receive large orders that have a significant effect on
our operating results in the period in which the order is recognized as revenue. The timing of such
orders is difficult to predict, and the timing of revenue recognition from such orders may affect
period to period changes in revenue. As a result, our operating results could vary materially from
quarter to quarter based on the receipt of such orders and their ultimate recognition as revenue.
Longer than normal manufacturing lead times in the past have caused, and in the future could cause,
some customers to place the same or a similar order multiple times within our various sales channels
and to cancel the duplicative orders upon shipment or receipt of the product, or to also place orders
with other vendors with shorter manufacturing lead times. Such multiple ordering (along with other
factors) or risk of order cancellation may cause difficulty in predicting our revenue. Further, our
efforts to improve manufacturing lead-time performance may result in more variability and less
predictability in our revenue and operating results. In addition, when facing
 15 
Table of Contents
component supply-related challenges we have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to
meet customer expectations, which in turn contribute to an increase in inventory and purchase
commitments. For example, in fiscal 2021, we increased our inventory and purchase commitments in
light of the supply chain challenges seen industrywide due to component shortages, caused in part by
the COVID-19 pandemic. These increases in our inventory and purchase commitments to shorten lead
times could also lead to significant excess and obsolete inventory charges if the demand for our
products is less than our expectations. We plan our operating expense levels based primarily on
forecasted revenue levels. These expenses and the impact of long-term commitments are relatively
fixed in the short term. A shortfall in revenue could lead to operating results being below
expectations because we may not be able to quickly reduce these fixed expenses in response to short-
term business changes. Any of the above factors could have a material adverse impact on our
operations and financial results.
Supply chain issues, including financial problems of contract manufacturers or component suppliers,
or a shortage of adequate component supply or manufacturing capacity that increase our costs or cause
a delay in our ability to fulfill orders, could have an adverse impact on our business and operating
results, and our failure to estimate customer demand properly may result in excess or obsolete
component supply, which could adversely affect our gross margins.
The fact that we do not own or operate the bulk of our manufacturing facilities and that we are
reliant on our extended supply chain could have an adverse impact on the supply of our products and
on our business and operating results. Financial problems of either contract manufacturers or
component suppliers, reservation of manufacturing capacity at our contract manufacturers by other
companies, and industry consolidation occurring within one or more component supplier markets, such
as the semiconductor market, in each case, could either limit supply or increase costs.
A reduction or interruption in supply, including disruptions on our global supply chain as a result
of the COVID-19 pandemic or a significant natural disaster (including as a result of climate change);
a significant increase in the price of one or more components; a failure to adequately authorize
procurement of inventory by our contract manufacturers; a failure to appropriately cancel,
reschedule, or adjust our requirements based on our business needs; or a decrease in demand for our
products could materially adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition
and could materially damage customer relationships. Furthermore, as a result of binding price or
purchase commitments with suppliers, we may be obligated to purchase components at prices that are
higher than those available in the current market. In the event that we become committed to purchase
components at prices in excess of the current market price when the components are actually used, our
gross margins could decrease. In addition, vendors may be under pressure to allocate product to
certain customers for business, regulatory or political reasons, and/or demand changes in agreed
pricing as a condition of supply. Although we have generally secured additional supply or taken other
mitigation actions when significant disruptions have occurred, if similar situations occur in the
future, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and
financial condition.
Our growth and ability to meet customer demands depend in part on our ability to obtain timely
deliveries of parts from our suppliers and contract manufacturers. We have experienced component
shortages in the past, including shortages caused by manufacturing process issues, that have affected
our operations, including longer than normal lead times. There is currently a market shortage of
semiconductor and other component supply which has affected, and could further affect, lead times,
the cost of that supply, and our ability to meet customer demand for our products if we cannot secure
sufficient supply in a timely manner. We expect these supply chain challenges and cost impacts to
continue through at least the first half of fiscal 2022 and potentially into the second half of
fiscal 2022. Additionally, we may in the future experience a shortage of certain component parts as a
result of our own manufacturing issues, manufacturing issues at our suppliers or contract
manufacturers, capacity problems experienced by our suppliers or contract manufacturers including
capacity or cost problems resulting from industry consolidation, or strong demand for those parts.
Growth in the economy is likely to create greater pressures on us and our suppliers to accurately
project overall component demand and component demands within specific product categories and to
establish optimal component levels and manufacturing capacity, especially for labor-intensive
components, components for which we purchase a substantial portion of the supply, or the re-ramping
of manufacturing capacity for highly complex products. During periods of shortages or delays the
price of components may increase, or the components may not be available at all, and we may also
encounter shortages if we do not accurately anticipate our needs. We may not be able to secure enough
components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build new products in a timely manner in
the quantities or configurations needed. Accordingly, our revenue and gross margins could suffer
until other sources can be developed.
Our operating results would also be adversely affected if, anticipating greater demand than actually
develops, we commit to the purchase of more components than we need, which is more likely to occur in
a period of demand uncertainties such as we are currently experiencing. There can be no assurance
that we will not encounter these problems in the future. Although in many cases we use standard parts
and components for our products, certain components are presently available only from a single source
or limited sources, and a global economic downturn and related market uncertainty could negatively
impact the availability of components from one or more of these sources, especially during times such
as we have recently seen when there are supplier constraints based on labor and other actions taken
during economic downturns. We may not be able to diversify
 16

sources in a timely manner, which could harm our ability to deliver products to customers and
seriously impact present and future sales.
We believe that we may be faced with the following challenges in the future: new markets in which we
participate may grow quickly, which may make it difficult to quickly obtain significant component
capacity; as we acquire companies and new technologies, we may be dependent on unfamiliar supply
chains or relatively small supply partners; and we face competition for certain components that are
supply-constrained, from existing competitors, and companies in other markets.
Manufacturing capacity and component supply constraints could continue to be significant issues for
us. We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to
provide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of business, in order to
improve manufacturing lead-time performance and to help ensure adequate component supply, we enter
into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that either allow them to procure inventory
based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements. In
certain instances, these agreements allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our
requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed. When facing component
supply-related challenges we have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to meet
customer expectations, which in turn contributes to an increase in inventory and purchase
commitments. For example, in fiscal 2021, we increased our inventory and purchase commitments in
light of the supply chain challenges seen industrywide due to component shortages, caused in part by
the COVID-19 pandemic. These increases in our inventory and purchase commitments to shorten lead
times could also lead to significant excess and obsolete inventory charges if the demand for our
products is less than our expectations. If we fail to anticipate customer demand properly, an
oversupply of parts could result in excess or obsolete components that could adversely affect our
gross margins. For additional information regarding our purchase commitments with contract
manufacturers and suppliers, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
We expect gross margin to vary over time, and our level of product gross margin may not be
sustainable.
Our level of product gross margins declined in fiscal 2021 and have declined in certain prior periods
on a year-over-year basis, and could decline in future periods due to adverse impacts from various
factors, including:
• Changes in customer, geographic, or product mix, including mix of configurations within each
product group
• Introduction of new products, including products with price-performance advantages, and new
business models including the transformation of our business to deliver more software and
subscription offerings
• Our ability to reduce production costs
• Entry into new markets or growth in lower margin markets, including markets with different pricing
and cost structures, through acquisitions or internal development
• Sales discounts
• Increases in material, labor or other manufacturing-related costs (i.e. component costs, broker
fees, expedited freight and overtime) or higher supply chain logistics costs, any of which could be
significant, especially during periods of supply constraints for certain costs, such as those
impacting the market for components, including semiconductors and memory
• Excess inventory, inventory holding charges, and obsolescence charges
• Changes in shipment volume
• The timing of revenue recognition and revenue deferrals
• Increased cost (including those caused by tariffs), loss of cost savings or dilution of savings due
to changes in component pricing or charges incurred due to inventory holding periods if parts
ordering does not correctly anticipate product demand or if the financial health of either contract
manufacturers or suppliers deteriorates
• Lower than expected benefits from value engineering
• Increased price competition, including competitors from Asia, especially from China
• Changes in distribution channels
• Increased warranty or royalty costs
• Increased amortization of purchased intangible assets, especially from acquisitions
• How well we execute on our strategy and operating plans
Changes in service gross margin may result from various factors such as changes in the mix between
technical support services and advanced services, as well as the timing of technical support service
contract initiations and renewals and the addition of personnel and other resources to support higher
levels of service business in future periods.

Sales to the service provider market are especially volatile, and weakness in orders from this
industry may harm our operating results and financial condition.
Sales to the service provider market have been characterized by large and sporadic purchases,
especially relating to our router sales and sales of certain other Infrastructure Platforms and
Applications products, in addition to longer sales cycles. Service provider product orders decreased
during the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and in certain prior periods, and at various times in the
past, including in recent quarters, we have experienced significant weakness in product orders from
service providers. Product orders from the service provider market could continue to decline and, as
has been the case in the past, such weakness could persist over extended periods of time given
fluctuating market conditions. Sales activity in this industry depends upon the stage of completion
of expanding network infrastructures; the availability of funding; and the extent to which service
providers are affected by regulatory, economic, and business conditions in the country of operations.
Weakness in orders from this industry, including as a result of any slowdown in capital expenditures
by service providers (which may be more prevalent during a global economic downturn, or periods of
economic, political or regulatory uncertainty), could have a material adverse effect on our business,
operating results, and financial condition. Such slowdowns may continue or recur in future periods.
Orders from this industry could decline for many reasons other than the competitiveness of our
products and services within their respective markets. For example, in the past, many of our service
provider customers have been materially and adversely affected by slowdowns in the general economy,
by overcapacity, by changes in the service provider market, by regulatory developments, and by
constraints on capital availability, resulting in business failures and substantial reductions in
spending and expansion plans. These conditions have materially harmed our business and operating
results in the past, and could affect our business and operating results in any future period.
Finally, service provider customers typically have longer implementation cycles; require a broader
range of services, including design services; demand that vendors take on a larger share of risks;
often require acceptance provisions, which can lead to a delay in revenue recognition; and expect
financing from vendors. All these factors can add further risk to business conducted with service
providers.
Disruption of or changes in our distribution model could harm our sales and margins.
If we fail to manage distribution of our products and services properly, or if our distributors’
financial condition or operations weaken, our revenue and gross margins could be adversely affected.
A substantial portion of our products and services is sold through our channel partners, and the
remainder is sold through direct sales. Our channel partners include systems integrators, service
providers, other resellers, and distributors. Systems integrators and service providers typically
sell directly to end users and often provide system installation, technical support, professional
services, and other support services in addition to network equipment sales. Systems integrators also
typically integrate our products into an overall solution, and a number of service providers are also
systems integrators. Distributors stock inventory and typically sell to systems integrators, service
providers, and other resellers. We refer to sales through distributors as our two-tier system of
sales to the end customer. If sales through indirect channels increase, this may lead to greater
difficulty in forecasting the mix of our products and, to a degree, the timing of orders from our
customers.
Historically, we have seen fluctuations in our gross margins based on changes in the balance of our
distribution channels. There can be no assurance that changes in the balance of our distribution
model in future periods would not have an adverse effect on our gross margins and profitability. Some
factors could result in disruption of or changes in our distribution model, which could harm our
sales and margins, including the following: competition with some of our channel partners, including
through our direct sales, which may lead these channel partners to use other suppliers that do not
directly sell their own products or otherwise compete with them; some of our channel partners may
demand that we absorb a greater share of the risks that their customers may ask them to bear; some of
our channel partners may have insufficient financial resources and may not be able to withstand
changes and challenges in business conditions; and revenue from indirect sales could suffer if our
distributors’ financial condition or operations weaken. In addition, we depend on our channel
partners globally to comply with applicable regulatory requirements. To the extent that they fail to
do so, that could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial
condition. Further, sales of our products outside of agreed territories can result in disruption to
our distribution channels.
The markets in which we compete are intensely competitive, which could adversely affect our
achievement of revenue growth.
The markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid change, converging technologies, and a
migration to networking and communications solutions that offer relative advantages. These market
factors represent a competitive threat to us. We compete with numerous vendors in each product
category. The overall number of our competitors providing niche product solutions may increase. Also,
the identity and composition of competitors may change as we increase our activity in newer product
areas, and in key priority and growth areas. For example, as products related to network
programmability, such as software defined networking (SDN) products, become more prevalent, we expect
to face increased competition from companies that develop networking products based on commoditized
hardware, referred to as “white box” hardware, to the extent customers decide to purchase those
product offerings instead of ours. In addition, the growth in demand for technology
 18 
Table of Contents
delivered as a service enables new competitors to enter the market. As we continue to expand
globally, we may see new competition in different geographic regions. In particular, we have
experienced price-focused competition from competitors in Asia, especially from China, and we
anticipate this will continue. For information regarding our competitors, see the section entitled
“Competition” contained in Item 1. Business of this report.
Some of our competitors compete across many of our product lines, while others are primarily focused
in a specific product area. Barriers to entry are relatively low, and new ventures to create products
that do or could compete with our products are regularly formed. In addition, some of our competitors
may have greater resources, including technical and engineering resources, than we do. As we expand
into new markets, we will face competition not only from our existing competitors but also from other
competitors, including existing companies with strong technological, marketing, and sales positions
in those markets. We also sometimes face competition from resellers and distributors of our products.
Companies with which we have strategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas, and
this trend may increase. For example, the enterprise data center is undergoing a fundamental
transformation arising from the convergence of technologies, including computing, networking,
storage, and software, that previously were segregated. Due to several factors, including the
availability of highly scalable and general purpose microprocessors, ASICs offering advanced
services, standards based protocols, cloud computing and virtualization, the convergence of
technologies within the enterprise data center is spanning multiple, previously independent,
technology segments. Also, some of our current and potential competitors for enterprise data center
business have made acquisitions, or announced new strategic alliances, designed to position them to
provide end-to-end technology solutions for the enterprise data center. As a result of all of these
developments, we face greater competition in the development and sale of enterprise data center
technologies, including competition from entities that are among our long-term strategic alliance
partners. Companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or
form alliances with our competitors, thereby reducing their business with us.
The principal competitive factors in the markets in which we presently compete and may compete in the
future include the ability to sell successful business outcomes; the ability to provide a broad range
of networking and communications products and services; product performance; price; the ability to
introduce new products, including providing continuous new customer value and products with price-
performance advantages; the ability to reduce production costs; the ability to provide value-added
features such as security, reliability, and investment protection; conformance to standards; market
presence; the ability to provide financing; and disruptive technology shifts and new business models.
We also face competition from customers to which we license or supply technology and suppliers from
which we transfer technology. The inherent nature of networking requires interoperability. As such,
we must cooperate and at the same time compete with many companies. Any inability to effectively
manage these complicated relationships with customers, suppliers, and strategic alliance partners
could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition and
accordingly affect our chances of success.
If we do not successfully manage our strategic alliances, we may not realize the expected benefits
from such alliances, and we may experience increased competition or delays in product development.
We have several strategic alliances with large and complex organizations and other companies with
which we work to offer complementary products and services and, in the past, have established a joint
venture to market services associated with our Cisco Unified Computing System products. These
arrangements are generally limited to specific projects, the goal of which is generally to facilitate
product compatibility and adoption of industry standards. There can be no assurance we will realize
the expected benefits from these strategic alliances or from the joint venture. If successful, these
relationships may be mutually beneficial and result in industry growth. However, alliances carry an
element of risk because, in most cases, we must compete in some business areas with a company with
which we have a strategic alliance and, at the same time, cooperate with that company in other
business areas. Also, if these companies fail to perform or if these relationships fail to
materialize as expected, we could suffer delays in product development or other operational
difficulties. Joint ventures can be difficult to manage, given the potentially different interests of
joint venture partners.
Inventory management relating to our sales to our two-tier distribution channel is complex, and
excess inventory may harm our gross margins.
We must manage inventory relating to sales to our distributors effectively, because inventory held by
them could affect our results of operations. Our distributors may increase orders during periods of
product shortages, cancel orders if their inventory is too high, or delay orders in anticipation of
new products. They also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the
products of our competitors that are available to them, and in response to seasonal fluctuations in
end-user demand. Our distributors are generally given business terms that allow them to return a
portion of inventory, receive credits for changes in selling price, and participate in various
cooperative marketing programs. Inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need
to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory
obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements. When facing component
supply-related
 19 
Table of Contents
challenges, we have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to meet customer
expectations. If we ultimately determine that we have excess inventory, we may have to reduce our
prices and write down inventory, which in turn could result in lower gross margins.
We depend upon the development of new products and services, and enhancements to existing products
and services, and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers’
changing needs, our operating results and market share may suffer.
The markets for our products and services are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving
industry standards, new product and service introductions, and evolving methods of building and
operating networks. Our operating results depend on our ability to develop and introduce new products
and services into existing and emerging markets and to reduce the production costs of existing
products. If customers do not purchase and/or renew our offerings our business could be harmed. The
COVID-19 pandemic may also result in long-term changes in customer needs for our products and
services in various sectors, along with IT-related capital spending reductions, or shifts in spending
focus, that could materially adversely affect us if we are unable to adjust our product and service
offerings to match customer needs.
The process of developing new technology, including more programmable, flexible and virtual networks,
and technology related to other market transitions— such as security, digital transformation and IoT,
and cloud— is complex and uncertain, and if we fail to accurately predict customers’ changing needs
and emerging technological trends our business could be harmed. We must commit significant resources,
including the investments we have been making in our strategic priorities to developing new products
and services before knowing whether our investments will result in products and services the market
will accept. In particular, if our model of the evolution of networking does not emerge as we believe
it will, or if the industry does not evolve as we believe it will, or if our strategy for addressing
this evolution is not successful, many of our strategic initiatives and investments may be of no or
limited value. For example, if we do not introduce products related to network programmability, such
as software-defined-networking products, in a timely fashion, or if product offerings in this market
that ultimately succeed are based on technology, or an approach to technology, that differs from
ours, such as, for example, networking products based on “white box” hardware, our business could be
harmed. Similarly, our business could be harmed if we fail to develop, or fail to develop in a timely
fashion, offerings to address other transitions, or if the offerings addressing these other
transitions that ultimately succeed are based on technology, or an approach to technology, different
from ours. In addition, our business could be adversely affected in periods surrounding our new
product introductions if customers delay purchasing decisions to qualify or otherwise evaluate the
new product offerings. We have also been transforming our business to move from selling individual
products and services to selling products and services integrated into architectures and solutions,
and we are seeking to meet the evolving needs of customers which include offering our products and
solutions in the manner in which customers wish to consume them. As a part of this transformation, we
continue to make changes to how we are organized and how we build and deliver our technology,
including changes in our business models with customers. If our strategy for addressing our customer
needs, or the architectures and solutions we develop do not meet those needs, or the changes we are
making in how we are organized and how we build and deliver or technology is incorrect or
ineffective, our business could be harmed.
Furthermore, we may not execute successfully on our vision or strategy because of challenges with
regard to product planning and timing, technical hurdles that we fail to overcome in a timely
fashion, or a lack of appropriate resources. This could result in competitors, some of which may also
be our strategic alliance partners, providing those solutions before we do and loss of market share,
revenue, and earnings. In addition, the growth in demand for technology delivered as a service
enables new competitors to enter the market. The success of new products and services depends on
several factors, including proper new product and service definition, component costs, timely
completion and introduction of these products and services, differentiation of new products and
services from those of our competitors, and market acceptance of these products and services. There
can be no assurance that we will successfully identify new product and services opportunities,
develop and bring new products and services to market in a timely manner, or achieve market
acceptance of our products and services or that products, services and technologies developed by
others will not render our products, services or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive. The
products and technologies in our other product categories and key priority and growth areas may not
prove to have the market success we anticipate, and we may not successfully identify and invest in
other emerging or new products and services.
Changes in industry structure and market conditions could lead to charges related to discontinuances
of certain of our products or businesses, asset impairments and workforce reductions or
restructurings.
In response to changes in industry and market conditions, we may be required to strategically realign
our resources and to consider restructuring, disposing of, or otherwise exiting businesses. Any
resource realignment, or decision to limit investment in or dispose of or otherwise exit businesses,
may result in the recording of special charges, such as inventory and technology-related write-offs,
workforce reduction or restructuring costs, charges relating to consolidation of excess facilities,
or claims from third parties who were resellers or users of discontinued products. Our estimates with
respect to the useful life or ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis of assets, including
purchased intangible assets, could change as a result of such
 20 
Table of Contents
assessments and decisions. Although in certain instances our supply agreements allow us the option to
cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders
being placed, our loss contingencies may include liabilities for contracts that we cannot cancel with
contract manufacturers and suppliers. Further, our estimates relating to the liabilities for excess
facilities are affected by changes in real estate market conditions. Additionally, we are required to
perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain
circumstances, and future goodwill impairment tests may result in a charge to earnings. We initiated
a restructuring plan in the first quarter of fiscal 2021, which included a voluntary early retirement
program, and which has now been substantially completed. Our business may not be more efficient or
effective than prior to implementation of the plan. Our restructuring activities, including any
related charges and the impact of the related headcount restructurings, could have a material adverse
effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
Over the long term we intend to invest in engineering, sales, service and marketing activities, and
in key priority and growth areas, and these investments may achieve delayed, or lower than expected,
benefits which could harm our operating results.
While we intend to focus on managing our costs and expenses, over the long term, we also intend to
invest in personnel and other resources related to our engineering, sales, service and marketing
functions as we realign and dedicate resources on key priority and growth areas, such as Security and
Applications, and we also intend to focus on maintaining leadership in Infrastructure Platforms and
in Services. We are likely to recognize the costs associated with these investments earlier than some
of the anticipated benefits, and the return on these investments may be lower, or may develop more
slowly, than we expect. If we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments
(including if our selection of areas for investment does not play out as we expect), or if the
achievement of these benefits is delayed, our operating results may be adversely affected.
We have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions that could disrupt our operations and harm
our operating results.
Our growth depends upon market growth, our ability to enhance our existing products, and our ability
to introduce new products on a timely basis. We intend to continue to address the need to develop new
products and enhance existing products through acquisitions of other companies, product lines,
technologies, and personnel. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following:
• Difficulties in integrating the operations, systems, technologies, products, and personnel of the
acquired companies, particularly companies with large and widespread operations and/or complex
products
• Diversion of management’s attention from normal daily operations of the business and the challenges
of managing larger and more widespread operations resulting from acquisitions
• Potential difficulties in completing projects associated with in-process research and development
intangibles
• Difficulties in entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where
competitors in such markets have stronger market positions
• Initial dependence on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners
• Insufficient revenue to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions
• The potential loss of key employees, customers, distributors, vendors and other business partners
of the companies we acquire following and continuing after announcement of acquisition plans
Acquisitions may also cause us to:
• Issue common stock that would dilute our current stockholders’ percentage ownership
• Use a substantial portion of our cash resources, or incur debt
• Significantly increase our interest expense, leverage and debt service requirements if we incur
additional debt to pay for an acquisition
• Assume liabilities
• Record goodwill and intangible assets that are subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and
potential periodic impairment charges
• Incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets
• Incur tax expenses related to the effect of acquisitions on our legal structure
• Incur large write-offs and restructuring and other related expenses
• Become subject to intellectual property or other litigation
 21 
Table of Contents
Mergers and acquisitions of high-technology companies are inherently risky and subject to many
factors outside of our control, and no assurance can be given that our previous or future
acquisitions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business, operating
results, or financial condition. Failure to manage and successfully integrate acquisitions could
materially harm our business and operating results. Prior acquisitions have resulted in a wide range
of outcomes, from successful introduction of new products and technologies to a failure to do so.
Even when an acquired company has already developed and marketed products, there can be no assurance
that product enhancements will be made in a timely fashion or that pre-acquisition due diligence will
have identified all possible issues that might arise with respect to such products. In addition, our
effective tax rate for future periods is uncertain and could be impacted by mergers and acquisitions.
Risks related to new product development also apply to acquisitions.
Entrance into new or developing markets exposes us to additional competition and will likely increase
demands on our service and support operations.
As we focus on new market opportunities and key priority and growth areas, we will increasingly
compete with large telecommunications equipment suppliers as well as startup companies. Several of
our competitors may have greater resources, including technical and engineering resources, than we
do. Additionally, as customers in these markets complete infrastructure deployments, they may require
greater levels of service, support, and financing than we have provided in the past, especially in
emerging countries. Demand for these types of service, support, or financing contracts may increase
in the future. There can be no assurance that we can provide products, service, support, and
financing to effectively compete for these market opportunities. Further, entry into other markets
has subjected and will subject us to additional risks, particularly to those markets, including the
effects of general market conditions and reduced consumer confidence. For example, as we add direct
selling capabilities globally to meet changing customer demands, we will face increased legal and
regulatory requirements.
Industry consolidation may lead to increased competition and may harm our operating results.
There is a continuing trend toward industry consolidation in our markets. We expect this trend to
continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry
and as companies are acquired or are unable to continue operations. For example, some of our current
and potential competitors for enterprise data center business have made acquisitions, or announced
new strategic alliances, designed to position them with the ability to provide end-to-end technology
solutions for the enterprise data center. Companies that are strategic alliance partners in some
areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors, thereby reducing their
business with us. We believe that industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are
better able to compete as sole-source vendors for customers. This could lead to more variability in
our operating results and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results,
and financial condition. Furthermore, particularly in the service provider market, rapid
consolidation will lead to fewer customers, with the effect that loss of a major customer could have
a material impact on results not anticipated in a customer marketplace composed of more numerous
participants.
Product quality problems could lead to reduced revenue, gross margins, and net income.
We produce highly complex products that incorporate leading-edge technology, including both hardware
and software. Software typically contains bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with expected
operations. There can be no assurance that our pre-shipment testing programs will be adequate to
detect all defects, either ones in individual products or ones that could affect numerous shipments,
which might interfere with customer satisfaction, reduce sales opportunities, or affect gross
margins. From time to time, we have had to replace certain components and provide remediation in
response to the discovery of defects or bugs in products that we had shipped. There can be no
assurance that such remediation, depending on the product involved, would not have a material impact.
An inability to cure a product defect could result in the failure of a product line, temporary or
permanent withdrawal from a product or market, damage to our reputation, inventory costs, or product
reengineering expenses, any of which could have a material impact on our revenue, margins, and net
income.
Due to the global nature of our operations, political or economic changes or other factors in a
specific country or region could harm our operating results and financial condition.
We conduct significant sales and customer support operations in countries around the world. As such,
our growth depends in part on our increasing sales into emerging countries. We also depend on
non-U.S. operations of our contract manufacturers, component suppliers and distribution partners. Our
business in emerging countries in the aggregate experienced a decline in orders in the first half of
fiscal 2021 and in certain prior periods. We continue to assess the sustainability of any
improvements in our business in these countries and there can be no assurance that our investments in
these countries will be successful. Our future results could be materially adversely affected by a
variety of political, economic or other factors relating to our operations inside and outside the
United States, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and
financial condition, including the following: impacts from global central bank monetary policy;
issues related to the political relationship between the United States and other countries that can
affect regulatory matters, affect the willingness of customers in those countries to purchase
products from companies headquartered in the United States or affect our ability to
 22 
Table of Contents
procure components if a government body were to deny us access to those components; government-
related disruptions or shutdowns; the challenging and inconsistent global macroeconomic environment;
foreign currency exchange rates; political or social unrest; economic instability or weakness or
natural disasters in a specific country or region, including economic challenges in China and global
economic ramifications of Chinese economic difficulties; instability as a result of Brexit;
environmental protection regulations (including new laws and regulations related to climate change),
trade protection measures such as tariffs, and other legal and regulatory requirements, some of which
may affect our ability to import our products to, export our products from, or sell our products in
various countries or affect our ability to procure components; political considerations that affect
service provider and government spending patterns; health or similar issues, including pandemics or
epidemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic which could continue to affect customer purchasing decisions;
difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; and adverse tax consequences,
including imposition of withholding or other taxes on our global operations.
We are exposed to the credit risk of some of our customers and to credit exposures in weakened
markets, which could result in material losses.
Most of our sales are on an open credit basis, with typical payment terms of 30 days in the United
States and, because of local customs or conditions, longer in some markets outside the United States.
Beyond our open credit arrangements, we have also experienced demands for customer financing and
facilitation of leasing arrangements. Our loan financing arrangements may include not only financing
the acquisition of our products and services but also providing additional funds for other costs
associated with network installation and integration of our products and services. Our exposure to
the credit risks relating to our financing activities may increase if our customers are adversely
affected by a global economic downturn or periods of economic uncertainty. There can be no assurance
that programs we have in place to monitor and mitigate credit risks will be effective. In the past,
there have been significant bankruptcies among customers both on open credit and with loan or lease
financing arrangements, particularly among Internet businesses and service providers, causing us to
incur economic or financial losses. There can be no assurance that additional losses will not be
incurred. Although these losses have not been material to date, future losses, if incurred, could
harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial
condition. Additionally, to the degree that turmoil in the credit markets makes it more difficult for
some customers to obtain financing, those customers’ ability to pay could be adversely impacted,
which in turn could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial
condition.
We are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest
rates; impairment of our investments could harm our earnings.
We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. Our portfolio
includes available-for-sale debt investments and equity investments, the values of which are subject
to market price volatility. If such investments suffer market price declines, as we experienced with
some of our investments in the past, we may recognize in earnings the decline in the fair value of
our investments below their cost basis. Our privately held investments are subject to risk of loss of
investment capital. These investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies
or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize.
We could lose our entire investment in these companies. For information regarding the market risks
associated with the fair value of portfolio investments and interest rates, refer to the section
titled “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”
We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial
results and cash flows.
Because a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the United States, we face
exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates, including emerging market
currencies which can have extreme currency volatility. An increase in the value of the dollar could
increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the United States
where we sell in dollars and a weakened dollar could increase the cost of local operating expenses
and procurement of raw materials to the extent that we must purchase components in foreign
currencies. These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve, and they could have a
material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows.
Failure to retain and recruit key personnel would harm our ability to meet key objectives.
Our success has always depended in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled
technical, managerial, sales, and marketing personnel. Competition for these personnel is intense,
especially in the Silicon Valley area of Northern California. Stock incentive plans are designed to
reward employees for their long-term contributions and provide incentives for them to remain with us.
Volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price or equity incentive awards, or changes
to our overall compensation program, including our stock incentive program, resulting from the
management of share dilution and share-based compensation expense or otherwise, may also adversely
affect our ability to retain key employees. As a result of one or more of these factors, we may
increase our hiring in geographic areas outside the United States, which could subject us to
additional geopolitical and exchange rate risk. The loss of services of any of our key personnel; the
inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future; or delays in hiring required
personnel, particularly engineering and sales personnel,
 23

could make it difficult to meet key objectives, such as timely and effective product introductions.
In addition, companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently
claim that competitors have engaged in improper hiring practices. We have received these claims in
the past and may receive additional claims to this effect in the future.
Adverse resolution of litigation or governmental investigations may harm our operating results or
financial condition.
We are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business. Litigation can be expensive,
lengthy, and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results of complex legal
proceedings are difficult to predict. An unfavorable resolution of lawsuits or governmental
investigations could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial
condition. For additional information regarding certain of the matters in which we are involved, see
Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, subsection (f) “Legal Proceedings.”
Our operating results may be adversely affected and damage to our reputation may occur due to
production and sale of counterfeit versions of our products.
As is the case with leading products around the world, our products are subject to efforts by third
parties to produce counterfeit versions of our products. While we work diligently with law
enforcement authorities in various countries to block the manufacture of counterfeit goods and to
interdict their sale, and to detect counterfeit products in customer networks, and have succeeded in
prosecuting counterfeiters and their distributors, resulting in fines, imprisonment and restitution
to us, there can be no guarantee that such efforts will succeed. While counterfeiters often aim their
sales at customers who might not have otherwise purchased our products due to lack of verifiability
of origin and service, such counterfeit sales, to the extent they replace otherwise legitimate sales,
could adversely affect our operating results.
Changes in our provision for income taxes or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our
income tax returns could adversely affect our results.
Our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by earnings
being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in
countries that have higher tax rates; by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and
liabilities; by changes to foreign-derived intangible income, global intangible low-tax income and
base erosion and anti-abuse tax laws, regulations, or interpretations thereof; by expiration of or
lapses in tax incentives; by transfer pricing adjustments, including the effect of acquisitions on
our legal structure; by tax effects of nondeductible compensation; by tax costs related to
intercompany realignments; by changes in accounting principles; or by changes in tax laws and
regulations, treaties, or interpretations thereof, including changes to the taxation of earnings of
our foreign subsidiaries, the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income, and the
foreign tax credit rules. Significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and
measurement attribute prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes. The
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), an international association comprised
of 38 countries, including the United States, has made changes and is contemplating additional
changes to numerous long-standing tax principles. There can be no assurance that these changes and
any contemplated changes if finalized, once adopted by countries, will not have an adverse impact on
our provision for income taxes. Further, as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital
investment actions and commitments, our income in certain countries was subject to reduced tax rates.
Our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes. In
addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal
Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes
resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There
can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse
effect on our operating results and financial condition.
Our business and operations are especially subject to the risks of earthquakes, floods, and other
natural catastrophic events (including as a result of global climate change).
Our corporate headquarters, including certain of our research and development operations are located
in the Silicon Valley area of Northern California, a region known for seismic activity. Additionally,
a certain number of our facilities are located near rivers that have experienced flooding in the
past. Also certain of our suppliers and logistics centers are located in regions that have been or
may be affected by earthquake, tsunami and flooding activity which in the past has disrupted, and in
the future could disrupt, the flow of components and delivery of products. In addition, global
climate change may result in significant natural disasters occurring more frequently or with greater
intensity, such as drought, wildfires, storms, sea-level rise, and flooding. A significant natural
disaster, such as an earthquake, a hurricane, volcano, flood or a wildfire, could have a material
adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
Terrorism and other events may harm our business, operating results and financial condition.
The continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response to this
threat, or any future acts of terrorism, may cause further disruptions to the economies of the United
States and other countries and create further uncertainties or otherwise materially harm our
business, operating results, and financial condition. Likewise, events such as loss
 24 
Table of Contents
of infrastructure and utilities services such as energy, transportation, or telecommunications could
have similar negative impacts. To the extent that such disruptions or uncertainties result in delays
or cancellations of customer orders or the manufacture or shipment of our products, our business,
operating results, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.
There can be no assurance that our operating results and financial condition will not be adversely
affected by our incurrence of debt.
As of the end of fiscal 2021, we have senior unsecured notes outstanding in an aggregate principal
amount of $11.5 billion that mature at specific dates from calendar year 2021 through 2040. We have
also established a commercial paper program under which we may issue short-term, unsecured commercial
paper notes on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of
$10.0 billion, and we had no commercial paper notes outstanding under this program as of July 31,
2021 . There can be no assurance that our incurrence of this debt or any future debt will be a better
means of providing liquidity to us than would our use of our existing cash resources. Further, we
cannot be assured that our maintenance of this indebtedness or incurrence of future indebtedness will
not adversely affect our operating results or financial condition. In addition, changes by any rating
agency to our credit rating can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity
securities, as well as the terms upon which we may borrow under our commercial paper program or
future debt issuances.
 Risks Related to Intellectual Property 
Our proprietary rights may prove difficult to enforce.
We generally rely on patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secret laws to establish and maintain
proprietary rights in our technology and products. Although we have been issued numerous patents and
other patent applications are currently pending, there can be no assurance that any of these patents
or other proprietary rights will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented or that our rights
will, in fact, provide competitive advantages to us. Furthermore, many key aspects of networking
technology are governed by industrywide standards, which are usable by all market entrants. In
addition, there can be no assurance that patents will be issued from pending applications or that
claims allowed on any patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. In addition, the
laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the
laws of the United States. The outcome of any actions taken in these foreign countries may be
different than if such actions were determined under the laws of the United States. Although we are
not dependent on any individual patents or group of patents for particular segments of the business
for which we compete, if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights to the totality of the
features (including aspects of products protected other than by patent rights) in a market, we may
find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the substantial expense,
time, and effort required to create innovative products that have enabled us to be successful.
We may be found to infringe on intellectual property rights of others.
Third parties, including customers, have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate
litigation related to exclusive patent, copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property rights
to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us. These assertions have increased over
time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims assertions,
particularly in the United States. Because of the existence of a large number of patents in the
networking field, the secrecy of some pending patents, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents,
it is not economically practical or even possible to determine in advance whether a product or any of
its components infringes or will infringe on the patent rights of others. The asserted claims and/or
initiated litigation can include claims against us or our manufacturers, suppliers, or customers,
alleging infringement of their proprietary rights with respect to our existing or future products or
components of those products. Regardless of the merit of these claims, they can be time-consuming,
result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel, or require us to
develop a non-infringing technology or enter into license agreements. Where claims are made by
customers, resistance even to unmeritorious claims could damage customer relationships. There can be
no assurance that licenses will be available on acceptable terms and conditions, if at all, or that
our indemnification by our suppliers will be adequate to cover our costs if a claim were brought
directly against us or our customers. Furthermore, because of the potential for high court awards
that are not necessarily predictable, it is not unusual to find even arguably unmeritorious claims
settled for significant amounts. If any infringement or other intellectual property claim made
against us by any third party is successful, if we are required to indemnify a customer with respect
to a claim against the customer, or if we fail to develop non-infringing technology or license the
proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions, our business, operating results,
and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. For additional information
regarding our indemnification obligations, see Note 14(e) to the Consolidated Financial Statements
contained in this report. Our exposure to risks associated with the use of intellectual property may
be increased as a result of acquisitions, as we have a lower level of visibility into the development
process with respect to such technology or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks.
Further, in the
 25 
Table of Contents
past, third parties have made infringement and similar claims after we have acquired technology that
had not been asserted prior to our acquisition.
We rely on the availability of third-party licenses.
Many of our products are designed to include software or other intellectual property licensed from
third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various
aspects of these products. There can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available
on acceptable terms, if at all. The inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain
such licenses or rights on favorable terms, or the need to engage in litigation regarding these
matters, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial
condition. Moreover, the inclusion in our products of software or other intellectual property
licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis could limit our ability to protect our
proprietary rights in our products.
 Risks Related to Cybersecurity and Regulations 
Cyber-attacks, data breaches or malware may disrupt our operations, harm our operating results and
financial condition, and damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business; and cyber-
attacks or data breaches on our customers’ networks, or in cloud-based services provided by or
enabled by us, could result in claims of liability against us, damage our reputation or otherwise
materially harm our business.
We experience cyber-attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to our systems on a
regular basis, and we anticipate continuing to be subject to such attempts. Despite our
implementation of security measures, (i) our products and services, and (ii) the servers, data
centers, and cloud-based solutions on which our and third-party data is stored, are vulnerable to
cyber-attacks, data breaches, malware, and disruptions from unauthorized access, tampering or other
theft or misuse, including by employees, malicious actors or inadvertent error. Such events have and
could in the future compromise or disrupt access to or the operation of our products, services, and
networks or those of our customers, or result in the information stored on our systems or those of
our customers being improperly accessed, processed, disclosed, lost or stolen. We have not to date
experienced a material event; however, the occurrence of any such event in the future could subject
us to liability to our customers, suppliers, business partners and others, give rise to legal and/or
regulatory action, could damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business, and could
have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Efforts
to limit the ability of malicious actors to disrupt the operations of the Internet or undermine our
own security efforts may be costly to implement and may not be successful. Breaches of security in
our customers’ networks, or in cloud-based services provided by or enabled by us, regardless of
whether the breach is attributable to a vulnerability in our products or services, could result in
claims of liability against us, damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business.
Vulnerabilities and critical security defects, prioritization decisions regarding remedying
vulnerabilities or security defects, failure of third-party providers to remedy vulnerabilities or
security defects, or customers not deploying security releases or deciding not to upgrade products,
services or solutions could result in claims of liability against us, damage our reputation, or
otherwise materially harm our business.
The products and services we sell to customers, and our cloud-based solutions, inevitably contain
vulnerabilities or critical security defects which have not been remedied and cannot be disclosed
without compromising security. We also make prioritization decisions in determining which
vulnerabilities or security defects to fix and the timing of these fixes. Customers may also need to
test security releases before they can be deployed which can delay implementation. In addition, we
rely on third-party providers of software and cloud-based services, and we cannot control the rate at
which they remedy vulnerabilities. When customers do not deploy specific releases, or decide not to
upgrade to the latest versions of our products, services or cloud-based solutions containing the
release, they may be left vulnerable. Vulnerabilities and critical security defects, prioritization
errors in remedying vulnerabilities or security defects, failure of third-party providers to remedy
vulnerabilities or security defects, or customers not deploying specific releases or deciding not to
upgrade products, services or solutions could result in claims of liability against us, damage our
reputation or otherwise materially harm our business.
Our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially harmed by regulatory
uncertainty applicable to our products and services.
Changes in regulatory requirements applicable to the industries in which we operate, in the United
States and in other countries, could materially affect the sales of our products and services. In
particular, changes in telecommunications regulations could impact our service provider customers’
purchase of our products and offers, and they could also impact sales of our own regulated offers. In
addition, evolving legal requirements restricting or controlling the collection, processing, or
cross-border transmission of data, including regulation of cloud-based services, could materially
affect our customers’ ability to use, and our ability to sell, our products and offers. Additional
areas of uncertainty that could impact sales of our products and offers include laws and regulations
related to encryption technology, environmental sustainability (including climate change), export
control,
 26 
Table of Contents
product certification, and national security controls applicable to our supply chain. For example,
new laws and regulations in response to climate change could result in increased energy efficiency
for our products and increased compliance and energy costs. Changes in regulatory requirements in any
of these areas could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial
condition.
 Risks Related to Ownership of Our Stock 
 Our stock price may be volatile. 
Historically, our common stock has experienced substantial price volatility, particularly as a result
of variations between our actual financial results and the published expectations of analysts and as
a result of announcements by our competitors and us. Furthermore, speculation in the press or
investment community about our strategic position, financial condition, results of operations,
business, security of our products, or significant transactions can cause changes in our stock price.
In addition, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have
affected the market price of many technology companies, in particular, and that have often been
unrelated to the operating performance of these companies. These factors, as well as general economic
and political conditions and the announcement of proposed and completed acquisitions or other
significant transactions, or any difficulties associated with such transactions, by us or our current
or potential competitors, may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock in the
future. Additionally, volatility, lack of positive performance in our stock price or changes to our
overall compensation program, including our stock incentive program, may adversely affect our ability
to retain key employees, virtually all of whom are compensated, in part, based on the performance of
our stock price.
 Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments 
None.
 Item 2. Properties 
Our corporate headquarters are located at an owned site in San Jose, California, in the United States
of America. The locations of our headquarters by geographic segment are as follows:
 Americas EMEA APJC 
 San Jose, California, USA Amsterdam, Netherlands Singapore 
In addition to our headquarters site, we own additional sites in the United States, which include
facilities in the surrounding areas of San Jose, California; Research Triangle Park, North Carolina;
Richardson, Texas; and Lawrenceville, Georgia. We also own land for expansion in some of these
locations. In addition, we lease office space in many U.S. locations.
Outside the United States our operations are conducted primarily in leased sites. Other significant
sites (in addition to the two non-U.S. headquarters locations) are located in Australia, Belgium,
Canada, China, Germany, India, Japan, Mexico, Poland, and the United Kingdom.
We believe that our existing facilities, including both owned and leased, are in good condition and
suitable for the conduct of our business.
