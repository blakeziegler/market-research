 Our Company 
NVIDIA pioneered accelerated computing to help solve the most challenging computational problems.
Since our original focus on PC graphics, we have expanded to several other large and important
computationally intensive fields. Fueled by the sustained demand for exceptional 3D graphics and the
scale of the gaming market, NVIDIA has leveraged its GPU architecture to create platforms for
scientific computing, artificial intelligence, or AI, data science, autonomous vehicles, or AV,
robotics, and augmented and virtual reality, or AR and VR.
The GPU was initially used to simulate human imagination, enabling the virtual worlds of video games
and films. Today, it also simulates human intelligence, enabling a deeper understanding of the
physical world. Its parallel processing capabilities, supported by up to thousands of computing
cores, are essential to running deep learning algorithms. This form of AI, in which software writes
itself by learning from data, can serve as the brain of computers, robots and self-driving cars that
can perceive and understand the world. GPU-powered deep learning is being adopted by thousands of
enterprises to deliver services and products that would have been impossible with traditional coding.
NVIDIA has a platform strategy, bringing together hardware, software, algorithms, libraries, systems,
and services to create unique value for the markets we serve. While the requirements of these end
markets are diverse, we address them with a unified underlying architecture leveraging our GPUs and
software stacks. The programmable nature of our architecture allows us to support several multi-
billion-dollar end markets with the same underlying technology by using a variety of software stacks
developed either internally or by third party developers and partners. The large and growing number
of developers across our platforms strengthens our ecosystem and increases the value of our platform
to our customers.
Innovation is at our core. We have invested over $24 billion in research and development since our
inception, yielding inventions that are essential to modern computing. Our invention of the GPU in
1999 defined modern computer graphics and established NVIDIA as the leader in visual computing. With
our introduction of the CUDA programming model in 2006, we opened the parallel processing
capabilities of the GPU for general purpose computing. This approach significantly accelerates the
most demanding high-performance computing, or HPC, applications in fields such as aerospace, bio-
science research, mechanical and fluid simulations, and energy exploration. Today, our GPUs power
many of the fastest supercomputers across the world. In addition, the massively parallel compute
architecture of our GPUs and associated software are well suited for deep learning and machine
learning, powering the era of AI. While traditional CPU-based approaches no longer deliver advances
on the pace described by Moore’s Law, we deliver GPU performance improvements on a pace ahead of
Moore’s Law, giving the industry a path forward.
Gamers choose NVIDIA GPUs to enjoy immersive, increasingly cinematic virtual worlds. GPUs also help
underpin the world’s fastest growing spectator sport, eSports, which attracts hundreds of millions of
viewers to watch top-quality gaming. In addition to serving the growing number of gamers, the market
for gaming GPUs is expanding as a result of the burgeoning population of live streamers,
broadcasters, artists and creators.
Researchers use our GPUs to accelerate a wide range of important applications, from simulating
molecular dynamics to weather forecasting. With support for more than over 600 applications -
including the top 15 HPC applications - NVIDIA GPUs enable some of the most promising areas of
discovery, from weather prediction to materials science and from wind tunnel simulation to genomics.
NVIDIA GPUs power the top supercomputers in the United States and Europe. Including GPUs and
networking, NVIDIA powers nearly 70%, and 8 of the top 10, supercomputers on the global TOP500 list.
The world’s leading cloud service providers and consumer internet companies use our GPUs to enable,
accelerate or enrich the services they deliver to billions of end-users, including search, social
networking, online shopping, live video, translation, AI assistants, navigation, and cloud computing.
A rapidly growing number of enterprises and startups across a broad range of industries use our GPUs
and AI software to bring automation to the products and services they build. For example, the
transportation industry is turning to our platforms for AV; the healthcare industry is leveraging

rendering. Our DesignWorks software delivers this to designers and enables an architect designing a
building with a computer-aided design package to interact with the model in real time, view it in
greater detail, and generate photorealistic renderings for the client. It also allows an automotive
designer to create a highly realistic 3D image of a car, which can be viewed from all angles,
reducing reliance on costly, time-consuming full-scale clay models.
Our Professional Visualization platforms are critical enablers in many fields, such as design and
manufacturing and digital content creation. Design and manufacturing encompass computer-aided design,
architectural design, consumer-products manufacturing, medical instrumentation, and aerospace.
Digital content creation includes professional video editing and post-production, special effects for
films, and broadcast-television graphics.
The NVIDIA RTX platform makes it possible to render film-quality, photorealistic objects and
environments with physically accurate shadows, reflections and refractions using ray tracing in real-
time. Many leading 3D design and content creation applications developed by our ecosystem partners
now support RTX, allowing professionals to accelerate and transform their workflows with NVIDIA RTX
GPUs.
Just as VR is becoming more important in gaming, it is also being incorporated in a growing number of
enterprise applications. Virtual car showrooms, surgical training, architectural walkthroughs, and

In the field of AI, NVIDIA’s platform accelerates both deep learning and machine learning workloads.
Deep learning is a computer science approach where neural networks are trained to recognize patterns
from massive amounts of data in the form of images, sounds and text - in some instances better than
humans. Machine learning is a related approach that leverages algorithms as well as data to learn how
to make determinations or predictions, often used in data science. HPC, also referred to as
scientific computing, uses numerical computational approaches to solve large and complex problems.
For both AI and HPC applications, the NVIDIA accelerated computing platform greatly increases the
performance and power efficiency of high-performance computers and data centers.
We are engaged with thousands of organizations working on AI in a multitude of industries, from
automating tasks such as reading medical images, to enabling fraud detection in financial services,
to optimizing oil exploration and drilling. These organizations include the world’s leading consumer
internet and cloud services companies, which are using AI for critical tasks such as natural language
processing and recommendation systems; enterprises that are increasingly turning to AI to improve
products and services; and startups seeking to implement AI in transformative ways across multiple
industries. We partnered with industry leaders such as IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, SAP, and VMware to
bring AI to enterprise users. We also have partnerships in transportation, retail, healthcare and
manufacturing, among others, to accelerate the adoption of AI.

platform. The in-vehicle platform consists of the high-performance, energy efficient DRIVE AGX
computing hardware, and open, modular software, including DRIVE AV for autonomous driving and DRIVE
IX for in-vehicle intelligent experience and AI assistants.
NVIDIA DRIVE can perceive and understand in real-time what is happening around the vehicle, precisely
locate itself on an HD map, and plan a safe path forward. This advanced self-driving car platform
combines deep learning, sensor fusion, and surround vision to change the driving experience. Our
DRIVE platform scales from a palm-sized, energy-efficient module for automated highway-driving
capabilities to a configuration with multiple systems aimed at enabling driverless cars. Our Xavier
system-on-a-chip, or SoC, which started shipping in 2018, enables vehicles to use deep neural
networks to process data from multiple cameras and sensors. It powers the DRIVE AutoPilot, NVIDIA’s
Level 2+ automated driving solution, combining the DRIVE AV self-driving solution with the DRIVE IX
cockpit software, including a visualization system for allowing the driver to see what the car sees
and plans to do. In fiscal year 2020, we announced our next-generation SoC, Orin.
In addition, we offer a scalable data center-based simulation solution, NVIDIA DRIVE Constellation
running DRIVE Sim software, for testing and validating a self-driving platform before commercial

 Business Strategies 
NVIDIA’s key strategies that shape our overall business approach include:
Advancing the NVIDIA accelerated computing platform. NVIDIA’s accelerated computing platform can
solve complex problems in significantly less time and with lower power consumption than alternative
computational approaches. Indeed, it can help solve problems that were previously deemed unsolvable.
We work to deliver continued performance leaps that outpace Moore’s Law by leveraging innovation
across the architecture, chip design, system, and software layers. With our acquisition of Mellanox
in fiscal year 2021, we strengthened our end-to-end expertise in data center architectures,
positioning us for a future when the data center is the new unit of computing. This full-stack
innovation approach allows us to deliver order-of-magnitude performance advantages relative to legacy
approaches in our target markets, which include Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and
Automotive. While the requirements of these end markets are diverse, we address them with a unified
underlying architecture leveraging our GPUs and CUDA as the fundamental building blocks. The
programmable nature of our architecture allows us to make leveraged investments in R&D: we can
support several multi-billion-dollar end markets with the same underlying technology by using a
variety of software stacks developed either internally or by third party developers and partners. We
utilize this platform approach in each of our target markets.
Extending our technology and platform leadership in AI. We provide a complete, end-to-end accelerated
computing platform for deep learning and machine learning, addressing both training and inferencing.
This includes GPUs, interconnects, systems, our CUDA programming language, algorithms, libraries, and
other software. GPUs are uniquely suited to AI, and we will continue to add AI-specific features to
our GPU architecture to further extend our leadership position. Our AI technology leadership is
reinforced by our large and expanding ecosystem in a virtuous cycle. Our GPU platforms are available
from virtually every major server maker and cloud service provider, as well as on our own AI
supercomputer. There are over 2.2 million developers worldwide using CUDA and our other software
tools to help deploy our technology in our target markets. We evangelize AI through partnerships with
hundreds of universities and more than 7,000 startups through our Inception program. Additionally,
our Deep Learning Institute provides instruction on the latest techniques on how to design, train,
and deploy neural networks in applications using our accelerated computing platform.
Extending our technology and platform leadership in visual computing. We believe that visual
computing is fundamental to the continued expansion and evolution of computing. We apply our research
and development resources to extending our leadership in visual computing, enabling us to enhance the
user experience for consumer entertainment and professional visualization applications. Our
technologies are instrumental in driving gaming forward, as developers leverage our libraries and
algorithms to create near-cinematic and VR experiences. Our close collaboration with game developers
allows us to deliver an optimized gaming experience on our GeForce platform. Our GeForce Experience
gaming application further enhances each gamer’s experience by optimizing their PC’s settings, as
well as enabling the recording and sharing of gameplay. We also enable interactive graphics
applications - such as games, movie and photo editing and design software - to be accessed by almost
any device, almost anywhere, through our cloud platforms such as GRID for enterprise and GeForce NOW
for gaming.
Advancing the leading autonomous vehicle platform. We believe the advent of AV will soon
revolutionize the transportation industry. In our view, AI is the key technology enabler of this
opportunity, as the algorithms required for autonomous driving - such as perception, localization,
and planning - are too complex for legacy hand-coded approaches and will run on multiple trained
neural networks instead. Therefore, we provide a full functionally safe AI-based hardware and
software solution for the AV market under the DRIVE brand, which we are bringing to market through
our partnerships with automotive original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, tier-1 suppliers, and
start-ups. Our AV solution also includes the GPU-based hardware required to train the neural networks
before their in-vehicle deployment, as well as to re-simulate their operation prior to any over-the-
air software updates. We believe our comprehensive, top-to-bottom and end-to-end approach will enable
the transportation industry to solve the complex problems arising from the shift to autonomous
driving.
Leveraging our intellectual property. We believe our intellectual property is a valuable asset that
can be accessed by our customers and partners through license and development agreements when they
desire to build such capabilities directly into their own products, or have us do so through a custom
development. Such license and development arrangements can further enhance the reach of our
technology.
 Sales and Marketing 
Our worldwide sales and marketing strategy is key to achieving our objective of providing markets
with our high-performance and efficient computing platforms. Our sales and marketing teams, located
across our global markets, work closely with end customers and various industry ecosystems through
our partner network. Our partner network
 8 
 Table of Contents 
incorporates each industry's respective OEMs, original device manufacturers, or ODMs, system
builders, add-in board manufacturers, or AIBs, retailers/distributors, internet and cloud service
providers, automotive manufacturers and tier-1 automotive suppliers, mapping companies, start-ups,
and other ecosystem participants.
Members of our sales team have technical expertise and product and industry knowledge. We also employ
a team of application engineers to assist our partner network in designing, testing, and qualifying
system designs that incorporate our platforms. We believe that the depth and quality of our design
support are key to improving our partner network’s time-to-market, maintaining a high level of
customer satisfaction, and fostering relationships that encourage our end customers and partner
network to use the next generation of our products within each platform.
To encourage the development of applications optimized for our platforms, we seek to establish and
maintain strong relationships in the software development community. Engineering and marketing
personnel engage with key software developers to promote and discuss our platforms, as well as to
ascertain individual product requirements and solve technical problems. Our developer program makes
our products available to developers prior to launch in order to encourage the development of AI
frameworks, SDKs, and APIs for software applications and game titles that are optimized for our
platforms. Our Deep Learning Institute provides in-person and online training for developers in
industries and organizations around the world to build AI and accelerated computing applications that
leverage our platforms.
As NVIDIA’s business has evolved from a focus primarily on gaming products to broader markets, and
from chips to platforms and complete systems, so, too, have our avenues to market. Thus, in addition
to sales to customers in our partner network, certain of our platforms are also sold through e-tail
channels, or direct to cloud service providers and enterprise customers.
 Seasonality 
Our computing platforms serve a diverse set of markets such as enterprise and cloud data centers,
consumer gaming, professional workstations, and automotive. Our consumer products typically see
stronger revenue in the second half of our fiscal year. In addition, based on the production
schedules of key customers, some of our products for notebooks and game consoles typically generate
stronger revenue in the second and third quarters, and weaker revenue in the fourth and first
quarters. However, there can be no assurance that this trend will continue.
 Manufacturing 
We do not directly manufacture semiconductors used for our products. Instead, we utilize a fabless
manufacturing strategy, whereby we employ world-class suppliers for all phases of the manufacturing
process, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing, and packaging. This strategy uses the
expertise of industry-leading suppliers that are certified by the International Organization for
Standardization in such areas as fabrication, assembly, quality control and assurance, reliability,
and testing. Additionally, we can avoid many of the significant costs and risks associated with
owning and operating manufacturing operations. While we may directly procure certain raw materials
used in the production of our products, such as substrates and a variety of components, our suppliers
are responsible for procurement of most of the raw materials used in the production of our products.
As a result, we can focus our resources on product design, additional quality assurance, marketing,
and customer support.
We utilize industry-leading suppliers, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited and
Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd, to produce our semiconductor wafers. We then utilize independent
subcontractors, such as Amkor Technology, BYD Auto Co. Ltd., Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., King
Yuan Electronics Co., Ltd., Omni Logistics, LLC and Siliconware Precision Industries Company Ltd. to
perform assembly, testing, and packaging of most of our products and platforms. We use contract
manufacturers such as Flex Ltd. to manufacture our standard and custom adapter card products and
switch systems, and Fabrinet to manufacture our cables. We purchase substrates from Ibiden Co. Ltd.,
Kinsus Interconnect Technology Corporation, and Unimicron Technology Corporation, and memory from
Micron Technology, Samsung Semiconductor, Inc., and SK Hynix.
We typically receive semiconductor products from our subcontractors, perform incoming quality
assurance and configuration, and then ship the semiconductors to contract equipment manufacturers, or
CEMs, distributors, motherboard and add-in card, or AIC, customers from our third-party warehouse in
Hong Kong, Israel, and the United States. Generally, these manufacturers assemble and test the boards
based on our design kit and test specifications, and then ship our products to retailers, system
builders, or OEMs as motherboard and AIC solutions.
We also utilize industry-leading contract manufacturers, or CMs, such as Flex Ltd. and Fabrinet, and
ODMs such as Wistron Corporation, to manufacture some of our products for sale directly to end
customers. In those cases, key
 9 
 Table of Contents 
elements such as the GPU, SoC, memory, and integrated circuit are often consigned by us to the CMs,
who are responsible for the procurement of other components used in the production process.
 Competition 
The market for our products is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological
change and evolving industry standards. We believe that the principal competitive factors in this
market are performance, breadth of product offerings, access to customers and partners and
distribution channels, software support, conformity to industry standard APIs, manufacturing
capabilities, processor pricing, and total system costs. We believe that our ability to remain
competitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and functions that
customers and partners will demand and whether we are able to deliver consistent volumes of our
products at acceptable levels of quality and at competitive prices. We expect competition to increase
from both existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be lower priced than
ours, or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by our products. In
addition, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire
significant market share.
A significant source of competition comes from companies that provide or intend to provide GPUs,
including Intel’s recent announcement that they will introduce high performance GPUs, embedded SOCs,
and other accelerated, AI computing processor products, and providers of semiconductor-based high-
performance interconnect products based on InfiniBand, Ethernet, Fibre Channel and proprietary
technologies. Some of our competitors may have greater marketing, financial, distribution and
manufacturing resources than we do and may be more able to adapt to customer or technological
changes. We expect an increasingly competitive environment in our fiscal year 2022.
Our current competitors include:
• suppliers and licensors designing discrete and integrated GPUs and other accelerated computing
solutions, including chipsets that incorporate 3D graphics, or HPC, such as Advanced Micro Devices,
or AMD, Intel Corporation, and Xilinx, Inc.;
• large internet services companies with internal teams designing chips that incorporates HPC or

 Patents and Proprietary Rights 
We rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party
nondisclosure agreements, and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property in the
United States and internationally. Our currently issued patents have expiration dates from March 2021
to June 2045. We have numerous patents issued, allowed, and pending in the United States and in
foreign jurisdictions. Our patents and pending patent applications primarily relate to our products
and the technology used in connection with our products. We also rely on international treaties,
organizations, and foreign laws to protect our intellectual property. The laws of certain foreign
countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold, including various countries in
Asia, may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of
the United States. This decreased protection makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and
products more likely. We continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for
particular innovations and technologies based on such factors as:
• the location in which our products are manufactured;
• our strategic technology or product directions in different countries;
• the degree to which intellectual property laws exist and are meaningfully enforced in different
jurisdictions; and
• the commercial significance of our operations and our competitors' operations in particular
countries and regions.

were engaged in research and development and 5,443 were engaged in sales, marketing, operations, and
administrative positions.
To be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully, we must recruit, develop, and
retain talented employees, including qualified executives, scientists, engineers, technical staff,
and research and development personnel. The primary ways in which we seek to do this are summarized
below, in addition to an overview of employee programs we implemented in response to the COVID-19
pandemic.
 Recruitment 
The demand for talent in new markets, such as AI and deep learning, is increasingly competitive. Our
intern and new college graduate recruiting programs are a sustainable source of talent. We partner
with higher education institutions globally to develop our candidate pipelines, recruit at industry
conferences, and encourage our employees to submit referrals, with over 36% of hires coming from
internal recommendations. Collaborations with our community resource groups improve how we reach and
attract minority candidates.
 Development and Retention 
To support employee advancement, we provide training on-the-job through coaching, feedback, and role
modeling. We have a rich library of live and on-demand learning experiences such as workshops, panel
discussions, speaker-based forums, and internally focused technical conferences. We curate learning
libraries around our most common development needs, provide the latest technical platforms to support
self-paced learning, and regularly listen to learner feedback through internal messaging channels to
improve and update those topics. We offer tuition reimbursement programs and subsidize advanced
technical education programs and online technical certifications. We encourage internal mobility
through career expos and coaching, as well as foster mentorship connections and provide trained
coaches as additional developmental support. Our strong partnerships with internal community resource
groups allow us to personalize programs to address specific career development needs.
To evaluate employee sentiment and engagement, we use several listening mechanisms such as pulse
surveys, a suggestion box, and an anonymous third-party hotline.
In fiscal year 2021, our overall turnover rate was 3.8%.
 Compensation, Benefits, and Well-Being 
Our compensation program rewards performance and is structured to encourage employees to invest in
the company’s future. Employees receive equity (except where unavailable due to local regulations)
that is tied to the value of our stock price and vests over time to retain employees while
simultaneously aligning their interests with those of our stockholders.
We offer comprehensive benefits to support our employees’ and their families’ well-being, including
401(k) programs in the U.S., statutory pension programs outside the U.S., our employee stock purchase
program, flexible work hours and time off, and programs to address mental health, stress, and time-
management challenges. We evaluate our benefit offerings globally and are committed to providing
tailored benefits based on community needs, including assistance for military members, additional

 Diversity and Inclusion 
 11 
 Table of Contents 
We believe that diverse teams fuel innovation, and we are committed to creating an inclusive culture
that supports all employees, regardless of gender, gender identity or expression, veteran status,
race, ethnicity, or ability.
We have increased our efforts to recruit, develop, and retain a more diverse workforce with a focus
on those historically underrepresented in the technology field, including women, Black, and Hispanic
candidates. In fiscal year 2021, we created the role of Head of Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging,
along with hiring a global diversity recruiting leader, and a Head of Strategic Initiatives to build
our developer ecosystem and ensure it represents the global population.
Efforts we are undertaking include:
• Shepherding underrepresented candidates through the interviewing process, engaging employees from
underrepresented communities for recruiting events and interview panels, and increased investment in
minority-serving institutions and professional organizations.
• Developing an internal slate of diverse talent for all open management positions, beginning semi-
annual talent review sessions with executives to identify internal, diverse talent, and forming
sponsorship and career acceleration programs.
• Increasing inclusion communications and pulse surveys to measure employee sentiment.
As of January 31, 2021, our global workforce was 80% male and 20% female, and 6% of our workforce in
the United States was composed of Black or African American, and Hispanic or Latino employees.
 Safety and COVID-19 
We support our people and their families in making their health a top priority. We implemented global
protocols to slow the spread of COVID-19 and to keep our workforce safe by closing our offices around
the world in March 2020 for all except essential workers. We also eliminated most business travel. We
provided our employees with resources to work remotely and continued to pay all employees and
contractors. For essential labs and offices that remain open, we instituted appropriate safety
protocols and social distancing guidelines. Additionally, we provided resources for employees,
including work from home support, enhanced health coverage, reimbursement for certain work from home
expenses, and learning and development resources on how to lead and manage remotely.

│ ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS │
In evaluating NVIDIA and our business, the following factors should be considered in addition to the
other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Before you buy our common stock, you should
know that making such an investment involves risks including, but not limited to, the risks described
below. Any one of the following risks could harm our business, financial condition, results of
operations or reputation, which could cause our stock price to decline, and you may lose all or a
part of your investment. Additional risks, trends and uncertainties not presently known to us or that
we currently believe are immaterial may also harm our business, financial condition, results of
operations or reputation.
 Risks Related to Our Industry and Markets 
If we fail to meet the evolving needs of our markets, or to identify new products, services or
technologies, our revenue and financial results may be adversely impacted.
Our GPU-based visual and accelerated computing platforms address four large markets: Gaming,
Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. These markets often experience rapid
technological change, changes in customer requirements, new product introductions and enhancements,
and evolving industry standards. Our success depends on our ability to identify emerging industry
changes and to develop new (or enhance our existing) products, services and technologies that meet
the evolving needs of these markets. Such activities may require considerable technical, financial,
compliance, sales and marketing investments. We devote significant resources to the development of
technologies and business offerings in markets where we have a limited operating history, such as the
automotive and data center markets, which presents additional risks to our business. For example, we
must continue to accurately forecast demand, scale and optimize utilization in our data center
business, and develop and deliver next-generation autonomous driving solutions to our partners and
customers or our business could be negatively impacted. We also must continue to scale our networking
business following the Mellanox acquisition by leveraging our joint product capabilities and
continuing to effectively integrate company processes. We must also continue to develop the
infrastructure needed to scale our business in these areas, including customer service and support,
e-commerce and intellectual property, or IP, licensing capabilities. If we do not continue to evolve
our business, including by developing
 13 
 Table of Contents 
market specific technologies, managing the social and environmental impact of our products and
technologies, expanding the ecosystem for our current and future products and technologies, and
monetizing and expanding our business in various areas, our financial results could be negatively
impacted. We also must meet customer safety and compliance standards, which are subject to change,
including those applicable to our automotive solutions and systems. Additionally, we continue to make
considerable investments in research and development, which may not produce significant revenue for
several years, if at all. If our investments are unsuccessful and we fail to develop new products,
services and technologies, or if we focus on technologies that do not become widely adopted, our
business, revenue, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. We
cannot assure you that our strategic direction will result in innovative products and technologies
that provide value to our customers, partners, and ultimately, our shareholders. If we fail to
anticipate the changing needs of our target markets and emerging technology trends, or if we do not
appropriately adapt our strategies as market conditions evolve, in a timely manner to exploit
potential market opportunities, our business will be harmed.
For our products that we do not sell directly to consumers, achieving design wins is an important
success factor, including for our interconnect products. Achieving design wins may involve a lengthy
process in pursuit of a customer opportunity and depend on our ability to anticipate features and
functionality that customers and consumers will demand. Failure to obtain a particular design win may
prevent us from obtaining design wins in subsequent generations of a particular product. This could
result in lost revenue and could weaken our position in future competitive bid selection processes.
Unanticipated changes in industry standards could render our products incompatible with products
developed by major hardware manufacturers and software developers. Additionally, if our products are
not in compliance with prevailing industry standards, including safety standards, our customers may
not incorporate our products into their design strategies. Furthermore, winning a product design does
not guarantee sales to a customer or that we will realize as much revenue as anticipated, if any.
Competition in our current and target markets could prevent us from growing our revenue.
Our target markets remain extremely competitive, and we expect competition to intensify as current
competitors expand their product and/or service offerings, industry standards continue to evolve,
customer needs change and new competitors enter these markets. Our competitors’ products, services
and technologies may be less costly, or may offer superior functionality or better features, than
ours, which may result, among other things, in lower than expected selling prices for our products.
In addition, some of our competitors operate and maintain their own fabrication facilities, have
longer operating histories, larger customer bases, more comprehensive IP portfolios and patent
protections, and greater financial, sales, marketing and distribution resources than we do. These
competitors may be able to more effectively identify and capitalize upon opportunities in new markets
and end user customer trends, quickly transition their products, including semiconductor products, to
increasingly smaller line width geometries, and obtain sufficient foundry capacity and packaging
materials, which could harm our business. In our networking business, some of our customers are also
integrated circuit and switch suppliers and already have in-house expertise and internal development
capabilities similar to ours. Licensing our technology and supporting such customers entails the
transfer of intellectual property rights that may enable such customers to develop their own products
and solutions to replace those we are currently providing to them. Consequently, these customers may
become competitors to us. Further, each new design by a customer presents a competitive situation. If
we are unable to successfully compete in our target markets, respond to changes in our target markets
or introduce new offerings to meet the needs of this competitive environment, including in
significant international markets such as China, demand for our products, services and technologies
could decrease, which would cause our revenue to decline and cause our results of operations to
suffer. In addition, the competitive landscape in our target markets has changed and may continue to
evolve due to a trend toward consolidation, which could lead to fewer customers, partners, or
suppliers, any of which could negatively affect our financial results.
 Risks Related to Our Supply and Manufacturing 
We depend on third parties and their technology to manufacture, assemble, test and/or package our
products, which reduces our control over product quantity and quality, manufacturing yields,
development, enhancement and product delivery schedule and could harm our business.
We do not manufacture the silicon wafers used for our products and do not own or operate a wafer
fabrication facility. Instead, we are dependent on industry-leading foundries, such as Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., to manufacture our
semiconductor wafers using their fabrication equipment and techniques. Similarly, we do not directly
assemble, test or package our products, but instead rely on independent subcontractors. In the past
we have not had and going forward we may not have long-term commitment contracts with these foundries
or subcontractors. Nevertheless, we may enter into long-term procurement and capacity commitments
 14 
 Table of Contents 
as our business grows or in periods with limited availability of capacity and components in our
supply chain. As our business grows, we must continue to scale and adapt our supply chain or it could
have an adverse impact on our business. As a result, we face several significant risks which could
have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand, scale our supply chain and/or
negatively impact our business operations, gross margin, revenue and/or financial results, including:
• a lack of guaranteed supply of wafers and other components and potential higher wafer and component
prices, which could be impacted by our failure to correctly estimate demand and to place orders with
our suppliers in sufficient quantities and/or in a timely manner;
• a failure by our foundries to procure raw materials or to provide or allocate adequate, or any,
manufacturing or test capacity for our products;
• a failure by our foundries to develop, obtain or successfully implement high quality, leading-edge
process technologies, including transitions to smaller geometry process technologies such as advanced
process node technologies and memory designs needed to manufacture our products profitably or on a
timely basis;
• a limited number of suppliers, including foundries, assembly and test providers, and memory
manufacturers;
• loss of a supplier and additional expense and/or production delays as a result of qualifying a new
foundry or subcontractor and commencing volume production or testing in the event of a loss of or a
decision to add or change a supplier;
• a lack of direct control over delivery schedules or product quantity and quality; and
• delays in product shipments, shortages, a decrease in product quality and/or higher expenses in the
event our subcontractors or foundries prioritize our competitors’ orders over our orders or
otherwise.
In addition, low manufacturing yields could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer
demand, increase manufacturing costs, harm customer or partner relationships, and/or negatively
impact our business operations, gross margin, revenue and/or financial results. Manufacturing yields
for our products are a function of product design, which is developed largely by us, and process
technology, which typically is proprietary to the foundry. Low yields may result from either product
design or process technology failure. We do not know whether a yield problem will exist until our
design is actually manufactured by the foundry. As a result, yield problems may not be identified
until well into the manufacturing process and require us and the foundry to cooperate to resolve the
problem.
We also rely on third-party software development tools to assist us in the design, simulation and
verification of new products or product enhancements, and to bring such new products and enhancements
to market in a timely manner. In the past, we have experienced delays in the introduction of products
and enhancements as a result of the inability of then available software development tools to fully
simulate the complex features and functionalities of our products. The design requirements necessary
to meet consumer demands for more features and greater functionality from our products may exceed the
capabilities of available software development tools. If we miss design cycles or lose design wins
due to the unavailability of such software development tools, we could lose market share and our
revenues could decline. If we fail to achieve design wins for our products, our business will be
harmed.
If our products contain significant defects, we could incur significant expenses to remediate such
defects, our reputation could be damaged, and we could lose market share.
Our products, including both hardware and software offerings, are complex and may contain defects or
security vulnerabilities, or experience failures or unsatisfactory performance due to any number of
issues in design, fabrication, packaging, materials and/or use within a system. These risks may
increase as our products are introduced into new devices, markets, technologies and applications,
including into the automotive market, or as new versions are released. Some errors in our products or
services may only be discovered after a product or service has been shipped or used by customers or
the end users of such product. Undiscovered vulnerabilities in our products or services could expose
our customers or end users to hackers or other unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy
viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that could attack our products or services.
Failure of our products to perform to specifications, or other product defects, could lead to
substantial damage to the products we sell directly to customers, the end product in which our device
has been integrated by OEMs, ODMs, AIBs and Tier 1 automotive suppliers, and to the user of such end
product. Any such defect may cause us to incur significant warranty, support and repair or
replacement costs, write-off the value of related inventory, cause us to lose market share, and
divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts to find and
correct the issue. In addition, an error or defect in new products or releases or related software
drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in
 15 
 Table of Contents 
failure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design wins, harm our relationships with customers
and partners and harm consumers’ perceptions of our brand. Also, we may be required to reimburse our
customers, partners or consumers, including costs to repair or replace products in the field. A
product recall, including automotive recalls or recalls due to a bug in our products, or a
significant number of product returns could be expensive, damage our reputation, harm our ability to
attract new customers, result in the shifting of business to our competitors and result in litigation
against us, such as product liability suits. If a product liability claim is brought against us, the
cost of defending the claim could be significant and would divert the efforts of our technical and
management personnel, and harm our business. Further, our business liability insurance may be
inadequate or future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable terms, which could adversely impact
our financial results.
 Risks Related to Our Operating Business 
If we fail to estimate customer demand properly, our financial results could be harmed.
Our products are manufactured based on estimates of customers’ future demand and our manufacturing
lead times are very long. This could lead to a significant mismatch between supply and demand, giving
rise to product shortages or excess inventory, and make our demand forecast more uncertain. We sell
many of our products through a channel model, and our channel customers sell to retailers,
distributors, and/or end customers. As a result, the decisions made by our channel partners,
retailers, and distributors in response to changing market conditions and the changing demand for our
products could impact our financial results. In order to have shorter shipment lead times and quicker
delivery schedules for our customers, we may build inventory for anticipated periods of growth which
do not occur, may build inventory anticipating demand that does not materialize, or may build
inventory to serve what we believe is pent-up demand. In periods with limited availability of
capacity and components in our supply chain, we may place non-cancellable inventory orders
significantly in advance of our normal lead times, pay premiums or provide deposits to secure normal
and incremental future supply, which could negatively impact our financial results. Demand for our
products is based on many factors, including our product introductions and transitions, competitor
announcements, and competing technologies, all of which can impact the timing and amount of our
revenue. For example, our GPUs for gaming are capable of digital currency mining. Demand and use of
GPUs for cryptocurrency has fluctuated in the past and is likely to continue to change quickly.
Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including changes in the prices of cryptocurrencies, can
impact demand for our products and our ability to estimate demand for our products. Changes to
cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not limited to, the pending Ethereum 2.0
standard may also create increased aftermarket resales of our GPUs and may reduce demand for our new
GPUs. Additionally, consumer behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as increased demand for our
Gaming, Data Center and mobile workstation and laptop products and suppressed corporate demand for
desktop workstations, has made it more difficult for us to estimate future demand, and these
challenges may be more pronounced in the future if and when the effects of the pandemic subside. In
estimating demand, we make multiple assumptions, any of which may prove to be incorrect. If we are
unable to accurately anticipate demand for our products, our business and financial results could be
adversely impacted. Situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include:
• changes in business and economic conditions, including downturns in our target markets and/or
overall economy;
• changes in consumer confidence caused by changes in market conditions, including changes in the
credit market;
• a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products;
• a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology or customer
requirements;
• our introduction of new products resulting in lower demand for older products;
• less demand than expected for newly-introduced products; or
• increased competition, including competitive pricing actions.
The cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess
inventory, which could adversely affect our gross margins. In addition, because we often sell a
substantial portion of our products in the last month of each quarter, we may not be able to reduce
our inventory purchase commitments in a timely manner in response to customer cancellations or
deferrals. We could be required to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable
value or excess inventory, and we could experience a reduction in average selling prices if we
incorrectly forecast product demand, any of which could harm our financial results.
 16 
 Table of Contents 
Conversely, if we underestimate our customers' demand for our products, our foundry partners may not
have adequate lead-time or capacity to increase production and we may not be able to obtain
sufficient inventory to fill customers' orders on a timely basis. We may also face supply constraints
caused by natural disasters or other events. In such cases, even if we are able to increase
production levels to meet customer demand, we may not be able to do so in a cost-effective or timely
manner. If we fail to fulfill our customers' orders on a timely basis, or at all, our customer
relationships could be damaged, we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be
damaged.
System security and data protection breaches, as well as cyber-attacks, could disrupt our operations,
reduce our expected revenue and increase our expenses, which could adversely affect our stock price
and damage our reputation.
Security breaches, computer malware, phishing, and cyber-attacks have become more prevalent and
sophisticated in recent years. These threats are constantly evolving, making it increasingly
difficult to successfully defend against them or implement adequate preventative measures. These
attacks have occurred on our systems in the past and are expected to occur in the future. Experienced
computer programmers, hackers and employees may penetrate our security controls and misappropriate or
compromise our confidential information, or that of our employees or third parties. These attacks may
create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. These hackers may also develop and deploy viruses,
worms and other malicious software programs that attack or otherwise exploit security vulnerabilities
in our products, including consumer and automotive products, where we utilize over-the-air updates to
improve functionality over time. For portions of our IT infrastructure, including business management
and communication software products, we rely on products and services provided by third parties.
These providers may also experience breaches and attacks to their products which may impact our
systems. For example, in 2020, SolarWinds Inc., one of our third party software service providers,
was subject to a data security breach. To date, our investigations of this breach, which were
supported by a third party expert, have not identified any adverse impact to NVIDIA. Data security
breaches may also result from non-technical means, such as actions by an employee with access to our
systems. To defend against security threats, both to our internal systems and those of our customers,
we must continuously engineer more secure products and enhance security and reliability features,
which may result in increased expenses. We must also continue to develop security measures within
NVIDIA, ensure our suppliers have appropriate security measures in place, and continue to meet the
evolving security requirements of our customers or our business could be negatively impacted.
Actual or perceived breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure
or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us,
our partners, our customers or third parties could expose us and the parties affected to a risk of
loss or misuse of this information, resulting in litigation and potential liability, paying damages,
regulatory inquiries or actions, damage to our brand and reputation or other harm to our business.
Our efforts to prevent and overcome these challenges could increase our expenses and may not be
successful. We may experience interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of existing or
potential customers. Such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and
interrupt other critical functions. Delayed sales, lower margins or lost customers as a result of
these disruptions could adversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation.
Business disruptions could harm our business, lead to a decline in revenues and increase our costs.
Our worldwide operations could be disrupted by earthquakes, telecommunications failures, power or
water shortages, outages at cloud service providers, tsunamis, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires,
extreme weather conditions, cyber-attacks, terrorist attacks, medical epidemics or pandemics
(including, but not limited to, COVID-19) and other natural or man-made disasters, catastrophic
events or climate change. The occurrence of any of these disruptions could harm our business and
result in significant losses, a decline in revenue and an increase in our costs and expenses. Any of
these business disruptions could require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully
resume operations. Such risks are discussed further in the risk factor “The COVID-19 pandemic
continues to impact our business and could materially adversely affect our financial condition and
results of operations.” Our corporate headquarters, and a portion of our research and development
activities, are located in California, and other critical business operations, finished goods
inventory, and some of our suppliers are located in Asia, near major earthquake faults known for
seismic activity. In addition, a large portion of our current data center capacity is located in
California, making our operations vulnerable to natural disasters or other business disruptions
occurring in these geographical areas. The manufacture of product components, the final assembly of
our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations,
including Taiwan, China, Hong Kong, Israel and Korea. Additionally, a significant portion of our
finished goods product distribution occurs through Hong Kong, Israel and Taiwan. Geopolitical change
or changes in government regulations and policies in the United States or abroad may result in
changing regulatory requirements, trade policies, import duties and economic disruptions that could
impact our operating strategies, product demand, access to global markets, hiring, and profitability.
In particular, revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement
 17 
 Table of Contents 
could result in increased taxation, trade sanctions, the imposition of import duties or tariffs,
restrictions and controls on imports or exports, or other retaliatory actions, which could have an
adverse effect on our business plans or impact the timing of our shipments. For example, regulations
to implement the Export Control Reform Act of 2018 could have an adverse effect on our business
plans. Catastrophic events can also have an impact on third-party vendors who provide us critical
infrastructure services for IT and research and development systems and personnel. In addition,
geopolitical and domestic political developments, such as existing and potential trade wars,
political or social unrest, elections and post-election developments, and other events beyond our
control, can increase levels of political and economic unpredictability globally and increase the
volatility of global financial markets. Political instability, changes in government or adverse
political developments in or around any of the major countries in which we do business would also
likely harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our operations could be
harmed if manufacturing, logistics or other operations in these locations are disrupted for any
reason, including natural disasters, high heat events or water shortages, other negative impacts from
climate change, information technology system failures, military actions or economic, business,
labor, environmental, public health, regulatory or political issues. The ultimate impact on us, our
third-party foundries and other suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near major
earthquake faults and being consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown. In the event a
major earthquake or other disaster or catastrophic event affects us or the third-party systems on
which we rely, our business could be harmed as a result of declines in revenue, increases in
expenses, substantial expenditures and time spent to fully resume operations. All of these risks and
conditions could materially adversely affect our future sales and operating results.
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our business and could materially adversely affect our
financial condition and results of operations.
COVID-19 has spread worldwide, resulting in government authorities implementing numerous measures to
try to contain the disease, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place
orders and shutdowns. These measures have impacted, and may further impact, our workforce and
operations, the operations of our customers and our partners, and those of our respective vendors and
suppliers (including our subcontractors and third-party contract manufacturers). Our critical
business operations, including our headquarters, most of our finished goods inventory and many of our
key suppliers are located in regions which have been impacted by COVID-19. Our customers and
suppliers worldwide have also been affected and may continue to be affected by COVID-19 related
restrictions and closures.
The COVID-19 pandemic has increased economic and demand uncertainty. It continues to affect our
business in both positive and negative ways, and there is uncertainty around their duration and
impact. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021, our Gaming and Data Center market platforms
benefited from stronger demand as people continue to work, learn, and play from home. Our
Professional Visualization market platform benefited from work-from-home trends in mobile
workstations and desktop workstation demand has started to recover, although not back to pre-COVID
levels. In our Automotive market platform, COVID-19 did not have a significant impact on demand in
the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021. In some regions, markets, or industries, where COVID-19 has
driven an increase in sales for our products, the demand may not be sustainable if conditions change.
Additionally, stronger demand globally has limited the availability of capacity and components in our
supply chain, particularly in Gaming, which could cause us to order an excess amount if demand
changes, pay higher prices, or limit our ability to obtain supply at necessary levels or at all. As
the COVID-19 pandemic continues, the timing and overall demand from customers and the availability of
supply chain, logistical services and component supply may have a material net negative impact on our
business and financial results.
The manufacture of product components, the final assembly of our products and other critical
operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations, including Taiwan, China, Hong Kong,
Israel and Korea. A significant portion of our finished goods product distribution occurs through
Hong Kong, Israel and Taiwan. Additionally, our headquarters is located in California. Each of these
countries and locations has been affected by the pandemic and has taken measures to try to contain
it, including restrictions on manufacturing facilities, commerce, travel, on our support operations
or workforce, or on our customers, partners, vendors and suppliers. There is considerable uncertainty
regarding the impact of such measures and potential future measures. Such measures, as well as
restrictions or disruptions of transportation, such as reduced availability or increased cost of air
transport, port closures and increased border controls or closures, could limit our capacity to meet
customer demand and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of
operations.
The spread of COVID-19 has caused us to modify our business practices (including employee travel,
mandatory work-from-home policies and cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events and
conferences), and we may take further actions as required by government authorities and regulations
or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners and suppliers.
Most of our employees continue to work remotely. There is no
 18 
 Table of Contents 
certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the disease, and our
ability to perform critical functions could be harmed.
While the extent and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy and our business is
difficult to assess or predict, the pandemic has resulted in, and may continue to result in,
significant disruption of global financial markets, which may reduce our ability to access capital or
our customers’ ability to pay us for past or future purchases, which could negatively affect our
liquidity. A recession or financial market correction resulting from the lack of containment and
spread of COVID-19 could impact overall technology spending, adversely affecting demand for our
products, our business and the value of our common stock.
The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or a similar health epidemic is highly uncertain and
subject to change. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial
performance, including our ability to execute our business strategies and initiatives in the expected
time frame, will depend on future developments, including, but not limited to, the duration and
continued spread of the pandemic, its severity, the actions to contain the disease or treat its
impact, availability of vaccines or other treatments, further related restrictions on travel, and the
duration, timing and severity of the impact on customer spending, including any recession resulting
from the pandemic, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. An extended period of global
supply chain and economic disruption as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic could have a material
negative impact on our business, results of operations, access to sources of liquidity and financial
condition, though the full extent and duration is uncertain.
We may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of business acquisitions
or investments, including the Mellanox acquisition and the planned Arm acquisition, and we may not be
able to successfully integrate acquisition targets, which could hurt our ability to grow our
business, develop new products or sell our products.
We have in the past acquired and invested in, and may continue to acquire and invest in, other
businesses that offer products, services and technologies that we believe will help expand or enhance
our existing products, strategic objectives and business. We completed our acquisition of Mellanox
for approximately $7 billion in April 2020. In September 2020, we announced our agreement to acquire
all allotted and issued ordinary shares of Arm in a transaction valued at $40 billion. The Mellanox
acquisition, the planned Arm acquisition and future acquisitions or investments involve significant
challenges and risks, and could impair our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell
our products, and ultimately could have a negative impact on our growth or our financial results.
Given that our resources are limited, our decision to pursue a transaction has opportunity costs;
accordingly, if we pursue a particular transaction, we may need to forgo the prospect of entering
into other transactions that could help us achieve our strategic objectives. Furthermore, if we are
unable to complete acquisitions in a timely manner, including due to delays in obtaining regulatory
approvals, we may be unable to pursue other transactions, we may not be able to retain critical
talent from the target company, technology may evolve, making the acquisition less attractive, and
other changes can take place which could jeopardize or reduce the anticipated benefits of the
transaction and negatively impact our business. In addition, we have made and may in the future make
strategic investments in private companies and may not realize a return on our investments.
Additional risks related to the Mellanox acquisition, the planned Arm acquisition and other
acquisitions or strategic investments include, but are not limited to:
• difficulty in combining the technology, products, or operations of the acquired business with our
business;
• difficulty in integrating and retaining the acquired workforce, including key employees;
• diversion of capital and other resources, including management’s attention;
• assumption of liabilities and incurring amortization expenses, impairment charges to goodwill or
write-downs of acquired assets;
• integrating financial forecasting and controls, procedures and reporting cycles;
• coordinating and integrating operations in countries in which we have not previously operated;
• acquiring business challenges and risks, including, but not limited to, disputes with management
and integrating international operations and joint ventures;
• difficulty in realizing a satisfactory return, if any return at all;
• difficulty in obtaining or inability to obtain governmental and regulatory consents and approvals,
other approvals or financing;
 19 
 Table of Contents 
• the potential impact of with complying with governmental or other regulatory restrictions placed on
an acquisition;
• the potential impact on our stock price and financial results if we are unable to obtain regulatory
approval for an acquisition, are required to pay reverse breakup fees or are otherwise unable to
close an acquisition;
• failure and costs associated with the failure to consummate a proposed acquisition or other
strategic investment;
• legal proceedings initiated as a result of an acquisition or investment;
• the potential for our acquisitions to result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities;
• the potential variability of the amount and form of any performance-based consideration;
• uncertainties and time needed to realize the benefits of an acquisition or strategic investment, if
at all;
• negative changes in general economic conditions in the regions or the industries in which we or our
target operate;
• the need to determine an alternative strategy if an acquisition does not meet our expectations;
• potential failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant issues with the acquired
assets or company; and
• impairment of relationships with, or loss of our or our target’s employees, vendors and customers,
as a result of our acquisition or investment.
We receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers within our partner
network and our revenue could be adversely affected if we lose or are prevented from selling to any
of these customers.
We receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers within our
distribution and partner network. With several of these distributors and partners, we are selling
multiple target market platforms through their channels. Our operating results in the foreseeable
future will continue to depend on sales within our partner network, as well as the ability of these
partners to sell products that incorporate our processors. In the future, these partners may decide
to purchase fewer products than they did in the past, not to incorporate our products into their
ecosystem, or to alter their purchasing patterns in some other way, particularly because:
• most of our sales are made on a purchase order basis, which permits our customers to cancel, change
or delay product purchase commitments with little or no notice to us and without penalty;
• our partners may develop their own solutions;
• our customers may purchase products from our competitors; or
• our partners may discontinue sales or lose market share in the markets for which they purchase our
products.
We could also be restricted from selling our products or providing our technology and services due to
U.S. trade restrictions. The loss of any of our large customers, a significant reduction in purchases
by them, or our inability to sell to a customer due to U.S. trade restrictions would likely harm our
financial condition and results of operations, and any difficulties in collecting accounts receivable
could harm our operating results and financial condition.
We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of
certain of our customers to make required payments and obtain credit insurance over the purchasing
credit extended to these customers. In the future, we may have to record additional provisions or
write-offs and/or defer revenue on certain sales transactions, which could negatively impact our
financial results, and we may not be able to acquire credit insurance on the credit we extend to
these customers or in amounts that we deem sufficient.
We are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with international operations, including adverse
economic conditions, which may harm our business.
We conduct our business worldwide and we have offices in various countries outside of the United
States. Our semiconductor wafers are manufactured, assembled, tested and packaged by third parties
located outside of the United States. We also generate a significant portion of our revenue from
sales outside the United States. We allocate revenue
 20 
 Table of Contents 
to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if our
customers’ revenue is attributable to end customers that are located in a different location. Revenue
from sales outside of the United States accounted for 81% of total revenue for fiscal year 2021, 92%
for fiscal year 2020 and 87% for fiscal year 2019. Revenue from billings to China, including Hong
Kong, was 23% of our revenue for fiscal year 2021. Additionally, as of January 31, 2021,
approximately 53% of our employees were located outside of the United States. The global nature of
our business subjects us to a number of risks and uncertainties, which could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including:
• international economic and political conditions and other political tensions between countries in
which we do business;
• unexpected changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory requirements, including changes
in tax laws and employee safety and health regulations and those applicable to business acquisitions;
• differing legal standards with respect to protection of intellectual property and employment
practices;
• local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices, including
business practices that we are prohibited from engaging in by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and
other anticorruption laws and regulations;
• exporting or importing issues related to export or import restrictions, including deemed export
restrictions, tariffs, quotas and other trade barriers and restrictions;
• disruptions of capital and trading markets and currency fluctuations;
• increased costs due to imposition of climate change regulations, such as carbon taxes, fuel or
energy taxes, and pollution limits; and
• natural disasters, public health issues (including the COVID-19 pandemic discussed further in the
risk factor “The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our business and could materially adversely
affect our financial condition and results of operations,” above), and other catastrophic events.
If our sales outside of the United States are delayed or cancelled because of any of the above
factors, our revenue may be negatively impacted.
We are subject to laws and regulations worldwide that differ among jurisdictions, affecting our
operations in areas including, but not limited to: IP ownership and infringement; tax; import and
export requirements; anti-corruption; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions;
data privacy requirements; competition; advertising; employment; product regulations; environment,
health, and safety requirements; and consumer laws. Compliance with such requirements can be onerous
and expensive, and may otherwise impact our business operations negatively. Expanding privacy
legislation and compliance costs of privacy-related and data protection measures could adversely
affect our customers and their products and services, which could in turn reduce demand for our
products used for those workloads.
Although we have policies, controls, and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with
applicable laws, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, suppliers, or agents will
not violate such laws or our policies. Violations of these laws and regulations can result in fines;
criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees; prohibitions on the conduct of our
business; and damage to our reputation. The technology industry is subject to intense media,
political, and regulatory scrutiny, which can increase our exposure to government investigations,
legal actions, and penalties.
Adverse changes in global, regional or local economic conditions, including recession or slowing
growth, changes or uncertainty in fiscal, monetary, or trade policy, higher interest rates, tighter
credit, inflation, lower capital expenditures by businesses including on IT infrastructure, increases
in unemployment, and lower consumer confidence and spending, periodically occur. The COVID-19
pandemic has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty. It is likely that the continued
spread of COVID-19 will cause an economic slowdown, and it is possible that it could cause a global
recession. Adverse changes in economic conditions, including as a result of the pandemic, can
significantly harm demand for our products and make it more challenging to forecast our operating
results and make business decisions, including regarding prioritization of investments in our
business. A slowdown in economic growth could have adverse, wide-ranging effects on our business and
financial results, including a decrease in demand for our products and technologies; a decrease in
demand for the products and services of our customers or licensees; the inability of our suppliers to
deliver on their supply commitments to us, our inability to supply our products to our customers
and/or the
 21 
 Table of Contents 
inability of our customers or licensees to supply their products to end users; the insolvency of key
suppliers, customers or licensees; delays in reporting or payments from our customers or licensees;
failures by counterparties; and/or negative effects on inventories. Uncertain market conditions,
difficulties in obtaining capital, or reduced profitability may also cause some customers to scale
back operations, exit businesses, merge with other manufacturers, or file for bankruptcy protection
and potentially cease operations, which can also result in lower sales, additional inventory or bad
debt expense. Economic and industry uncertainty may similarly affect suppliers, which could impair
their ability to deliver parts and negatively affect our ability to manage operations and deliver our
products. These conditions may also lead to consolidation or strategic alliances among other
equipment manufacturers, which could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively. An economic
downturn or increased uncertainty may also lead to increased credit and collectability risks, higher
borrowing costs or reduced availability of capital markets, reduced liquidity, adverse impacts on our
suppliers, failures of counterparties including financial institutions and insurers, asset
impairments, and declines in the value of our financial instruments.
Additionally, we have engineering facilities, corporate and sales support operations and some of our
manufacturing located in Israel. Accordingly, political, economic and military conditions in Israel
and the Middle East may directly affect our business. In addition, the State of Israel and companies
with business in Israel have in the past been the subject of an economic boycott and could be in the
future. Other countries have in the past, and may continue in the future, to restrict business with
the State of Israel and companies with Israeli operations. Further, we are unable to ship products
manufactured in Israel to certain countries. These laws and policies may have an impact on our
results of operations. Any losses or damages incurred by us as a result of such events could have an
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
If we are unable to attract, retain and motivate our executives and key employees, we may not be able
to execute our business strategy effectively.
To be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully, we must attract, retain and
motivate our executives and key employees. The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our
industry is extremely competitive. In particular, hiring qualified executives, scientists, engineers,
technical staff and research and development personnel is critical to our business. We also must
recruit and develop diverse talent. Additionally, changes in immigration and work permit laws and
regulations or the administration or interpretation of such laws or regulations could impair our
ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees. If we are less successful in our recruiting
efforts, or if we cannot retain key employees, our ability to develop and deliver successful products
and services may be adversely affected. Additionally, competition for personnel results in increased
costs in the form of cash and stock-based compensation. The interpretation and application of
employment related laws to our workforce practices may result in increased operating costs and less
flexibility in how we meet our workforce needs. We also must retain the key personnel hired as a
result of our acquisitions, or it could reduce the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions and
negatively impact our business. Effective succession planning is also important to our long-term
success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key
employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution. We continue to evolve our business
practices in response to the COVID-19 pandemic by supporting and providing resources to our employees
who are working remotely and implementing stringent safety guidelines for those who go into the
essential labs and offices that remain open. If we do not continue to anticipate and address the
safety and wellness needs of our employees sufficiently and/or in a timely manner, their productivity
could be impacted, or we could fail to retain them.
Our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate, and if our
operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price
could decline.
Our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future continue to fluctuate due to
numerous factors. Therefore, investors should not rely on quarterly comparisons of our results of
operations as an indication of our future performance.
Additional factors, other than or in addition to those described elsewhere in these risk factors,
that could affect our results of operations in the future include, but are not limited to:
• our ability to achieve volume production of our next-generation products;
• our inability to adjust spending to offset revenue shortfalls due to the multi-year development
cycle for some of our products and services;
• fluctuations in the demand for our products related to cryptocurrencies and COVID-19, as discussed
further in the risk factor “If we fail to estimate customer demand properly, our financial results
could be harmed;”
 22 
 Table of Contents 
• changes in the timing of product orders due to unexpected delays in the introduction of our
partners’ products;
• our ability to cover the manufacturing and design costs of our products through competitive
pricing;
• our ability to comply and continue to comply with our customers’ contractual obligations;
• product rates of return in excess of that forecasted or expected due to quality issues;
• our ability to secure appropriate safety certifications and meet industry safety standards;
• supply constraints for and changes in the cost of the other components incorporated into our
products;
• inventory write-downs;
• our ability to continue generating revenue from our partner network, including by generating sales
within our partner network and ensuring our products are incorporated into our partners product
ecosystems, and our partner network’s ability to sell products that incorporate our technologies;
• our dependence on third party vendors and end users to adopt our products, including InfiniBand;
• the inability of certain of our customers to make required payments to us, and our ability to
obtain credit insurance over the purchasing credit extended to these customers;
• customer bad debt write-offs;
• any unanticipated costs associated with environmental liabilities;
• unexpected costs related to our ownership of real property;
• our ability to maintain and scale our business processes, information systems and internal
controls;
• changes in financial accounting standards or interpretations of existing standards; and
• general macroeconomic or industry events and factors affecting the overall market and our target
markets.
Any one or more of the factors discussed above could prevent us from achieving our expected future
financial results. Any such failure to meet our expectations or the expectations of our investors or
security analysts could cause our stock price to decline or experience substantial price volatility.
Risks Related to Regulatory, Legal, Our Common Stock and Other Matters
Actions to adequately protect our IP rights could result in substantial costs to us and our ability
to compete could be harmed if we are unsuccessful in doing so or if we are prohibited from making or
selling our products.
We have in the past, currently are, and may in the future become involved in lawsuits or other legal
proceedings alleging patent infringement or other intellectual property rights violations by us, our
employees or parties that we have agreed to indemnify for certain claims of infringement. An
unfavorable ruling in any such intellectual property related litigation could include significant
damages, invalidation of a patent or family of patents, indemnification of customers, payment of lost
profits, or, when it has been sought, injunctive relief. Claims that our products or processes
infringe the IP rights of others, regardless of their merit, could cause us to incur significant
costs to respond to, defend, and resolve such claims, and they may also divert the efforts and
attention of management and technical personnel.
We may commence litigation or other legal proceedings in order to protect our intellectual property
rights. Such proceedings may increase our operating expenses, which could negatively impact our
operating results. Further, we could be subject to countersuits as a result of our initiation of
litigation. If infringement claims are made against us or our products are found to infringe a third
party’s patent or intellectual property, we or one of our indemnitees may have to seek a license to
the third party’s patent or other intellectual property rights. However, we may not be able to obtain
licenses at all or on terms acceptable to us particularly from our competitors. If we or one of our
indemnitees is unable to obtain a license from a third party for technology that we use or that is
used in one of our products, we could be subject to substantial liabilities or have to suspend or
discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of our products. We may also have to make royalty
or other payments, or cross license our technology. If these arrangements are not concluded on
commercially reasonable terms, our business could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, the
indemnification of a customer or other indemnitee may increase our operating expenses which could
negatively impact our operating results.
 23 
 Table of Contents 
Our success depends in part on protecting our intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely
primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party
nondisclosure agreements, licensing arrangements, and the laws of the countries in which we operate
to protect our intellectual property in the United States and internationally. We may be required to
spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights, and even with
significant expenditures we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights that are
valuable to our business. The laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our products or
intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. This makes the
possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely. In addition, the theft or
unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information
could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products; as a result, the value of
our investment in research and development, product development, and marketing could be reduced. We
also may face risks to our intellectual property if our employees are hired by potential competitors.
We continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for existing and new innovations
and technologies, but cannot be certain whether our applications for such protections will be
approved, and, if approved, whether we will be able to enforce such protections.
Privacy concerns relating to our products and services could damage our reputation, deter current and
potential users from using our products and services, result in liability, or result in legal or
regulatory proceedings.
Our products and services may provide us with access to sensitive, confidential or personal data or
information that is subject to privacy and security laws and regulations. Concerns about our
practices or the ultimate use of our products and services with regard to the collection, use,
retention, security or disclosure of personal information or other privacy-related matters, including
for use in AI, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation and adversely affect our operating
results. The theft, loss, or misuse of personal data collected, used, stored, or transferred by us to
run our business or by one of our partners could result in significantly increased security costs,
damage to our reputation, regulatory proceedings, disruption of our business activities or increased
costs related to defending legal claims.
Worldwide regulatory authorities are considering and have approved various legislative proposals
concerning data protection, which continue to evolve and apply to our business. For example, the
European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which required companies to
meet requirements effective as of May 2018 regarding the handling of personal data, including its
use, protection and the ability of persons whose data is stored to access, correct and delete such
data about themselves. Failure to meet GDPR requirements could result in penalties of up to 4% of
worldwide revenue. In addition, California adopted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, or
CCPA, which took effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA gives California residents the right to access,
delete and opt-out of certain sharing of their personal information, and to receive detailed
information about how it is used and shared. Violations of the CCPA carry substantial civil penalties
and the law creates a private right of action for certain data breaches, which is expected to
increase data breach litigation. California’s privacy laws will expand substantially effective
January 1, 2023 as a result of California voters approving the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020,
or CPRA, in the November 2020 election. The CPRA will, among other things, restrict use of certain
categories of sensitive personal information; further restrict the use of cross-contextual
advertising techniques; establish restrictions on the retention of personal information; expand the
types of data breaches subject to the private right of action; and establish the California Privacy
Protection Agency to implement and enforce the new law, as well as impose administrative fines. Since
the enactment of the CCPA, more than half of the states in the United States and the United States
Congress have considered proposed privacy legislation, reflecting a trend toward more stringent
privacy legislation in the United States.
The interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the United States, Europe
and elsewhere are often uncertain and fluid, and may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is
inconsistent with our data practices. If so, we may be ordered to change our data practices and/or be
fined. Complying with these changing laws has caused, and could continue to cause, us to incur
substantial costs, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
Further, failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders
to stop the alleged noncompliant activity.
We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities and our operating results may be adversely
impacted by higher than expected tax rates.
As a multinational corporation, we are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes,
such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, net worth, property and goods and services taxes, in both
the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. Our domestic and international tax liabilities
are subject to the allocation of revenue and expenses in different jurisdictions. Significant
judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax
liabilities. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions. For example,
we are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for our fiscal years 2018 and 2019
and under audit in the United Kingdom, Germany, Israel and India. Although we believe our tax
estimates are reasonable, tax authorities may
 24 
 Table of Contents 
disagree with certain positions we have taken, and any adverse outcome of such a review or audit
could increase our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount of non-income taxes imposed on
our business, and harm our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Further,
changes in United States federal, and state or international tax laws applicable to multinational
corporations or other fundamental law changes may materially impact our tax expense and cash flows,
as we experienced in fiscal year 2018 with the passage of the TCJA.
Our future effective tax rate may be affected by such factors as changes in tax laws, changes in our
business or statutory rates, changes in jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be
earned and taxed, changes in available tax credits, the resolution of issues arising from tax audits,
changes in United States generally accepted accounting principles, adjustments to income taxes upon
finalization of tax returns, increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, changes in the
valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and in deferred tax valuation allowances,
changing interpretation of existing laws or regulations, the impact of accounting for stock-based
compensation and the recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies within the income tax
provision in the period in which they occur, the impact of accounting for business combinations,
shifts in the amount of earnings in the United States compared with other regions in the world and
overall levels of income before tax, changes in the domestic or international organization of our
business and structure, as well as the expiration of statute of limitations and settlements of
audits. Any changes in our effective tax rate may reduce our net income.
Our business is exposed to the risks associated with litigation, investigations and regulatory
proceedings.
We currently and may in the future face legal, administrative and regulatory proceedings, claims,
demands and/or investigations involving shareholder, consumer, competition and/or other issues
relating to our business on a global basis. For example, we are currently defending ourselves in a
shareholder lawsuit claiming that we and certain of our officers made false and/or misleading
statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand in 2017
and 2018. In addition, multiple stockholders, purporting to act on our behalf, filed derivative
lawsuits seeking to assert claims on our behalf against the members of our board of directors and
certain officers based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to
channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand.
Litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse rulings could occur,
including monetary damages, or an injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain
products, engaging in certain business practices, or requiring other remedies, such as compulsory
licensing of patents. An unfavorable outcome or settlement may result in a material adverse impact on
our business, results of operations, financial position, and overall trends. In addition, regardless
of the outcome, litigation can be costly, time-consuming, and disruptive to our operations.
In addition, the laws and regulations our business is subject to are complex and change frequently.
We may be required to incur significant expense to comply with changes in, or remedy violations of,
these laws and regulations.
Delaware law and provisions in our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and our agreement with
Microsoft Corporation could delay or prevent a change in control.
Our status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General
Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging
in a business combination with an interested shareholder for a period of three years after the person
becomes an interested shareholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing
shareholders. In addition, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could
make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock. These
provisions include the following:
• the ability of our Board of Directors to create and issue preferred stock without prior shareholder
approval;
• the prohibition of shareholder action by written consent;
• advance notice requirements for director nominations and shareholder proposals;
• the ability of our Board of Directors to increase or decrease the number of directors without
shareholder approval;
• a super-majority voting requirement to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation
and bylaws;
• the inability of our shareholders to call special meetings of shareholders; and
• the ability of our Board of Directors to make, amend or repeal our bylaws.

On March 5, 2000, we entered into an agreement with Microsoft in which we agreed to develop and sell
graphics chips and to license certain technology to Microsoft and its licensees for use in the Xbox.
Under the agreement, if an individual or corporation makes an offer to purchase shares equal to or
greater than 30% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, Microsoft may have first and last
rights of refusal to purchase the stock. The Microsoft provision and the other factors listed above
could also delay or prevent a change in control of NVIDIA. These provisions could also discourage
proxy contests and make it more difficult for shareholders to elect directors of their choosing and
to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire.
Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from implementing our
strategy or fulfilling our contractual obligations.
In March 2020, we issued $1.50 billion of the 2.85% Notes Due 2030, $1.00 billion of the 3.50% Notes
Due 2040, $2.00 billion of the 3.50% Notes Due 2050, and $500 million of the 3.70% Notes Due 2060, or
collectively, the March 2020 Notes. In September 2016, we issued $1.00 billion of the 2.20% Notes Due
2021 and $1.00 billion of the 3.20% Notes Due 2026, or collectively, the September 2016 Notes.
Our indebtedness may limit our ability to use our cash flow or borrow additional funds for working
capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate and other purposes. Additionally,
our obligation to make payments related to the Notes could impact our cash balance and limit our
ability to use our cash for our capital return program and our other liquidity needs, including
working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments and other general corporate
purposes.

Our headquarters complex is located in Santa Clara, California. It includes ten leased commercial
buildings totaling 1,019,887 square feet, and real property that we own totaling 720,046 square feet.
Our owned property consists of two commercial buildings and a building under construction. The
construction is targeted for completion in fiscal year 2023. In addition, we also lease data center
space in Santa Clara, California.
Outside of Santa Clara, California, we lease facilities in a number of regional facilities in other
U.S. locations that are used as research and development centers and/or sales and administrative
offices. Outside of the United States, we own a building in Hyderabad, India, that is being used
primarily as a research and development center. We also lease facilities in various international
locations that are used as research and development centers and/or sales and administrative offices.
These leased facilities are located primarily in Asia, Europe, and Israel. In addition, we also lease
data center space in various locations around the world.
We believe that we currently have sufficient facilities to conduct our operations for the next twelve
months. We do not identify or allocate assets by operating segment. For additional information
regarding obligations under leases, refer to Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
