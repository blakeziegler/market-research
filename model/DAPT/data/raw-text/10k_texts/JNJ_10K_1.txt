Cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements
This Annual Report on Form 10-K and Johnson & Johnson’s other publicly available documents contain
“forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the United States
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Management and representatives of Johnson & Johnson
and its subsidiaries (the Company) also may from time to time make forward-looking statements.
Forward-looking statements do not relate strictly to historical or current facts and reflect
management’s assumptions, views, plans, objectives and projections about the future. Forward-looking
statements may be identified by the use of words such as “plans,” “expects,” “will,” “anticipates,”
“estimates” and other words of similar meaning in conjunction with, among other things: discussions
of future operations; expected operating results and financial performance; impact of planned
acquisitions and dispositions; impact and timing of restructuring initiatives, including associated
cost savings and other benefits; the Company’s strategy for growth; product development activities;
regulatory approvals; market position and expenditures.
Because forward-looking statements are based on current beliefs, expectations and assumptions
regarding future events, they are subject to uncertainties, risks and changes that are difficult to
predict and many of which are outside of the Company’s control. Investors should realize that if
underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, or known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, the
Company’s actual results and financial condition could vary materially from expectations and
projections expressed or implied in its forward-looking statements. Investors are therefore cautioned
not to rely on these forward-looking statements. Risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited
to:
Risks related to product development, market success and competition
• Challenges and uncertainties inherent in innovation and development of new and improved products
and technologies on which the Company’s continued growth and success depend, including uncertainty of
clinical outcomes, additional analysis of existing clinical data, obtaining regulatory approvals,
health plan coverage and customer access, and initial and continued commercial success;
• Challenges to the Company’s ability to secure and maintain adequate patent and other intellectual
property rights for new and existing products and technologies in the United States and other
important markets;
• The impact of patent expirations, typically followed by the introduction of competing generic,
biosimilar or other products and resulting revenue and market share losses;
• Increasingly aggressive and frequent challenges to the Company’s patents by competitors and others
seeking to launch competing generic, biosimilar or other products and increased receptivity of
courts, the United States Patent and Trademark Office and other decision makers to such challenges,
potentially resulting in loss of market exclusivity and rapid decline in sales for the relevant
product sooner than expected;
• Competition in research and development of new and improved products, processes and technologies,
which can result in product and process obsolescence;
• Competition to reach agreement with third parties for collaboration, licensing, development and
marketing agreements for products and technologies;
• Competition based on cost-effectiveness, product performance, technological advances and patents
attained by competitors; and
• Allegations that the Company’s products infringe the patents and other intellectual property rights
of third parties, which could adversely affect the Company’s ability to sell the products in question
and require the payment of money damages and future royalties.
Risks related to product liability, litigation and regulatory activity
• Product efficacy or safety concerns, whether or not based on scientific evidence, potentially
resulting in product withdrawals, recalls, regulatory action on the part of the United States Food
and Drug Administration (U.S. FDA) (or international counterparts), declining sales, reputational
damage, increased litigation expense and share price impact;
• The impact, including declining sales and reputational damage, of significant litigation or
government action adverse to the Company, including product liability claims and allegations related
to pharmaceutical marketing practices and contracting strategies;
• The impact of an adverse judgment or settlement and the adequacy of reserves related to legal
proceedings, including patent litigation, product liability, personal injury claims, securities class
actions, government investigations, employment and other legal proceedings;
• Increased scrutiny of the healthcare industry by government agencies and state attorneys general
resulting in investigations and prosecutions, which carry the risk of significant civil and criminal
penalties, including, but not limited to, debarment from government business;
• Failure to meet compliance obligations in compliance agreements with governments or government
agencies, which could result in significant sanctions;
• Potential changes to applicable laws and regulations affecting United States and international
operations, including relating to: approval of new products; licensing and patent rights; sales and
promotion of healthcare products; access to, and reimbursement and pricing for, healthcare products
and services; environmental protection; and sourcing of raw materials;
• Compliance with local regulations and laws that may restrict the Company’s ability to manufacture
or sell its products in relevant markets, including requirements to comply with medical device
reporting regulations and other requirements such as the European Union’s Medical Devices Regulation;
• Changes in domestic and international tax laws and regulations, increasing audit scrutiny by tax
authorities around the world may cause exposures to additional tax liabilities potentially in excess
of existing reserves; and
• The issuance of new or revised accounting standards by the Financial Accounting Standards Board and
regulations by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Risks related to the Company’s strategic initiatives and healthcare market trends
• Pricing pressures resulting from trends toward healthcare cost containment, including the continued
consolidation among healthcare providers and other market participants, trends toward managed care,
the shift toward governments increasingly becoming the primary payors of healthcare expenses,
significant new entrants to the healthcare markets seeking to reduce costs and government pressure on
companies to voluntarily reduce costs and price increases;
• Restricted spending patterns of individual, institutional and governmental purchasers of healthcare
products and services due to economic hardship and budgetary constraints;
• Challenges to the Company’s ability to realize its strategy for growth including through externally
sourced innovations, such as development collaborations, strategic acquisitions, licensing and
marketing agreements, and the potential heightened costs of any such external arrangements due to
competitive pressures;
• The potential that the expected strategic benefits and opportunities from any planned or completed
acquisition or divestiture by the Company, including the divestment of Kenvue Inc., may not be
realized or may take longer to realize than expected; and
• The potential that the expected benefits and opportunities related to past and ongoing
restructuring actions may not be realized or may take longer to realize than expected.
Risks related to economic conditions, financial markets and operating internationally
• The risks associated with global operations on the Company and its customers and suppliers,
including foreign governments in countries in which the Company operates;
• The impact of inflation and fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates and the
potential effect of such fluctuations on revenues, expenses and resulting margins;
• Potential changes in export/import and trade laws, regulations and policies of the United States
and other countries, including any increased trade restrictions or tariffs and potential drug
reimportation legislation, and the impact of such changes on raw material prices, supply chains
market volatility and the pace of product development;
• The impact on international operations from financial instability in international economies,
sovereign risk, possible imposition of governmental controls and restrictive economic policies, and
unstable international governments and legal systems;
• The impact of global public health crises and pandemics;
• Changes to global climate, extreme weather and natural disasters that could affect demand for the
Company’s products and services, cause disruptions in manufacturing and distribution networks, alter
the availability of goods and services within the supply chain, and affect the overall design and
integrity of the Company’s products and operations;
• The impact of global or economic changes or events, including global tensions and war; and
• The impact of armed conflicts and terrorist attacks in the United States and other parts of the
world, including social and economic disruptions and instability of financial and other markets.
 Risks related to supply chain and operations 
• Difficulties and delays in manufacturing, internally, through third-party providers or otherwise
within the supply chain, that may lead to voluntary or involuntary business interruptions or
shutdowns, product shortages, withdrawals or suspensions of products from the market, and potential
regulatory action;
• Interruptions and breaches of the Company’s information technology systems or those of the
Company’s vendors, which could result in reputational, competitive, operational or other business
harm as well as financial costs and regulatory action;
• Reliance on global supply chains and production and distribution processes that are complex and
subject to increasing regulatory requirements that may adversely affect supply, sourcing and pricing
of materials used in the Company’s products; and
• The potential that the expected benefits and opportunities related to restructuring actions may not
be realized or may take longer to realize than expected, including due to any required approvals from
applicable regulatory authorities.
Investors also should carefully read the risk factors described in Item 1A of this Annual Report on
Form 10-K for a description of certain risks that could, among other things, cause the Company’s
actual results to differ materially from those expressed in its forward-looking statements. Investors
should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and should not
consider the risks described above and in Item 1A to be a complete statement of all potential risks
and uncertainties. The Company does not undertake to publicly update any forward-looking statement
that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information or future events or
developments.

│ Item 1. Business │
 General 
Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) have approximately 138,100 employees worldwide
engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the
healthcare field. Johnson & Johnson is a holding company, with operating companies conducting
business in virtually all countries of the world. The Company’s primary focus is products related to
human health and well-being. Johnson & Johnson was incorporated in the State of New Jersey in 1887.
The Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) is the Company's Chief Executive Officer (Principal
Executive Officer). The Executive Committee is Johnson & Johnson’s senior leadership team responsible
for setting the strategy and priorities of the Company and driving accountability at all levels.
Within the strategic parameters provided by the Executive Committee, senior management groups at U.S.
and international operating companies are each responsible for their own strategic plans and the day-
to-day operations of those companies.
 Segments of business 
The Company is organized into two business segments: Innovative Medicine and MedTech. Additional
information required by this item is incorporated herein by reference to the narrative and tabular
descriptions of segments and operating results under: Item 7. Management’s discussion and analysis of
results of operations and financial condition of this Report; and Note 17 Segments of business and
geographic areas of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report.

multiple
 2024 Annual Report1 
myeloma; ZYTIGA (abiraterone acetate), a treatment for patients with prostate cancer; ERLEADA
(apalutamide), a next-generation androgen receptor inhibitor for the treatment of patients with
prostate cancer; IMBRUVICA (ibrutinib), a treatment for certain B-cell malignancies, or blood cancers
and chronic graft versus host disease; DARZALEX (daratumumab), a treatment for multiple myeloma;
DARZALEX FASPRO (daratumumab and hyaluronidase-fihj), a treatment for multiple myeloma and light
chain (AL) Amyloidosis; TECVAYLI (teclistamab-cqyv), a ready-to-use bispecific antibody for adults
with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least four prior lines of therapy;
XARELTO (rivaroxaban), an oral anticoagulant for the prevention of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which
may lead to pulmonary embolism (PE) in patients undergoing hip or knee replacement surgery, to reduce
the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, and for
the treatment and reduction of risk of recurrence of DVT and PE to reduce the risk of major
cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and peripheral artery disease
(PAD), for the treatment and secondary prevention of thromboembolism in pediatric patients, and for
thromboprophylaxis in pediatric patients following the Fontan procedure; OPSUMIT (macitentan) as
monotherapy or in combination, indicated for the long-term treatment of pulmonary arterial
hypertension (PAH); UPTRAVI (selexipag), the only approved oral and intravenous, selective IP
receptor agonist targeting a prostacyclin pathway in PAH. Many of these medicines were developed in
collaboration with strategic partners or are licensed from other companies and maintain active
lifecycle development programs.
 MedTech 
The MedTech segment includes a broad portfolio of products used in the cardiovascular, orthopaedics,
surgery, and vision categories. The Cardiovascular (previously referred to as Interventional
solutions) portfolio includes electrophysiology products to treat heart rhythm disorders, the heart
recovery portfolio (Abiomed) which includes technologies to treat severe coronary artery disease
requiring high-risk PCI or AMI cardiogenic shock, circulatory restoration products (Shockwave) for
the treatment of calcified coronary artery disease (CAD) and peripheral artery disease (PAD), and
neurovascular care that treats hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke. The Orthopaedics portfolio includes
products and enabling technologies that support hips, knees, trauma, spine, sports, and others. The
Surgery portfolios include advanced and general surgery technologies, as well as solutions that focus
on breast aesthetics and reconstruction (Mentor). Vision products include ACUVUE brand contact lenses
and TECNIS intraocular lenses for cataract surgery. These products are distributed to wholesalers,
hospitals, and retailers and are used predominantly in the professional fields by physicians, nurses,
hospitals, eye care professionals, and clinics.
 Geographic areas 
The Company conducts business in virtually all countries of the world with the primary focus on
products related to human health and well-being. The products made and sold in the international
business include many of those described above under Segments of Business – Innovative Medicine and
MedTech. However, the principal markets, products and methods of distribution in the international
business vary with the country and the culture. The products sold in the international business
include those developed in the U.S. and by subsidiaries abroad.
Investments and activities in some countries outside the U.S. are subject to higher risks than
comparable U.S. activities because the investment and commercial climate may be influenced by
financial instability in international economies, restrictive economic policies and political and
legal system uncertainties.
 Raw materials 
Raw materials essential to the Company's business are generally readily available from multiple
sources. Where there are exceptions, the temporary unavailability of those raw materials would not
likely have a material adverse effect on the financial results of the Company.
 Patents 
The Company's subsidiaries have made a practice of obtaining patent protection on their products and
processes where possible. They own, or are licensed under, a significant number of patents in the
U.S. and other countries relating to their products, product uses, formulations and manufacturing
processes, which in the aggregate are believed to be of material importance to the Company in the
operation of its businesses. The Company’s subsidiaries face patent challenges from third parties,
including challenges seeking to manufacture and market generic and biosimilar versions of the
Company's key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those
products. Significant legal proceedings
 2 
and claims involving the Company's patent and other intellectual property are described in Note 19
Legal proceedings—Intellectual property of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in
Item 8 of this Report.
Sales of the Company’s largest product, collectively DARZALEX (daratumumab) and DARZALEX FASPRO
(daratumumab and hyaluronidase-fihj), accounted for approximately 13.1% of the Company's total
revenues for fiscal 2024. Accordingly, the patents related to these products are believed to be
material to the Company. Genmab A/S owns two patent families related to DARZALEX, and Janssen
Biotech, Inc. has an exclusive license to those patent families. The two patent families both expire
in the United States in 2029, and in Europe, compound/use patent protection in select countries
extends to 2031/2032. Janssen Biotech, Inc. owns a separate patent portfolio related to DARZALEX
FASPRO.
Sales of the Company’s second largest product, STELARA (ustekinumab) accounted for approximately
11.7% of the Company's total revenues for fiscal 2024. According to patent settlement and license
agreements, the Company expects continued launches of biosimilar versions of STELARA in Europe and
the United States in 2025 which will impact the Company’s sales of STELARA.
 Trademarks 
The Company’s subsidiaries have made a practice of selling their products under trademarks and of
obtaining protection for these trademarks by all available means. These trademarks are protected by
registration in the U.S. and other countries where such products are marketed. The Company considers
these trademarks in the aggregate to be of material importance in the operation of its businesses.
 Seasonality 
Worldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality; however, spending has typically
been heavier in the fourth quarter of each year than in other quarters. This reflects increased
spending decisions, principally for advertising and research and development activity.
 Competition 
In all of their product lines, the Company's subsidiaries compete with companies both locally and
globally. Competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the
competing companies involved. Competition in research, both internally and externally sourced,
involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes, is
particularly significant. The development of new and innovative products, as well as protecting the
underlying intellectual property of the Company’s product portfolio, is important to the Company's
success in all areas of its business. The competitive environment requires substantial investments in
continuing research.
 Environment 
The Company is subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations in the United States and
other jurisdictions. The Company believes that its operations comply in all material respects with
applicable environmental laws and regulations. The Company’s compliance with these requirements is
not expected to have a material effect upon its capital expenditures, cash flows, earnings or
competitive position.
 Regulation 
The Company’s businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries
in which operations are conducted, and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation
and enforcement. The Company is subject to costly and complex U.S. and foreign laws and governmental
regulations, and any adverse regulatory action may materially adversely affect the Company's
financial condition and business operations. In the U.S., the pharmaceutical product and medical
technology industries have long been subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies,
primarily as to product safety, efficacy, manufacturing, advertising, labeling and safety reporting.
The exercise of broad regulatory powers by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the U.S. FDA)
continues to result in increases in the amounts of testing and documentation required for U.S. FDA
approval of new drugs and devices and a corresponding increase in the expense of product
introduction. Similar trends are also evident in major markets outside of the U.S.
 2024 Annual Report3 
The medical device regulatory framework and the evolving privacy, data localization, and emerging
cyber security laws and regulations around the world are examples of such increased regulation.
Within the U.S., an increasing number of U.S. States have enacted comprehensive privacy laws, and
federal regulators (e.g., the U.S. FDA, FTC and HHS) continue to stress the intersection of health
and privacy as a compliance and enforcement priority. In the EU, multiple directives and laws
(including NIS2, EHDS, the Data Act, the Cyber Resilience Act, and the AI Act) are rapidly changing
privacy and cybersecurity compliance requirements while introducing new enforcement risks. In
addition, China has introduced broad personal information protection and data security regulations,
with more anticipated, thereby increasing China’s scrutiny of company compliance and data transfer
practices. With other jurisdictions enacting similar privacy laws, local data protection authorities
will force greater accountability on the collection, access and use of personal data in the
healthcare industry. These laws can also restrict transfers of data across borders, potentially
impacting how data-driven health care solutions are developed and deployed globally in a compliant
manner. Moreover, as a result of the broad scale release and availability of Artificial Intelligence
(AI) technologies such as generative AI, a global trend towards more comprehensive and nuanced
regulation to ensure the ethical use, privacy, and security of AI is underway that includes standards
for transparency, accountability, and fairness, which will require compliance developments or
enhancements.
The regulatory agencies under whose purview the Company operates have administrative powers that may
subject it to actions such as product withdrawals, recalls, seizure of products and other civil and
criminal sanctions. In some cases, the Company’s subsidiaries may deem it advisable to initiate
product recalls regardless of whether it has been required or directed to.
The U.S. FDA and regulatory agencies around the globe are also increasing their enforcement
activities. If the U.S. FDA were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or
regulations, or that any of our pharmaceutical products or medical technologies are ineffective or
pose an unreasonable safety risk, the U.S. FDA could ban such products, detain or seize adulterated
or misbranded products, order a recall, repair, replacement, or refund of such products, withdraw
approval for such products, refuse to grant pending applications for marketing authorization or
require certificates of foreign governments for exports, and/or require us to notify health
professionals and others that the products present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the
public health. The U.S. FDA may also assess civil or criminal penalties against us, our officers or
employees and impose operating restrictions on a company-wide basis, or enjoin and/or restrain
certain conduct resulting in violations of applicable law. The U.S. FDA may also recommend
prosecution to the U.S. Department of Justice. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its
magnitude, may restrict us from effectively marketing and selling our products and limit our ability
to obtain future clearances, classifications or approvals, and could result in a substantial
modification to our business practices and operations. Equivalent enforcement mechanisms exist in
different countries in which we conduct business.
The costs of human healthcare have been and continue to be a subject of study, investigation and
regulation by governmental agencies and legislative bodies around the world. In the U.S., attention
has been focused by states, regulatory agencies and Congress on prices, profits, overutilization and
the quality and costs of healthcare generally. Laws and regulations have been enacted to require
adherence to strict compliance standards and prevent fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry.
There is increased focus on interactions and financial relationships between healthcare companies and
healthcare providers. Various state and federal transparency laws and regulations require disclosures
of payments and other transfers of value made to certain healthcare practitioners, including
physicians, teaching hospitals, and certain non-physician practitioners. Federal and foreign laws
governing international business practices require strict compliance with anti-bribery standards and
certain prohibitions with respect to payments to any foreign government official. Payors and Pharmacy
Benefit Managers (PBMs) are a potent force in the marketplace, and increased attention is being paid
to the impact of PBM practices on healthcare cost and access in the U.S.
Our business has been and continues to be affected by federal and state legislation that alters the
pricing, coverage, and reimbursement landscape. At the federal level, in August 2022, President Biden
signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which includes provisions that effectively
authorize the government to establish prices for certain high-spend single-source drugs and biologics
reimbursed by the Medicare program, starting in 2026 for Medicare Part D drugs and 2028 for Medicare
Part B drugs. On August 29, 2023, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) published the
first “Selected Drug” list, which includes XARELTO and STELARA as well as IMBRUVICA, which is
developed in collaboration and co-commercialized in the U.S. with Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie
company. The Selected Drug list also included other medicines targeting disease states that are
prevalent in the Medicare population. Although CMS published an explanation for how it determined
prices for selected drugs in December 2024, uncertainty remains as to the methodology used to
determine these prices. The IRA specifies a ceiling price but not a minimum price for selected drugs
and does not require CMS to use a specific framework for determining selected drug prices. In any
event, we anticipate that the selected products will be subjected to a government-established price
for the Medicare population beginning in 2026.
 4 
The IRA also contains provisions that impose rebates if certain prices increase at a rate that
outpaces the rate of inflation, beginning October 1, 2022, for Medicare Part D drugs and January 1,
2023, for Medicare Part B drugs. Separate IRA provisions redesign the Medicare Part D benefit in
various ways, including by shifting a greater portion of costs to manufacturers within certain
coverage phases and replacing the Part D coverage gap discount program with a new manufacturer
discounting program. Failure to comply with IRA provisions may subject manufacturers to various
penalties, including civil monetary penalties.
In July 2023, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Janssen) filed litigation against the U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services as well as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services challenging the
constitutionality of the IRA's Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program. The litigation requests a
declaration that the IRA violates Janssen’s rights under the First Amendment and the Fifth Amendment
to the Constitution and therefore that Janssen is not subject to the IRA’s mandatory pricing scheme.
The impact of the IRA on our business and the broader pharmaceutical industry remains uncertain, as
litigation filed by Janssen and other pharmaceutical companies remains ongoing and while CMS has
publicly announced the maximum fair price for each of the selected drugs, implementation of the
program is still in progress. In April 2024, Janssen appealed the district court’s denial of its
summary judgment motion to the Third Circuit.
Additionally, we expect continued scrutiny on drug pricing and government price reporting from
Congress, agencies, and other bodies at the federal and state levels, which may result in additional
regulations or other mechanisms to increase pricing transparency and controls.
There are a number of additional bills pending in Congress and healthcare reform proposals at the
state level that would affect drug pricing, including in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This
changing legal landscape has both positive and negative impacts on the U.S. healthcare industry with
much remaining uncertain as to how various provisions of federal and state law, and potential
modification or repeal of these laws, will ultimately affect the industry. The IRA and any other
federal or state legislative change could affect the pricing and market conditions for our products.
In addition, business practices in the healthcare industry have come under increased scrutiny,
particularly in the U.S., by government agencies and state attorneys general, and resulting
investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties. Of note
is the increased enforcement activity by data protection authorities in various jurisdictions,
particularly in the European Union, where significant fines have been levied on companies for data
breaches, violations of privacy requirements, and unlawful cross-border data transfers. In the U.S.,
the Federal Trade Commission has stepped up enforcement of data privacy with several significant
settlements (including settlements concerning the downstream sharing of personal information and use
and disclosure of personal health data) and there have been a material increase in class-action
lawsuits linked to the collection and use of biometric data and use of tracking technologies.
Further, the Company relies on global supply chains, and production and distribution processes, that
are complex, and subject to increasing regulatory requirements that may affect sourcing, supply and
pricing of materials used in the Company's products. These processes also are subject to complex and
lengthy regulatory approvals.

 Strategy 
The Company believes that its employees are critical to its continued success and are an essential
element of its long-term strategy. Management is responsible for ensuring that its policies and
processes reflect and reinforce the Company's desired corporate culture, including policies and
processes related to strategy, risk management, and ethics and compliance. The Company’s human
capital management strategy is built on three fundamental focus areas:
 • 
 Attracting and recruiting top talent 
 • 
 Developing and retaining top talent 
 • 
 Empowering and inspiring talent 
Underpinning these focus areas are ongoing efforts to cultivate and foster a culture built on
innovation, health, well-being and safety, inclusion and belonging where the Company's employees are
encouraged to succeed both professionally and personally while helping the Company achieve its
business goals.
 Culture and employee engagement 
At Johnson & Johnson, employees are guided by Our Credo, which sets forth the Company's
responsibilities to patients, consumers, customers, healthcare professionals, employees, communities
and shareholders. Employees worldwide must adhere to the Company’s Code of Business Conduct, which
sets fundamental requirements and serves as a foundation for the Company policies, procedures and
guidelines, all of which provide additional guidance on expected employee behaviors in every market
where it operates. The Company conducts global surveys that offer its employees the ability to
provide feedback and valuable insight to help address potential human resources risks and identify
opportunities to improve. In 2024, 94% of global employees across 73 countries participated in Our
Credo Survey which was offered in 36 languages.
 6 
 Growth and development 
To lead in the changing healthcare landscape, it is crucial that the Company continue to attract and
retain top talent. In 2024, the Company's voluntary turnover rate was 6.3%. The Company believes that
its employees must be equipped with the right knowledge and skills and be provided with opportunities
to grow and develop in their careers. Accordingly, professional development programs and educational
resources are available to all employees. The Company's objective is to foster a learning culture
that helps shape each person’s unique career path while creating a robust pipeline of talent to
deliver on the Company’s long-term strategies. In furtherance of this objective, the Company deploys
a global approach to ensure development is for everyone, regardless of where they are on their career
journey. To prioritize learning, the Company recently held Johnson & Johnson's second Global Learning
Day. Employees were encouraged to set aside a full day to explore skill-building courses on J&J
Learn, the new state-of-the-art learning platform.
 Our workforce 
As stated in Our Credo, we are responsible to our employees who work with us throughout the world.
The Company is committed to cultivating, fostering and advancing an inclusive, credo-based work
environment for employees that recognizes and rewards based on merit. The Company is dedicated to the
values in Our Credo and strives to meet the needs of its employees and stakeholders through
compliance with law and the following evidence based strategies:
• Sustain a global workforce of individuals with many different backgrounds, abilities, cultures and
perspectives
• Maintain a work environment where each person’s dignity is respected and they have an opportunity
to advance based on their merit
• Drive innovation and growth with our business to serve markets around the world
Our approach with respect to our workforce is guided by applicable laws, internal and external
insights, global best practices and employee feedback.
 Compensation and benefits 
As part of the Company's total rewards philosophy, the Company offers competitive compensation and
benefits to attract and retain top talent. The Company is committed to fair treatment in its
compensation and benefits for employees at all levels. The Company observes legal minimum wage
provisions and exceeds them where possible. The Company's total rewards offerings include an array of
programs to support its employees' well-being, including annual performance incentive opportunities,
pension and retirement savings programs, health and welfare benefits, paid time off, leave programs,
flexible work schedules and employee assistance programs.
 Health, wellness and safety 
The Company’s investment in employee health, well-being and safety is built on its conviction that
advancing health for humanity starts with advancing the health of its employees. With the right
awareness, focus, practices and tools, the Company works to ensure that all its employees around the
world, as well as contingent workers, contractors and visitors to the Company's sites, can work
safely. The Company has continuously expanded health and well-being programs throughout the Company
and across the globe, incorporating new thinking and technologies to keep its offerings best-in-class
and to help employees achieve their personal health goals. The programs and practices the Company
provides—physical, mental, emotional and financial—help promote holistic employee health. The Company
continues to address our employees needs through J&J Flex, a hybrid model that empowers the Company’s
office-based employees to find a balance of in-person and remote work, while preserving the Company's
culture and need for face-to-face engagement and leadership.

│ Item 1A. Risk factors │
An investment in the Company’s common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties. The
Company seeks to identify, manage and mitigate risks to our business, but uncertainties and risks are
difficult to predict and many are outside of the Company’s control and cannot therefore be
eliminated. In addition to the other information in this report and the Company’s other filings with
the SEC, investors should consider carefully the factors set forth below. Investors should be aware
that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and that the following is not meant
to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties. If known or unknown risks or
uncertainties materialize, the Company’s business, results of operations or financial condition could
be adversely affected, potentially in a material way.
 Risks related to our business, industry and operations 
The Company’s businesses operate in highly competitive product markets and competitive pressures
could adversely affect the Company’s earnings.
The Company faces substantial competition in its two operating segments and in all geographic
markets. The Company’s businesses compete with companies of all sizes on the basis of cost-
effectiveness, technological innovations, intellectual property rights, product performance, real or
perceived product advantages, pricing and availability and rate of reimbursement. The Company also
competes with other market participants in securing rights to acquisitions, collaborations and
licensing agreements with third parties. Competition for rights to product candidates and
technologies may result in significant investment and acquisition costs and onerous agreement terms
for the Company. Competitors’ development of more effective or less costly products, and/or their
ability to secure patent and other intellectual property rights and successfully market products
ahead of the Company, could negatively impact sales of the Company’s existing products as well as its
ability to bring new products to market despite significant prior investment in the related product
development. The Company may also experience operational and financial risk in connection with
acquisitions if we are unable to fully identify potential risks and liabilities associated with
acquired businesses or products, successfully integrate operations and employees, and successfully
identify and realize synergies with existing businesses while containing acquisition-related strain
on our management, operations and financial resources.
For the Company’s Innovative Medicine businesses, loss of patent exclusivity for a product often is
followed by a substantial reduction in sales as competitors gain regulatory approval for generic,
biosimilar and other competing products and enter the market. For the Company’s MedTech businesses,
technological innovation, product quality, reputation and customer service are especially important
to competitiveness. Development by other companies of new or improved products, processes and
technologies could threaten to make the Company’s products or technologies less desirable, less
economical or obsolete. The Company’s business and operations will be negatively impacted if we are
unable to introduce new products or technological advances that are safe, more effective, more
effectively marketed or otherwise outperform those of our competitors.
Interruptions and delays in manufacturing operations could adversely affect the Company’s business,
sales and reputation.
The Company’s manufacturing of products requires the timely delivery of sufficient amounts of
complex, high-quality components and materials. The Company’s subsidiaries operate 64 manufacturing
facilities as well as sourcing from thousands of suppliers around the world. The Company has in the
past, and may in the future, face unanticipated interruptions and delays in manufacturing through its
internal or external supply chain. Manufacturing disruptions can occur for many reasons including
regulatory action, production quality deviations or safety issues, labor disputes, labor shortages,
site-specific incidents (such as fires), natural disasters such as hurricanes and other severe
weather events, raw material shortages, lack of available inspectors, political unrest, terrorist
attacks and epidemics or pandemics. Such delays and difficulties in manufacturing can result in
product shortages, declines in sales and reputational impact as well as significant remediation and
related costs associated with addressing the shortage.
The Company relies on third parties to manufacture and supply certain of our products. Any failure by
or loss of a third-party manufacturer or supplier could result in delays and increased costs, which
may adversely affect our business.
The Company relies on third parties to manufacture and supply certain of our raw materials, component
parts and products. We depend on these third-party manufacturers to allocate to us a portion of their
manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality and at
acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis and at
acceptable prices. However, we cannot guarantee that these third-party manufacturers will be able to
meet our near-term or long-term manufacturing requirements, which could result in lost sales and have
an adverse effect on our business.
 2024 Annual Report9 
Other risks associated with our reliance on third parties to manufacture these products include
reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance, misappropriation of the
Company’s intellectual property, limited ability to manage our inventory, possible breach of the
manufacturing agreement by the third party and the possible termination or nonrenewal of the
manufacturing agreement by the third party at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us. Moreover,
if any of our third-party manufacturers suffers any damage to facilities, loses benefits under
material agreements, experiences power outages, encounters financial difficulties, is unable to
secure necessary raw materials from its suppliers or suffers any other reduction in efficiency, the
Company may experience significant business disruption. In the event of any such disruption, the
Company would need to seek and source other qualified third-party manufacturers, likely resulting in
further delays and increased costs which could affect our business adversely.
Counterfeit versions of our products could harm our patients and have a negative impact on our
revenues, earnings, reputation and business.
Our industry continues to be challenged by the vulnerability of distribution channels to illegal
counterfeiting and the presence of counterfeit products in a growing number of markets and over the
Internet. Third parties may illegally distribute and sell counterfeit versions of our products, which
do not meet our rigorous manufacturing and testing standards. To distributors and patients,
counterfeit products may be visually indistinguishable from the authentic version. Counterfeit
medicines pose a risk to patient health and safety because of the conditions under which they are
manufactured – often in unregulated, unlicensed, uninspected and unsanitary sites – as well as the
lack of regulation of their contents.
The industry’s failure to mitigate the threat of counterfeit medicines could adversely impact our
business and reputation by impacting patient confidence in our authentic products, potentially
resulting in lost sales, product recalls, and an increased threat of litigation. In addition,
diversion of our products from their authorized market into other channels may result in reduced
revenues and negatively affect our profitability.
Global health crises, pandemics, epidemics, or other outbreaks could adversely disrupt or impact
certain aspects of the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.
We are subject to risks associated with global health crises, epidemics, pandemics and other
outbreaks (such incident(s), a health crisis or health crises). The spread of health crises have
caused and may cause the Company to modify its business practices, and take further actions as may be
required by government authorities or as the Company determines are in the best interests of our
patients, customers, employees and business partners under such circumstances. Impacts to the Company
have included and may include adverse impacts to results of operations and financial condition,
including lower sales and reduced customer demand and usage of certain of our products. While the
Company has robust business continuity plans in place across our global supply chain network designed
to help mitigate the impact of health crises, these efforts may not completely prevent our business
from being adversely affected in the event of a health crisis. Health crises could adversely impact
the Company’s operations, including, among other things, our manufacturing operations, supply chain,
third-party suppliers, sales and marketing, and clinical trial operations. Any of these factors could
adversely affect the Company’s business, financial results, and global economic conditions generally.
Risks related to government regulation and legal proceedings
Global sales in the Company’s Innovative Medicine and MedTech segments may be negatively impacted by
healthcare reforms and increasing pricing pressures.
Sales of the Company’s Innovative Medicine and MedTech products are significantly affected by
reimbursements by third-party payors such as government healthcare programs, private insurance plans
and managed care organizations. As part of various efforts to contain healthcare costs, these payors
are putting downward pressure on prices at which products will be reimbursed. In the U.S., increased
purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of Medicare, Medicaid, and private sector
beneficiaries, in part due to continued consolidation among healthcare providers, could result in
further pricing pressures. In addition, recent legislation and ongoing political scrutiny on pricing,
coverage and reimbursement could result in additional pricing pressures. Specifically, the Inflation
Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) has changed Medicare Part D benefit design and has subjected certain of
the Company's products to government-established pricing beginning in 2026 and may subject additional
products in the future. Failure to adhere to the government's interpretations of the law pending
ongoing litigation may expose the Company to penalties. In addition, change to Medicare Part D could
have a negative impact on U.S. Innovative Medicine sales. Further, increased third-party utilization
of the 340B Federal Drug Discount Program from expanded interpretations of the statute and program
abuse may have a negative impact on the Company's financial performance. Outside the U.S., numerous
major markets, including the EU, United Kingdom, Japan and China, have pervasive government
involvement in funding healthcare and, in that regard, directly or indirectly impose price controls,
limit access to, or reimbursement for, the Company’s products, or reduce the value of its
intellectual property protection.
 10 
We are subject to an increasing number of costly and complex governmental regulations in the
countries in which operations are conducted which may materially adversely affect the Company’s
financial condition and business operations.
As described in Item 1. Business, the Company is subject to an increasing number of extensive
government laws and regulations, investigations and legal action by national, state and local
government agencies in the U.S. and other countries in which it operates. For example, changes to the
U.S. FDA’s timing or requirements for approval or clearance of our products may have a negative
impact on our ability to bring new products to market. New and changing laws, regulations, executive
orders and other directives may also impose deadlines on the Company, or its third-party suppliers,
manufacturers or other partners and providers, for which there may be insufficient time to implement
changes to comply with such new regulations and may result in manufacturing delays or other supply
chain constraints. If the Company is unable to identify ways to mitigate these delays or constraints,
there may be an adverse effect on sales and access to our products.
The Company is subject to significant legal proceedings that can result in significant expenses,
fines and reputational damage.
In the ordinary course of business, Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous
claims and lawsuits involving various issues such as product liability, patent disputes and claims
that their product sales, marketing and pricing practices violate various antitrust, unfair trade
practices and/or consumer protection laws. The Company’s more significant legal proceedings are
described in Note 19 Legal proceedings under Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included
in Item 8 of this Report. Litigation, in general, and securities, derivative action, class action and
multi-district litigation, in particular, can be expensive and disruptive. Some of these matters may
include thousands of plaintiffs, may involve parties seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts,
including punitive or exemplary damages, and may remain unresolved for several years. For example,
the Company is a defendant in numerous lawsuits arising out of the use of body powders containing
talc, primarily JOHNSON’S Baby Powder. While the Company believes it has substantial defenses in
these matters, it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome of litigation. The Company has been
and could in the future be required to pay significant amounts as a result of settlements or
judgments in these matters, potentially in excess of accruals, including matters where the Company
could be held jointly and severally liable among other defendants. The resolution of, or increase in
accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period could have a material adverse
effect on the Company’s results of operations and cash flows for that period. The Company does not
purchase third-party product liability insurance; however, the Company utilizes a wholly owned
captive insurance company subject to certain limits.
Product reliability, safety and effectiveness concerns can have significant negative impacts on sales
and results of operations, lead to litigation and cause reputational damage.
Product concerns, whether raised internally or by litigants, regulators or consumer advocates, and
whether or not based on scientific evidence, can result in safety alerts, product recalls,
governmental investigations, regulatory action on the part of the U.S. FDA (or its counterpart in
other countries), private claims and lawsuits, payment of fines and settlements, declining sales and
reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and
consumer trust in the Company’s products. Product recalls have in the past, and could in the future,
prompt government investigations and inspections, the shutdown of manufacturing facilities, continued
product shortages and related sales declines, significant remediation costs, reputational damage,
possible civil penalties and criminal prosecution.
The Company faces significant regulatory scrutiny, which imposes significant compliance costs and
exposes the Company to government investigations, legal actions and penalties.
The rapid increase in new government laws and regulations imposes significant compliance costs to the
Company and a failure of the Company to timely implement changes to comply with these new laws may
expose the Company to investigations, legal actions or penalties. Regulatory issues regarding
compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) (and comparable quality regulations in
foreign countries) by manufacturers of drugs and devices can lead to fines and penalties, product
recalls, product shortages, interruptions in production, delays in new product approvals and
litigation. In addition, the marketing, pricing and sale of the Company’s products are subject to
regulation, investigations and legal actions including under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act, the Medicaid Rebate Program, federal and state false claims acts, state unfair trade practices
acts and consumer protection laws. Scrutiny of healthcare industry business practices by government
agencies and state attorneys general in the U.S., and any resulting investigations and prosecutions,
carry risk of significant civil and criminal penalties including, but not limited to, debarment from
participation in government healthcare programs. Any such debarment could have a material adverse
effect on the Company’s business and results of operations. The most significant current
investigations and litigation brought by government agencies are described in Note 19 Legal
proceedings—Government proceedings under Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in
Item 8 of this Report.
 2024 Annual Report11 
Changes in tax laws or exposures to additional tax liabilities could negatively impact the Company’s
operating results.
Changes in tax laws or regulations around the world, including in the U.S. and as led by the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, such as the enactment by certain EU and non-EU
countries, and the anticipated enactment by additional countries, of a global minimum tax, could
negatively impact the Company’s effective tax rate and results of operations. A change in statutory
tax rate or certain international tax provisions in any country would result in the revaluation of
the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the
period in which the new tax law is enacted. This change would result in an expense or benefit
recorded to the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The Company closely monitors these
proposals as they arise in the countries where it operates. Changes to tax laws or regulations may
occur at any time, and any related expense or benefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter
and year in which the law change is enacted.
See Note 8 Income taxes under Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of
this Report for additional information.
The Company conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and is addressing tax
audits and disputes with many tax authorities. In connection with various government initiatives,
companies are required to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the
world, which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in other countries. The Company
regularly assesses the likely outcomes of its tax audits and disputes to determine the
appropriateness of its tax reserves. However, any tax authority could take a position on tax
treatment that is contrary to the Company’s expectations, which could result in tax liabilities in
excess of reserves.
 Risks related to our intellectual property 
The Company faces increased challenges to intellectual property rights central to its business.
The Company owns or licenses a significant number of patents and other proprietary rights relating to
its products and manufacturing processes. These rights are essential to the Company’s businesses and
the inability of the Company to secure and maintain these rights may have a detrimental impact on the
Company’s financial results. Public policy, both within and outside the U.S., has become increasingly
unfavorable toward intellectual property rights. The Company cannot be certain that it will secure
and maintain adequate patent protection for new products and technologies in the United States and
other important markets.
Competitors routinely challenge the validity or extent of the Company’s owned or licensed patents and
proprietary rights through litigation, interferences, oppositions and other proceedings, such as
inter partes review (IPR) proceedings before the United States Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO).
These proceedings absorb resources and can be protracted as well as unpredictable. In addition,
others may claim the Company has infringed their intellectual property rights, including copyrights,
patents, or trademarks, and/or has misappropriated their trade secrets, any of which could result in
an injunction and/or the need to pay past damages and future royalties and adversely affect the
competitive position and sales of our products.
The Company has faced increasing patent challenges from third parties seeking to manufacture and
market generic and biosimilar versions of the Company’s key pharmaceutical products prior to
expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. In the event the Company is not
successful in defending its patents against such challenges, or upon the “at-risk” launch by the
generic or biosimilar firm of its product, the Company can lose a major portion of revenues for the
referenced product in a very short period of time. Current legal proceedings involving the Company’s
patents and other intellectual property rights are described in Note 19 Legal
proceedings—Intellectual property under Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in
Item 8 of this Report.
 12 
Risks related to product development, regulatory approval and commercialization
Significant challenges or delays in the Company’s innovation, development and implementation of new
products, technologies and indications could have an adverse impact on the Company’s long-term
success.
The Company’s continued growth and success depends on its ability to innovate and develop new and
differentiated products and services that address the evolving healthcare needs of patients,
providers and consumers. Development of successful products and technologies is also necessary to
offset revenue losses when the Company’s existing products lose market share due to various factors
such as competition and loss of patent exclusivity. New products introduced within the past five
years accounted for approximately 25% of 2024 sales. The Company cannot be certain when or whether it
will be able to develop, license or otherwise acquire companies, products and technologies, whether
particular product candidates will be granted regulatory approval, and, if approved, whether the
products will be commercially successful.
The Company pursues product development through internal research and development as well as through
collaborations, acquisitions, joint ventures and licensing or other arrangements with third parties.
In all of these contexts, developing new products, particularly pharmaceutical and biotechnology
products and medical devices, requires significant investment of resources over many years. Only a
very few biopharmaceutical research and development programs result in commercially viable products.
The process depends on many factors including the ability to: discern patients’ and healthcare
providers’ future needs; develop promising new compounds, strategies and technologies; achieve
successful clinical trial results; secure effective intellectual property protection; obtain
regulatory approvals on a timely basis; and, if and when they reach the market, successfully
differentiate the Company’s products from competing products and approaches to treatment. Moreover,
the development and regulatory approval of new products may be delayed due to limits on federal
agency budgets or personnel, including reductions to the U.S. FDA’s budget, employees, and
operations, which may lead to slower response times and longer review periods. After approval, new
products or enhancements to existing products may not be accepted quickly or significantly in the
marketplace due to product and price competition, changes in customer preferences or healthcare
purchasing patterns, resistance by healthcare providers or uncertainty over third-party
reimbursement. Even following initial regulatory approval, the success of a product can be adversely
impacted by safety and efficacy findings in larger real-world patient populations, as well as market
entry of competitive products.
The Company leverages the use of data science, machine learning and other forms of AI and emerging
technologies across varying parts of its business and operations, and the introduction and
incorporation of AI may result in unintended consequences or other new or expanded risks and
liabilities. AI technology is continuously evolving, and the AI technologies we develop and adopt may
become obsolete earlier than planned. Our investments in these technologies may not result in the
benefits we anticipate or enable us to obtain or maintain a competitive advantage. The application of
AI in our business is emerging and evolving alongside new laws and regulations that may entail
significant costs or ultimately limit our ability to continue the use of these technologies. These
technologies also carry inherent risks related to data privacy and security further described below.
 Risks related to financial and economic market conditions 
The Company faces a variety of financial, economic, legal, social and political risks associated with
conducting business internationally.
The Company’s extensive operations and business activity throughout the world are accompanied by
certain financial, economic, legal, social and political risks, including those listed below.
Foreign currency exchange : In fiscal 2024, approximately 43% of the Company’s sales occurred outside
of the U.S., with approximately 23% in Europe, 5% in the Western Hemisphere, excluding the U.S., and
15% in the Asia-Pacific and Africa region. Changes in non-U.S. currencies relative to the U.S. dollar
impact the Company’s revenues and expenses. While the Company uses financial instruments to mitigate
the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on its cash flows, unhedged exposures continue
to be subject to currency fluctuations. In addition, the weakening or strengthening of the U.S.
dollar may result in significant favorable or unfavorable translation effects when the operating
results of the Company’s non-U.S. business activity are translated into U.S. dollars.
Inflation and currency devaluation risks : The Company faces challenges in maintaining profitability
of operations in economies experiencing high inflation rates. Specifically, the Company has accounted
for operations in Argentina, Turkey, Venezuela and Egypt (beginning in the fiscal fourth quarter of
2024) as highly inflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. While
the Company strives to maintain profit margins in these areas through cost reduction programs,
productivity improvements and periodic price increases, it might experience operating losses as a
result of continued inflation.
 2024 Annual Report13 
In addition, the impact of currency devaluations in countries experiencing high inflation rates or
significant currency exchange fluctuations could negatively impact the Company’s operating results.
Illegal importation of pharmaceutical products : The illegal importation of pharmaceutical products
from countries where government price controls or other market dynamics result in lower prices may
adversely affect the Company’s sales and profitability in the U.S. and other countries in which the
Company operates. With the exception of limited quantities of prescription drugs for personal use,
foreign imports of pharmaceutical products are illegal under current U.S. law. However, the volume of
illegal imports continues to rise as the ability of patients and other customers to obtain the lower-
priced imports has grown significantly.
Anti-bribery and other regulations : The Company is subject to various federal and foreign laws that
govern its international business practices with respect to payments to government officials. Those
laws include the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which prohibits U.S. publicly traded
companies from promising, offering, or giving anything of value to foreign officials with the corrupt
intent of influencing the foreign official for the purpose of helping the Company obtain or retain
business or gain any improper advantage. The Company’s business is heavily regulated and therefore
involves significant interaction with foreign officials. Also, in many countries outside the U.S.,
the healthcare providers who prescribe human pharmaceuticals are employed by the government and the
purchasers of human pharmaceuticals are government entities; therefore, the Company’s interactions
with these prescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the FCPA. In addition to the
U.S. application and enforcement of the FCPA, various jurisdictions in which the Company operates
have laws and regulations, including the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, aimed at preventing and penalizing
corrupt and anticompetitive behavior. Enforcement activities under these laws could subject the
Company to additional administrative and legal proceedings and actions, which could include claims
for civil penalties, criminal sanctions, and administrative remedies, including exclusion from
healthcare programs.
Other financial, economic, legal, social and political risks . Other risks inherent in conducting
business globally include:
• local and regional economic environments and policies in the markets that we serve, including
interest rates, monetary policy, inflation, economic growth, recession, commodity prices, and
currency controls or other limitations on the ability to expatriate cash;
• protective economic policies taken by governments, such as trade protection measures, increased
antitrust reporting requirements and enforcement activity, and import/export licensing requirements;
• compliance with local regulations and laws including, in some countries, regulatory requirements
restricting the Company’s ability to manufacture or sell its products in the relevant market;
• diminished protection of intellectual property and contractual rights in certain jurisdictions;
• potential nationalization or expropriation of the Company’s foreign assets;
• political or social upheavals, economic instability, repression, or human rights issues; and
• geopolitical events, including natural disasters, disruptions to markets due to war, armed
conflict, terrorism, epidemics or pandemics.
Due to the international nature of the Company's business, geopolitical or economic changes or
events, including global tensions and war, could adversely affect our business, results of operations
or financial condition.
As described above, the Company has extensive operations and business activity throughout the world.
Global tensions, conflict and/or war among any of the countries in which we conduct business or
distribute our products may result in foreign currency volatility, decreased demand for our products
in affected countries, and challenges to our global supply chain related to increased costs of
materials and other inputs for our products and suppliers. Most recently, we have experienced, and
expect to continue to experience, impacts to the Company's business resulting from the Russia-Ukraine
war, rising conflict in the Middle East as well as increasing tensions between the U.S. and China. In
response to heightened conflict, such as the Russia-Ukraine war, governments may impose export
controls and broad financial and economic sanctions. Our business and operations may be further
impacted by the imposition of tariffs, trade protection measures or other policies adopted by any
country that favor domestic companies and technologies over foreign competitors. Additional sanctions
or other measures may be imposed by the global community, including but not limited to limitations on
our ability to file, prosecute and maintain patents, trademarks and other intellectual property
rights. Furthermore, in some countries, such as in Russia, action may be taken that allows companies
and individuals to exploit inventions owned by patent holders from the United States and many other
countries without consent or compensation and we may not be able to prevent third parties from
practicing the Company's inventions in Russia or from selling or importing products in and into
Russia. In addition, the U.S. government recently announced tariffs on products manufactured in
several jurisdictions, including China, Mexico and Canada, and has
 14 
made announcements regarding the potential imposition of tariffs on other jurisdictions. While
certain of the announced tariffs have been delayed, the U.S. government may in the future pause,
reimpose or increase tariffs, and countries subject to such tariffs have and in the future may impose
reciprocal tariffs or other restrictive trade measures in response. Any of these actions could
increase uncertainties and associated risks relating to the Company’s global operations.
Weak financial performance, failure to maintain a satisfactory credit rating or disruptions in the
financial markets could adversely affect our liquidity, capital position, borrowing costs and access
to capital markets.
We currently maintain investment grade credit ratings with Moody’s Investors Service and Standard &
Poor’s Ratings Services. Rating agencies routinely evaluate us, and their ratings of our long-term
and short-term debt are based on a number of factors. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit
rating agency, whether as a result of our actions or factors which are beyond our control, can
increase the cost of borrowing under any indebtedness we may incur, reduce market capacity for our
commercial paper or require the posting of additional collateral under our derivative contracts.
There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our credit ratings, and any additional
actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings, including any announcement that
our ratings are under review for a downgrade, may have a negative impact on our liquidity, capital
position and access to capital markets.
 Other risks 
Our business depends on our ability to recruit and retain talented and highly skilled employees.
Our continued growth requires us to recruit and retain talented employees representing many different
backgrounds, experiences, and skill sets. The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our
industry is extremely competitive and our ability to compete depends on our ability to hire, develop
and motivate highly skilled personnel in all areas of our organization. Maintaining our brand and
reputation, as well as a credo-based work environment enables us to attract top talent. If we are
less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain highly skilled workers and key
leaders, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely
affected. In addition, effective succession planning is important to our long-term success. Any
unsuccessful implementation of our succession plans or failure to ensure effective transfer of
knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could adversely affect our business,
financial condition, or results of operations.
Climate change or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change may negatively
affect our business and results of operations.
Climate change resulting from increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases
in the atmosphere could present risks to our operations, including an adverse impact on global
temperatures, weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural
disasters. Natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, such as a hurricane, tornado,
earthquake, wildfire or flooding, may pose physical risks to our facilities and disrupt the operation
of our supply chain. The impacts of the changing climate on water resources may result in water
scarcity, limiting our ability to access sufficient high-quality water in certain locations, which
may increase operational costs.
Concern over climate change may also result in new or additional legal or regulatory requirements
designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and/or mitigate the effects of climate change on the
environment. If such laws or regulations are more stringent than current legal or regulatory
obligations, we may experience disruption in, or an increase in the costs associated with sourcing,
manufacturing and distribution of our products, which may adversely affect our business, results of
operations or financial condition. Further, the impacts of climate change have an influence on
customer preferences, and failure to provide climate-friendly products could potentially result in
loss of market share.
An information security incident, including a cybersecurity breach, could have a negative impact on
the Company’s business or reputation.
To meet business objectives, the Company relies on both internal information technology (IT) systems
and networks, and those of third parties and their vendors, to process and store sensitive data
(including confidential research, business plans, financial information, intellectual property, and
personal data that may be subject to legal protection) to ensure the continuity of the Company’s
supply chain and operations, and as part of many of the products we deliver to customers. The
extensive range of information security and cybersecurity threats, which affect companies globally,
pose a persistent risk to the security and availability of these systems and networks, including to
customer products that are connected to or rely on such systems and networks, and the
confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the Company’s sensitive data. The Company assesses
these threats, responds to attacks and breaches that it has experienced, and makes investments to
increase internal protection, detection, and response capabilities, as well as ensure the Company’s
third-party providers have required capabilities and
 2024 Annual Report15 
controls, to address this risk. Because of the frequently changing attack techniques, along with the
increased volume and sophistication of the attacks, there is the potential for the Company to be
adversely impacted. This impact could result in reputational, competitive, operational or other
business harm as well as financial costs and regulatory action. Also, increasing use of AI could
increase these risks. The Company maintains cybersecurity insurance in the event of an information
security or cyber incident; however, the coverage may not be sufficient to cover all financial,
legal, business or reputational losses.
As a result of increased global tensions, the Company expects there will continue to be, an increased
risk of information security or cybersecurity incidents, including cyberattacks perpetrated by
adversaries of countries where the Company maintains operations. Given the potential sophistication
of these attacks, the Company may not be able to address the threat of information security or
cybersecurity incidents proactively or implement adequate preventative measures and we may not be
able to detect and address any such disruption or security breach promptly, or at all, which could
adversely affect customers that use our products, our business, results of operations or financial
condition. Moreover, these threats could also impact our third-party partners resulting in compromise
of the Company's IT systems, networks and data which could negatively affect the Company.
A breach of privacy laws or unauthorized access, loss or misuse of personal data could have a
negative impact on the Company’s business or reputation.
The Company is subject to privacy and data protection laws and regulations across the globe that
impose broad compliance obligations on the collection, possession, use, storage, access, disclosure,
transfer, deletion and protection of personal data. Breach of the requirements of these laws and
regulations could result in substantial fines, penalties, governmental actions, private right of
actions, including class actions, and damage to our reputation and business. New privacy laws are
expected globally, together with greater privacy enforcement by governmental authorities globally,
particularly on data localization requirements and data transfers including international data flows.
The Company has established privacy compliance programs and controls with which our businesses
worldwide are required to comply. However, with many technology and data-driven initiatives evolving
across the Company, involving multiple vendors and third parties, there are threats that could impact
our business operations and research activities, including potential risks of unauthorized access and
loss of personal data as well as legislative actions imposing limitations and controls on the use and
sharing of personal data as well as on cross border data flows.

 Risk management and strategy 
The Company has documented cybersecurity policies and standards, assesses risks from cybersecurity
threats, and monitors information systems for potential cybersecurity issues. To protect the
Company’s information systems from cybersecurity threats, the Company uses various security tools
supporting protection, detection, and response capabilities. The Company maintains a cybersecurity
incident response plan to help ensure a timely, consistent response to actual or attempted
cybersecurity incidents impacting the Company.
The Company also identifies and assesses third-party risks within the enterprise, and through the
Company's use of third-party service providers, across a range of areas including data security and
supply chain through a structured third-party risk management program.
The Company maintains a formal information security training program for all employees that includes
training on matters such as phishing and email security best practices. Employees are also required
to complete mandatory training on data privacy.
To evaluate and enhance its cybersecurity program, the Company periodically utilizes third-party
experts to undertake maturity assessments of the Company’s information security program.
To date, the Company is not aware of any cybersecurity incident that has had or is reasonably likely
to have a material impact on the Company’s business or operations; however, because of the frequently
changing attack techniques, along with the increased volume and sophistication of the attacks, there
is the potential for the Company to be adversely impacted.This impact could result in reputational,
competitive, operational or other business harm as well as financial costs and regulatory action.
Refer to the risk factor captioned An information security incident, including a cybersecurity
breach, could have a negative impact to the Company’s business or reputation in Part I, Item 1A. Risk
factors for additional description of cybersecurity risks and potential related impacts on the
Company.
Governance - management’s responsibility
The Company takes a risk-based approach to cybersecurity and has implemented cybersecurity controls
designed to address cybersecurity threats and risks. The Chief Information Officer (CIO), who is a
member of the Company’s Executive Committee, and the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)are
responsible for assessing and managing cybersecurity risks, including security incident detection,
response, and recovery.
The Company’s CISO, in coordination with the CIO, is responsible for leading the Company’s
cybersecurity program and management of cybersecurity risk. The current CISO has over twenty-five
years of experience in information security, and his background includes technical experience,
strategy and architecture focused roles, cyber and threat experience, and various leadership roles.
Governance - board oversight
The Company’s Board of Directorsoversees the overall risk management process, including cybersecurity
risks, directly and through its committees. The Regulatory Compliance & Sustainability Committee
(RCSC) of the board is primarily responsible for oversight of risk from cybersecurity threats and
oversees compliance with applicable laws, regulations and Company policies related to, among others,
privacy and cybersecurity.
RCSC meetings include discussions of specific risk areas throughout the year including, among others,
those relating to cybersecurity. The CISO provides quarterly updates each year to RCSC on
cybersecurity matters. These reports include an overview of the cybersecurity threat landscape, key
cybersecurity initiatives to improve the Company’s risk posture, changes in the legal and regulatory
landscape relative to cybersecurity, and overviews of certain cybersecurity incidents that have
occurred within the Company and within the industry.

 Organization and business segments 
 Description of the company and business segments 
Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) have approximately 138,100 employees worldwide
engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the
healthcare field. The Company conducts business in virtually all countries of the world with the
primary focus on products related to human health and well-being.
The Company is organized into two business segments: Innovative Medicine and MedTech. The Innovative
Medicine segment is focused on the following therapeutic areas: Immunology, Infectious Diseases,
Neuroscience, Oncology, Pulmonary Hypertension, and Cardiovascular and Metabolism. Products in this
segment are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers, distributors, hospitals and healthcare
professionals for prescription use. The MedTech segment includes a broad portfolio of products used
in the Orthopaedic, Surgery, Cardiovascular (previously referred to as Interventional Solutions) and
Vision fields. These products are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used
principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and
clinics.
The Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) is the Company's Chief Executive Officer (Principal
Executive Officer).The Executive Committee is Johnson & Johnson’s senior leadership team responsible
for setting the strategy and priorities of the Company and driving accountability at all levels.
Within the strategic parameters provided by the Executive Committee, senior management groups at U.S.
and international operating companies are each responsible for their own strategic plans and the day-
to-day operations of those companies.
In all of its product lines, the Company competes with other companies both locally and globally,
throughout the world. Competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size
of the competing companies involved. Competition in research, involving the development and the
improvement of new and existing products and processes, is particularly significant. The development
of new and innovative products, as well as protecting the underlying intellectual property of the
Company's product portfolio, is important to the Company’s success in all areas of its business. The
competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research.
 Management’s objectives 
With Our Credo as the foundation, the Company believes health is everything. The Company's strength
in healthcare innovation empowers us to build a world where complex diseases are prevented, treated,
and cured, where treatments are smarter and less invasive, and solutions are personal. Through the
Company's expertise in Innovative Medicine and MedTech, the Company is uniquely positioned to
innovate across the full spectrum of healthcare solutions today to deliver the breakthroughs of
tomorrow, and profoundly impact health for humanity.
New products introduced within the past five years accounted for approximately 25% of 2024 sales. In
2024, $17.2 billion was invested in research and development reflecting management’s commitment to
create life-enhancing innovations and to create value through partnerships that will profoundly
impact of health for humanity.
Our approximately 138,100 employees are critical drivers of the Company’s success. Employees are
empowered and inspired to lead with Our Credo and purpose as guides. This allows every employee to
use the Company’s reach and size to advance the Company’s purpose, and to also lead with agility and
urgency. Leveraging the extensive resources across the enterprise enables the Company to innovate and
execute with excellence. This ensures the Company can remain focused on addressing the unmet needs of
society every day and invest for an enduring impact, ultimately delivering value to its patients,
consumers and healthcare professionals, employees, communities and shareholders.

 2024 Annual Report25 
Immunology products sales were $17.8 billion in 2024, representing a decrease of 1.2% as compared to
the prior year. The decline of STELARA (ustekinumab) sales was driven by share loss primarily due to
European biosimilar entrants. Lower sales of REMICADE (infliximab) was due to continued biosimilar
competition. The growth of TREMFYA (guselkumab) was due to market growth and share gains.
Sales of STELARA in the United States were approximately $6.7 billion in fiscal 2024. Third parties
have filed abbreviated Biologics License Applications with the FDA seeking approval to market
biosimilar versions of STELARA. The Company has settled certain litigation under the Biosimilar Price
Competition and Innovation Act of 2009. According to patent settlement and license agreements, the
Company expects continued launches of biosimilar versions of STELARA in Europe and the United States
in 2025 which will impact the Company’s sales of STELARA.
Biosimilar versions of REMICADE have been introduced in the United States and certain markets outside
the United States and additional competitors continue to enter the market. Continued infliximab
biosimilar competition will result in a further reduction in sales of REMICADE.
Infectious disease products sales were $3.4 billion in 2024, a decline of 23.1% as compared to the
prior year primarily driven by a decline in COVID-19 vaccine revenue.
Neuroscience products sales were $7.1 billion in 2024, representing a decrease of 0.4% as compared to
the prior year primarily driven by a decline in Other Neuroscience. The decline was partially offset
by the growth of SPRAVATO (esketamine) driven by the ongoing launch and increased physician and
patient demand.
Oncology products achieved sales of $20.8 billion in 2024, representing an increase of 17.7% as
compared to the prior year. Strong sales of DARZALEX (daratumumab) were driven by continued share
gains and market growth. Growth of ERLEADA (apalutamide) was primarily due to continued share gains
and market growth. Sales of CARVYKTI (ciltacabtagene autoleucel) were driven by continued share
gains, capacity expansion and manufacturing efficiencies. Additionally, sales from the ongoing
launches of TECVAYLI (teclistamab-cqyv), TALVEY (talquetamab-tgvs) and RYBREVANT (amivantamab),
included in Other Oncology, contributed to the growth. Growth was partially offset by ZYTIGA
(abiraterone acetate) due to loss of exclusivity and IMBRUVICA (ibrutinib) due to global competitive
pressures.
Pulmonary Hypertension products sales were $4.3 billion, representing an increase of 12.3% as
compared to the prior year. Sales growth of both OPSUMIT (macitentan) and UPTRAVI (selexipag) was
driven by market growth and share gains. Growth in Other Pulmonary Hypertension was driven by OPSYNVI
(macitentan/tadalafil).
Cardiovascular/Metabolism/Other products sales were $3.6 billion, a decline of 3.0% as compared to
the prior year driven by declines in Other.
The Company maintains a policy that no end customer will be permitted direct delivery of product to a
location other than the billing location. This policy impacts contract pharmacy transactions
involving non-grantee 340B covered entities for most of the Company’s drugs, subject to multiple
exceptions. Both grantee and non-grantee covered entities can maintain certain contract pharmacy
arrangements under policy exceptions. The Company has been and will continue to offer 340B discounts
to covered entities on all of its covered outpatient drugs, and it believes its policy will improve
its ability to identify inappropriate duplicate discounts and diversion prohibited by the 340B
statute. The 340B Drug Pricing Program is a U.S. federal government program requiring drug
manufacturers to provide significant discounts on covered outpatient drugs to covered entities.

The Surgery franchise sales were $9.8 billion in 2024, representing a decrease of 1.9% from 2023. The
decline in Advanced Surgery was primarily due to China volume-based procurement across all platforms
and competitive pressures in Energy and Endocutters. This was partially offset by the strength of the
portfolio and commercial execution in Biosurgery as well as the strength of new products in
Endocutters. Growth in General Surgery was primarily driven by technology penetration and benefits
from the differentiated Wound Closure portfolio as well as increased procedure volume. This growth
was offset by the negative impact of currency and the Acclarent divestiture.
The Orthopaedics franchise sales were $9.2 billion in 2024, representing an increase of 2.4% from
2023. The fiscal 2024 includes a one-time revenue recognition timing change related to certain
products across all Orthopaedic platforms in the U.S. which positively impacted the worldwide
Orthopaedics franchise growth as well as the negative impact from the near-term revenue disruption
related to the previously announced Orthopaedics restructuring. The growth in Hips reflects continued
strength of the portfolio primarily in the Anterior approach, and global procedure growth. The growth
in Knees was primarily driven by the ATTUNE portfolio, pull through related to the VELYS Robotic
assisted solution and global procedure growth. Growth in Trauma was driven by the adoption of
recently launched products. The decline in Spine, Sports & Other was primarily driven by competitive
pressures and impacts from China volume-based procurement. This was partially offset by growth in the
U.S. market.
 28 
The Cardiovascular franchise, which includes sales from Shockwave Medical (Shockwave) acquired on May
31, 2024, achieved sales of $7.7 billion in 2024, representing an increase of 21.4% from 2023.
Electrophysiology growth was driven by global procedure growth, new product performance and
commercial execution. This was partially offset by the impacts of volume-based procurement in China
and competitive pressures in Pulsed Field Ablation catheters in the U.S. Abiomed sales reflect the
strength of all major commercialized regions driven by the continued adoption of Impella 5.5 and
Impella RP.
The Vision franchise achieved sales of $5.1 billion in 2024, representing an increase of 1.5% from
2023. Contact Lenses/Other growth was primarily driven by price actions, continued strong performance
in the ACUVUE OASYS 1-Day family of products (including recent launches), impacts from a one-time
change in contract shipping terms in the U.S. and lapping of prior year impacts of Russian sanctions
partially offset by U.S. distributor stocking dynamics. Surgical growth was primarily driven by the
continued strength of recent innovations and commercial execution partially offset by China volume-
based procurement and competitive pressures in the U.S.

by over 130 countries worldwide. Several EU and non-EU countries have enacted Pillar Two legislation
with an initial effective date of January 1, 2024, with other aspects of the law effective in 2025 or
later. In the fiscal year 2024, the net impact of Pillar Two legislation was less than 1.0% to the
Company’s effective tax rate. While countries continue to enact new provisions or issue new
regulations, based on current guidance, the Company expects the net impact of Pillar Two in fiscal
year 2025 to be up to 1.0% to the Company’s effective tax rate.

As of December 29, 2024, the Company's notes payable and long-term debt was in excess of cash, cash
equivalents and marketable securities. As of December 29, 2024, the net debt position was $12.1
billion as compared to the prior year of $6.4 billion. The debt balance at the end of 2024 was $36.6
billion as compared to $29.3 billion in 2023. In the fiscal second quarter of 2024, the Company
issued senior unsecured notes for a total of $6.7 billion. For additional details on borrowings, see
Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The net proceeds from this offering were used to
fund the Shockwave acquisition which closed on May 31, 2024, and for general corporate purposes.
Considering recent market conditions, the Company has re-evaluated its operating cash flows and
liquidity profile and does not foresee any significant incremental risk. The Company anticipates that
operating cash flows, the ability to raise funds from external sources, borrowing capacity from
existing committed credit facilities and access to the commercial paper markets will continue to
provide sufficient resources to fund operating needs, including the Company's remaining balance to be
paid on the agreement to settle opioid litigation for approximately $1.5 billion and the
approximately $11.6 billion ($13.5 billion nominal) reserve for talc matters (See Note 19 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details). In addition, the Company monitors the
global capital markets on an ongoing basis and from time to time may raise capital when market
conditions are favorable.
On May 8, 2023, Kenvue, completed an initial public offering (the IPO) resulting in the issuance of
198,734,444 shares of its common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the Kenvue Common Stock), at an
initial public offering of $22.00 per share for net proceeds of $4.2 billion. The excess of the net
proceeds from the IPO over the net book value of the Johnson & Johnson
 34 
divested interest was $2.5 billion and was recorded to additional paid-in capital. As of the closing
of the IPO, Johnson & Johnson owned approximately 89.6% of the total outstanding shares of Kenvue
Common Stock and at July 2, 2023, the non-controlling interest of $1.3 billion associated with Kenvue
was reflected in equity attributable to non-controlling interests in the consolidated balance sheet.
On August 23, 2023, Johnson & Johnson completed the disposition of an additional 80.1% ownership of
Kenvue Common Stock through an exchange offer, which resulted in Johnson & Johnson acquiring
190,955,436 shares of the Company’s common stock in exchange for 1,533,830,450 shares of Kenvue
Common Stock. The $31.4 billion of Johnson & Johnson common stock received in the exchange offer is
recorded in Treasury stock. Following the exchange offer, the Company owned 9.5% of the total
outstanding shares of Kenvue Common Stock that was recorded in other assets within continuing
operations at the fair market value of $4.3 billion as of August 23, 2023 and $3.9 billion as of
December 31, 2023.
Johnson & Johnson divested net assets of $11.6 billion as of August 23, 2023, and the accumulated
other comprehensive loss attributable to the Consumer Health business at that date was $4.3 billion.
Additionally, at the date of the exchange offer, Johnson & Johnson decreased the non-controlling
interest by $1.2 billion to record the deconsolidation of Kenvue. This resulted in a gain on the
exchange offer of $21.0 billion that was recorded in Net earnings from discontinued operations, net
of taxes in the consolidated statements of earnings for the fiscal third quarter of 2023. This one-
time gain includes a gain of $2.8 billion on the Kenvue Common Stock retained by Johnson & Johnson.
The gain on the exchange offer qualifies as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax
purposes.
On May 15, 2024, the Company issued $3.6 billion aggregate principal amount of commercial paper and
received $3.6 billion of net cash proceeds to be used for general corporate purposes. On May 17,
2024, the Company completed a Debt-for-Equity Exchange of its remaining 182,329,550 shares of Kenvue
Common Stock for the outstanding Commercial Paper. Upon completion of the Debt-for-Equity Exchange,
the Commercial Paper was satisfied and discharged and the Company no longer owns any shares of Kenvue
Common Stock. This exchange resulted in a loss of approximately $0.4 billion recorded in Other
(income) expense.
The following table summarizes the Company’s material contractual obligations and their aggregate
maturities as of December 29, 2024: To satisfy these obligations, the Company intends to use cash

 2024 Annual Report35 
 Financing and market risk 
The Company uses financial instruments to manage the impact of foreign exchange rate changes on cash
flows. Accordingly, the Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to protect the value
of certain foreign currency assets and liabilities and to hedge future foreign currency transactions
primarily related to product costs. Gains or losses on these contracts are offset by the gains or
losses on the underlying transactions. A 10% appreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the December 29,
2024 market rates would increase the unrealized value of the Company’s forward contracts by $0.2
billion. Conversely, a 10% depreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the December 29, 2024 market rates
would decrease the unrealized value of the Company’s forward contracts by $0.2 billion. In either
scenario, the gain or loss on the forward contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the
underlying transaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated earnings and cash
flows.
The Company hedges the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and the effect on certain
assets and liabilities in foreign currency, by entering into currency swap contracts. A 1% change in
the spread between U.S. and foreign interest rates on the Company’s interest rate sensitive financial
instruments would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of the Company’s swap contracts by
approximately $1.5 billion. In either scenario, at maturity, the gain or loss on the swap contract
would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction, and therefore, would have no
impact on future anticipated cash flows.
The Company does not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Further,
the Company has a policy of only entering into contracts with parties that have at least an
investment grade credit rating. The counterparties to these contracts are major financial
institutions and there is no significant concentration of exposure with any one counterparty.
Management believes the risk of loss is remote. The Company entered into credit support agreements
(CSA) with certain derivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on respective
credit ratings and netting agreements. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional details on credit support agreements.
The Company invests in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities which carry a
degree of interest rate risk. The fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely
impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than
predicted if interest rates fall. A 1% (100 basis points) change in spread on the Company’s interest
rate sensitive investments would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of cash equivalents
and current marketable securities by less than $8.0 million.
The Company has access to substantial sources of funds at numerous banks worldwide. In June 2024, the
Company secured a new 364-day Credit Facility of $10 billion, which expires on June 25, 2025.
Interest charged on borrowings under the credit line agreement is based on either Secured Overnight
Financing Rate (SOFR) Reference Rate or other applicable market rate as allowed plus applicable
margins. Commitment fees under the agreement are not material.
Total borrowings at the end of 2024 and 2023 were $36.6 billion and $29.3 billion, respectively. The
increase in the borrowings was due to the issuance of new debt in 2024. In 2024, net debt (cash and
current marketable securities, net of debt) was $12.1 billion compared to net debt of $6.4 billion in
2023. Total debt represented 34.0% of total capital (shareholders’ equity and total debt) in 2024 and
30.0% of total capital in 2023. Shareholders’ equity per share at the end of 2024 was $29.70 compared
to $28.57 at year-end 2023.
A summary of borrowings can be found in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 Dividends 
The Company increased its dividend in 2024 for the 62 nd consecutive year. Cash dividends paid were
$4.91 per share in 2024 and $4.70 per share in 2023.
On January 2, 2025, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $1.24 per share,
payable on March 4, 2025 to shareholders of record as of February 18, 2025.

 Other information 
 Critical accounting policies and estimates 
Management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition are based on
the Company’s consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements
requires that management make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for
revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and other related disclosures. Actual results may or may not
differ from these estimates. The Company believes that the understanding of certain key accounting
policies and estimates are essential in achieving more insight into the Company’s operating results
and financial condition. These key accounting policies include revenue recognition, income taxes,
legal and self-insurance contingencies, valuation of long-lived assets, assumptions used to determine
the amounts recorded for pensions and other employee benefit plans and accounting for stock based
awards.
Revenue Recognition: The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the
terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied; generally, this occurs with the transfer of
control of the goods to customers. The Company's global payment terms are typically between 30 to 90
days. Provisions for certain rebates, sales incentives, trade promotions, coupons, product returns,
discounts to customers and governmental clawback provisions are accounted for as variable
consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales.
Product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other
market participants, as well as market conditions, including consideration of competitor pricing.
Rebates and discounts are estimated based on contractual terms, historical experience, patient
outcomes, trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served. The Company
evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily through the analysis of
wholesaler and other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as internally
generated information.
Sales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products
that have lost patent exclusivity, or that otherwise exhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to
dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically investigated and analyzed as part of
the accounting for sales return accruals.
Sales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration,
destruction in the field, or in specific areas, product recall. In accordance with the Company’s
accounting policies, the Company generally issues credit to customers for returned goods. The
Company’s sales returns reserves are accounted for in accordance with the U.S. GAAP guidance for
revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales returns reserves are recorded at full sales
value. Sales returns in the Innovative Medicine segment are almost exclusively not resalable. Sales
returns for certain franchises in the MedTech segment are typically resalable but are not material.
The Company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products. The sales returns
reserve for the total Company has been approximately 1.0% of annual net trade sales during the fiscal
years 2024, 2023 and 2022.
Promotional programs, such as product listing allowances are recorded in the same period as related
sales and include volume-based sales incentive programs. Volume-based incentive programs are based on
the estimated sales volumes for the incentive period and are recorded as products are sold. These
arrangements are evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be deferred or recorded as a
reduction of revenue. The Company also earns profit-share payments through collaborative arrangements
of certain products, which are included in sales to customers. Profit-share payments were less than
2.0% of the total revenues in fiscal year 2024 and 2023, respectively, and less than 3.0% of the
total revenues in the fiscal year 2022 and are included in sales to customers.
In addition, the Company enters into collaboration arrangements that contain multiple revenue
generating activities. Amounts due from collaborative partners for these arrangements are recognized
as each activity is performed or delivered, based on the relative selling price. Upfront fees
received as part of these arrangements are deferred and recognized over the performance period. See
Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures on collaborations.
Reasonably likely changes to assumptions used to calculate the accruals for rebates, returns and
promotions are not anticipated to have a material effect on the financial statements. The Company
currently discloses the impact of changes to assumptions in the quarterly or annual filing in which
there is a material financial statement impact.

Income Taxes: Income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable for the current year
and include the results of any difference between U.S. GAAP accounting and tax reporting, recorded as
deferred tax assets or liabilities. The Company estimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based
on enacted tax regulations and rates. Future changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded
deferred tax assets and liabilities.
The Company has unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. The Company follows U.S. GAAP,
which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement
recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
Management believes that changes in these estimates would not have a material effect on the Company's
results of operations, cash flows or financial position.
The Company has recorded deferred tax liabilities on all undistributed earnings prior to December 31,
2017 from its international subsidiaries. The Company has not provided deferred taxes on the
undistributed earnings subsequent to January 1, 2018 from certain international subsidiaries where
the earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. The Company intends to continue to
reinvest these earnings in those international operations. If the Company decides at a later date to
repatriate these earnings to the U.S., the Company would be required to provide for the net tax
effects on these amounts. The Company estimates that the tax effect of this repatriation would be
approximately $0.5 billion under currently enacted tax laws and regulations and at current currency
exchange rates. This amount does not include the possible benefit of U.S. foreign tax credits, which
may substantially offset this cost.
See Note 1 and Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding
income taxes.
Legal and Self Insurance Contingencies: The Company records accruals for various contingencies,
including legal proceedings and product liability claims as these arise in the normal course of
business. The accruals are based on management’s judgment as to the probability of losses and, where
applicable, actuarially determined estimates. The Company has self insurance through a wholly-owned
captive insurance company. In addition to accruals in the self insurance program, claims that exceed
the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated.
The Company follows the provisions of U.S. GAAP when recording litigation related contingencies. A
liability is recorded when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.
 2024 Annual Report39 
See Notes 1 and 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding product
liability and legal proceedings.
Long-Lived and Intangible Assets: The Company assesses changes, both qualitatively and
quantitatively, in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows in
evaluating the value of the Company’s property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets.
As these assumptions and estimates may change over time, it may or may not be necessary for the
Company to record impairment charges.
Employee Benefit Plans: The Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined
benefit, defined contribution and termination indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide.
These plans are based on assumptions for the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, mortality
rates, expected salary increases, healthcare cost trend rates and attrition rates. See Note 10 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on these rates.
Stock Based Compensation: The Company recognizes compensation expense associated with the issuance of
equity instruments to employees for their services. Based on the type of equity instrument, the fair
value is estimated on the date of grant using either the Black-Scholes option valuation model or a
combination of both the Black-Scholes option valuation model and Monte Carlo valuation model, and is
expensed in the financial statements over the service period. The input assumptions used in
determining fair value are the expected life, expected volatility, risk-free rate and expected
dividend yield. For performance share units, the fair market value is calculated for the two
component goals at the date of grant: adjusted operational earnings per share and relative total
shareholder return. The fair values for the earnings per share goal of each performance share unit
was estimated on the date of grant using the fair market value of the shares at the time of the
award, discounted for dividends, which are not paid on the performance share units during the vesting
period. The fair value for the relative total shareholder return goal of each performance share unit
was estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo valuation model. See Note 16 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

 Economic and market factors 
The Company is aware that its products are used in an environment where, for more than a decade,
policymakers, consumers and businesses have expressed concerns about the rising cost of healthcare.
In response to these concerns, the Company has a long-standing policy of pricing products
responsibly. For the period 2014 - 2024, in the U.S., the weighted average compound annual growth
rate of the Company’s net price increases for healthcare products (prescription and over-the-counter
drugs, hospital and professional products) was below the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI).
The Company operates in certain countries where the economic conditions continue to present
significant challenges. The Company continues to monitor these situations and take appropriate
actions. Inflation rates continue to have an effect on worldwide economies and, consequently, on the
way companies operate. The Company has accounted for operations in Argentina, Venezuela, Turkey and
Egypt (beginning in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024) as highly inflationary, as the prior three-
year cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. This did not have a material impact to the Company's
results in the period. In the face of increasing costs, the Company strives to maintain its profit
margins through cost reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic price increases.
In July 2023, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Janssen) filed litigation against the U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services as well as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services challenging the
constitutionality of the IRA's Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program. The litigation requests a
declaration that the IRA violates Janssen’s rights under the First Amendment and the Fifth Amendment
to the Constitution and therefore that Janssen is not subject to the IRA’s mandatory pricing scheme.
The impact of the IRA on our business and the broader pharmaceutical industry remains uncertain, as
litigation filed by Janssen and other pharmaceutical companies remains ongoing and while CMS has
publicly announced the maximum fair price for each of the selected drugs, implementation of the
program is still in progress. In April 2024, Janssen appealed the district court’s denial of its
summary judgment motion to the Third Circuit.
Russia-Ukraine War
Although the long-term implications of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine are difficult to predict at this
time, the financial impact of the conflict in the fiscal year 2024, including accounts receivable or
inventory reserves, was not material. As of and for each of the fiscal years ending December 29, 2024
and December 31, 2023, the business of the Company’s Russian subsidiaries represented less than 1% of
the Company’s consolidated assets and revenues. The Company does not maintain Ukraine subsidiaries
subsequent to the Kenvue separation.
In March of 2022, the Company took steps to suspend all advertising, enrollment in clinical trials,
and any additional investment in Russia. The Company continues to supply products relied upon by
patients for healthcare purposes.
Conflict in the Middle East
Although the long-term implications of the conflict in the Middle East are difficult to predict at
this time, the financial impact of the conflict in the fiscal year 2024, including accounts
receivable or inventory reserves, was not material. As of and for each of the fiscal years ending
December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the business of the Company’s Israel subsidiaries
represented 1% of the Company’s consolidated assets and represented less than 1% of revenues.
The Company is exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. A 1% change in the value of the
U.S. Dollar as compared to all foreign currencies in which the Company had sales, income or expense
in 2024 would have increased or decreased the translation of foreign sales by approximately $0.4
billion and net income by approximately $0.1 billion.
Governments around the world consider various proposals to make changes to tax laws, which may
include increasing or decreasing existing statutory tax rates. In connection with various government
initiatives, companies are required to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations
around the world, which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in other countries. A
change in statutory tax rate in any country would result in the revaluation of the Company’s deferred
tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the period in which the new tax
law is enacted. This change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the Company’s
Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The Company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the
countries where it operates. Changes to the statutory tax rate may occur at any time, and any related
expense or benefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is
enacted.
The Company faces various worldwide healthcare changes that may continue to result in pricing
pressures that include healthcare cost containment and government legislation relating to sales,
promotions, pricing and reimbursement of healthcare products.
 2024 Annual Report41 
Changes in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of healthcare products and services,
including delaying medical procedures, rationing prescription medications, reducing the frequency of
physician visits and foregoing healthcare insurance coverage may continue to impact the Company’s
businesses.
The Company also operates in an environment increasingly hostile to intellectual property rights.
Firms have filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications or Biosimilar Biological Product Applications with
the U.S. FDA or otherwise challenged the coverage and/or validity of the Company's patents, seeking
to market generic or biosimilar forms of many of the Company’s key pharmaceutical products prior to
expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. In the event the Company is not
successful in defending the patent claims challenged in the resulting lawsuits, generic or biosimilar
versions of the products at issue will be introduced to the market, resulting in the potential for
substantial market share and revenue losses for those products, and which may result in a non-cash
impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. There is also a risk that one or more
competitors could launch a generic or biosimilar version of the product at issue following regulatory
approval even though one or more valid patents are in place.
 Legal proceedings 
Johnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims
regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial, employment, indemnification and other
matters; governmental investigations; and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the
ordinary course of business.
The Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is
probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As
of December 29, 2024, the Company has determined that the liabilities associated with certain
litigation matters are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for these
matters and will continue to monitor each related legal issue and adjust accruals as might be
warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance with ASC 450-20-25,
Contingencies. For these and other litigation and regulatory matters discussed below for which a loss
is probable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of
loss beyond the amounts accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex
series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and
assumptions including timing of related payments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments
can be affected by various factors including, among other things, whether damages sought in the
proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or
is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are
significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and
unpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party
settlements; complexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties
involved. To the extent adverse awards, judgments or verdicts have been rendered against the Company,
the Company does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be
reasonably estimated.
In the Company's opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and
discussions with counsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in
the Company's balance sheet, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's
financial position. However, the resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these
matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of
operations and cash flows for that period.
See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further
information regarding legal proceedings.

 Notes to consolidated financial statements 
 1. Summary of significant accounting policies 
Principles of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries
(the Company). Intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated. Columns and rows within tables
may not add due to rounding. Percentages have been calculated using actual, non-rounded figures.
Description of the company
The Company has approximately 138,100employees worldwide engaged in the research and development,
manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the healthcare field. The Company conducts
business in virtually all countries of the world and its primary focus is on products related to
human health and well-being.
Kenvue IPO/separation and discontinued operations
On May 8, 2023, Kenvue, completed an initial public offering (the IPO) resulting in the issuance of
198,734,444shares of its common stock, par value $ 0.01per share (the “Kenvue Common Stock”), at an
initial public offering of $ 22.00per share for net proceeds of $ 4.2billion. The excess of the net
proceeds from the IPO over the net book value of the Johnson & Johnson divested interest was $
2.5billion and was recorded to additional paid-in capital. As of the closing of the IPO, Johnson &
Johnson owned approximately 89.6% of the total outstanding shares of Kenvue Common Stock and at July
2, 2023, the
non-controlling interest of $ 1.3billion associated with Kenvue was reflected in equity attributable
to non-controlling interests in the consolidated balance sheet in the fiscal second quarter of 2023.
On August 23, 2023, Johnson & Johnson completed the disposition of an additional 80.1% ownership of
the shares of Kenvue through an exchange offer. Following the exchange offer, the Company owned 9.5%
of the shares of Kenvue which were accounted for as an equity investment carried at fair value within
continuing operations. The historical results of the Consumer Health business (which previously
represented the Consumer Health business segment) are reflected as discontinued operations in the
Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements through the date of the exchange offer (see Note 21 for
additional details). Unless otherwise indicated, the information in the notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements refer only to Johnson & Johnson’s continuing operations.
In the fiscal second quarter of 2024 the Company completed a debt for equity exchange of the retained
stake in Kenvue. Upon completion of the debt for equity exchange, the Company no longer owns any
shares of Kenvue Common Stock.
Business segments
The Company is organized into twobusiness segments: Innovative Medicine and MedTech. The Innovative
Medicine segment is focused on the following therapeutic areas: Immunology, Infectious Diseases,
Neuroscience, Oncology, Pulmonary Hypertension, and Cardiovascular and Metabolic. Products in this
segment are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers, distributors, hospitals and healthcare
professionals for prescription use. The MedTech segment includes a broad portfolio of products used
in the Orthopaedic, Surgery, Cardiovascular (previously referred to as Interventional Solutions) and
Vision fields. These products are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used
principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and
clinics.
New accounting standards
Recently adopted accounting standards
ASU 2023-07: Segment Reporting (Topic 280) – Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures
The Company adopted the standard in the fiscal year 2024, which requires expanded annual and interim
disclosures for significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating
decision maker and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss. The standard was
applied retrospectively to all periods presented in the financial statements. As this accounting
standard only impacts disclosures, it did not have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated
Financial Statements. See Note 17 for the required disclosures.
 50 
Recently issued accounting standards
Not adopted as of December 29, 2024
ASU 2024-03: Income Statement – Reporting Comprehensive Income – Expense Disaggregation Disclosures
(Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses
This update requires disclosure of disaggregated information about certain income statement expense
line items on an annual and interim basis. This update will be effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2026, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027.
Early adoption is permitted. As this accounting standard only impacts disclosures, it will not have a
material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.
ASU 2023-09: Income Taxes (Topic 740) - Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
This update standardizes categories for the effective tax rate reconciliation, requires
disaggregation of income taxes and additional income tax-related disclosures. This update is required
to be effective for the Company for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2024. As this
accounting standard only impacts disclosures, it will not have a material impact on the Company’s
Consolidated Financial Statements.
Cash equivalents
The Company classifies all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of three months or less
from date of purchase as cash equivalents and all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of
greater than three months from the date of purchase as current marketable securities. The Company has
a policy of making investments only with commercial institutions that have at least an investment
grade credit rating. The Company invests its cash primarily in government securities and obligations,
corporate debt securities, money market funds and reverse repurchase agreements (RRAs).
RRAs are collateralized by deposits in the form of Government Securities and Obligations for an
amount not less than 102% of their value. The Company does not record an asset or liability as the
Company is not permitted to sell or repledge the associated collateral. The Company has a policy that
the collateral has at least an A (or equivalent) credit rating. The Company utilizes a third party
custodian to manage the exchange of funds and ensure that collateral received is maintained at 102%
of the value of the RRAs on a daily basis. RRAs with stated maturities of greater than three months
from the date of purchase are classified as marketable securities.
Investments
Investments classified as held to maturity investments are reported at amortized cost and realized
gains or losses are reported in earnings. Investments classified as available-for-sale debt
securities are carried at estimated fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded as a
component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Available-for-sale securities available for
current operations are classified as current assets; otherwise, they are classified as long term.
Management determines the appropriate classification of its investment in debt and equity securities
at the time of purchase and re-evaluates such determination at each balance sheet date. The Company
reviews its investments for impairment and adjusts these investments to fair value through earnings,
as required.
Property, plant and equipment and depreciation
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. The Company utilizes the straight-line method of
depreciation over the estimated useful lives of the assets:
 Building and building equipment 30years 
 Land and leasehold improvements 10-20years 
 Machinery and equipment 2-13years 
The Company capitalizes certain computer software and development costs, included in machinery and
equipment, when incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal
use. Capitalized software costs are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the software, which
generally range from 3to 8years.
 2024 Annual Report51 
The Company reviews long-lived assets to assess recoverability using undiscounted cash flows. When
certain events or changes in operating or economic conditions occur, an impairment assessment may be
performed on the recoverability of the carrying value of these assets. If the asset is determined to
be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset’s fair value and its
carrying value. If quoted market prices are not available, the Company will estimate fair value using
a discounted value of estimated future cash flows.
Revenue recognition
The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a contract with
the customer are satisfied; generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of the goods to
customers. The Company's global payment terms are typically between 30to 90days. Provisions for
certain rebates, sales incentives, trade promotions, coupons, product returns, discounts to customers
and governmental clawback provisions are accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as a
reduction in sales. The liability is recognized within Accrued rebates, returns, and promotions on
the consolidated balance sheet.
Product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other
market participants, as well as market conditions, including consideration of competitor pricing.
Rebates and discounts are estimated based on contractual terms, historical experience, patient
outcomes, trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served. A significant
portion of the liability related to rebates is from the sale of the Company's pharmaceutical products
within the U.S., primarily the Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid programs, which amounted to $
12.3billion and $ 11.5billion as of December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The
Company evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily through the analysis
of wholesaler and other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as internally
generated information.
Sales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products
that have lost patent exclusivity, or that otherwise exhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to
dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically investigated and analyzed as part of
the accounting for sales return accruals.
Sales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration,
destruction in the field, or in specific areas, product recall. In accordance with the Company’s
accounting policies, the Company generally issues credit to customers for returned goods. The
Company’s sales returns reserves are accounted for in accordance with the U.S. GAAP guidance for
revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales returns reserves are recorded at full sales
value. Sales returns in the Innovative Medicine segment are almost exclusively not resalable. Sales
returns for certain franchises in the MedTech segment are typically resalable but are not material.
The Company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products. The sales returns
reserve for the total Company has been approximately 1.0% of annual net trade sales during each of
the fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022.
Promotional programs, such as product listing allowances are recorded in the same period as related
sales and include
volume-based sales incentive programs. Volume-based incentive programs are based on the estimated
sales volumes for the incentive period and are recorded as products are sold. These arrangements are
evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be deferred or recorded as a reduction of revenue.
The Company also earns profit-share payments through collaborative arrangements of certain products,
which are included in sales to customers. Profit-share payments were less than 2.0% of the total
revenues in the fiscal year 2024 and 2023, respectively, and less than 3.0% of total revenues in the
fiscal year 2022 and are included in sales to customers.
See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further disaggregation of revenue.
Shipping and handling
Shipping and handling costs incurred were $ 0.9billion, $ 0.9billion and $ 0.8billion in fiscal years
2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and are included in selling, marketing and administrative expense.
The amount of revenue received for shipping and handling is less than 1.0% of sales to customers for
all periods presented.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value determined by the first-in,
first-out method.

Intangible assets and goodwill
The authoritative literature on U.S. GAAP requires that goodwill and intangible assets with
indefinite lives be assessed annually for impairment. The Company completed its annual impairment
test for 2024 in the fiscal fourth quarter. Future impairment tests will be performed annually in the
fiscal fourth quarter, or sooner if warranted. In-process research and development purchased as part
of a business combination is accounted for as an indefinite lived intangible asset until the
underlying project is completed, at which point the intangible asset will be accounted for as a
definite lived intangible asset. If warranted the purchased in-process research and development could
be written off or partially impaired depending on the underlying program.
Intangible assets that have finite useful lives continue to be amortized over their useful lives and
are reviewed for impairment when warranted by economic conditions. See Note 5 for further details on
Intangible Assets and Goodwill.
Financial instruments
As required by U.S. GAAP, all derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value.
Fair value is the exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability.
Fair value is a market-based measurement determined using assumptions that market participants would
use in pricing an asset or liability. The authoritative literature establishes a three-level
hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value, with Level 1 having the highest
priority and Level 3 having the lowest. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each
period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative is
designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge transaction.
The Company documents all relationships between hedged items and derivatives. The overall risk
management strategy includes reasons for undertaking hedge transactions and entering into
derivatives. The objectives of this strategy are: (1) minimize foreign currency exposure’s impact on
the Company’s financial performance; (2) protect the Company’s cash flow from adverse movements in
foreign exchange rates; (3) ensure the appropriateness of financial instruments; and (4) manage the
enterprise risk associated with financial institutions. See Note 6 for additional information on
Financial Instruments.
Leases
The Company determines whether an arrangement is a lease at contract inception by establishing if the
contract conveys the right to control the use of identified property, plant, or equipment for a
period of time in exchange for consideration. Right of Use (ROU) Assets and Lease Liabilities for
operating leases are included in Other assets, Accrued liabilities, and Other liabilitieson the
consolidated balance sheet. The ROU Assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the
lease term and lease liabilities represent an obligation to make lease payments arising from the
lease. Commitments under finance leases are not significant, and are included in Property, plant and
equipment, Loans and notes payable, and Long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheet.
ROU Assets and Lease Liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present
value of all minimum lease payments over the lease term. The Company uses its incremental borrowing
rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of
lease payments, when the implicit rate is not readily determinable. Lease terms may include options
to extend or terminate the lease. These options are included in the lease term when it is reasonably
certain that the Company will exercise that option. Operating lease expense is recognized on a
straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company has elected the following policy elections on
adoption: use of portfolio approach on leases of assets under master service agreements, exclusion of
short term leases on the balance sheet, and not separating lease and non-lease components.
The Company primarily has operating lease for space, vehicles, manufacturing equipment and data
processing equipment. The ROU asset pertaining to leases from continuing operations was $ 1.1billion
and $ 1.0billion in fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively. The lease liability from continuing
operations was $ 1.2billion and $ 1.1billion in fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively. The
operating lease costs from continuing operations were $ 0.2billion in fiscal years 2024, 2023 and
2022. Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities from continuing
operations were $ 0.2billion in fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022.
 2024 Annual Report53 
Product liability
Accruals for product liability claims are recorded, on an undiscounted basis, when it is probable
that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based
on existing information and actuarially determined estimates where applicable. The accruals are
adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available. The Company accrues an estimate of
the legal defense costs needed to defend each matter when those costs are probable and can be
reasonably estimated. To the extent adverse verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the
Company does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably
estimated.
The Company has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. In addition to
accruals in the self insurance program, claims that exceed the insurance coverage are accrued when
losses are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated.
Research and development
Research and development expenses are expensed as incurred in accordance with ASC 730, Research and
Development. Upfront and milestone payments made to third parties in connection with research and
development collaborations are expensed as incurred up to the point of regulatory approval. Payments
made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the
remaining useful life of the related product. Amounts capitalized for such payments are included in
other intangibles, net of accumulated amortization.
The Company enters into collaborative arrangements, typically with other pharmaceutical or
biotechnology companies, to develop and commercialize drug candidates or intellectual property. These
arrangements typically involve two (or more) parties who are active participants in the collaboration
and are exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of the
activities. These collaborations usually involve various activities by one or more parties, including
research and development, marketing and selling and distribution. Often, these collaborations require
upfront, milestone and royalty or profit share payments, contingent upon the occurrence of certain
future events linked to the success of the asset in development. Amounts due from collaborative
partners related to development activities are generally reflected as a reduction of research and
development expense because the performance of contract development services is not central to the
Company’s operations. In general, the income statement presentation for these collaborations is as
follows:
 Nature/Type of Collaboration Statement of Earnings Presentation 
 Third-party sale of product & profit Sales to customers 
 share payments received 
 Royalties/milestones paid to 
 collaborative partner (post-regulatory Cost of products sold 
 approval)* 
 Royalties received from collaborative Other income (expense), net 
 partner 
 Upfront payments & milestones paid to 
 collaborative partner (pre-regulatory Research and development expense 
 approval) 
 Research and development payments to Research and development expense 
 collaborative partner 
 Research and development payments 
 received from collaborative partner or Reduction of Research and development expense 
 government entity 
* Milestones are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized to cost of products sold over the
useful life.
For all years presented, there was no individual project that represented greater than 5% of the
total annual consolidated research and development expense other than the acquired in-process
research & development expense of $ 1.25billion to secure the global rights to the NM26 bispecific
antibody (Yellow Jersey acquisition) in fiscal year 2024.
The Company has a number of products and compounds developed in collaboration with strategic partners
including XARELTO, co-developed with Bayer HealthCare AG, IMBRUVICA, developed in collaboration and
co-marketed with Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie company and CARVYKTI, licensed and developed in
collaboration with Legend Biotech USA Inc. and Legend Biotech Ireland Limited.
Separately, the Company has a number of licensing arrangements for products and compounds including
DARZALEX, licensed from Genmab A/S.
 54 
Advertising
Costs associated with advertising are expensed in the year incurred and are included in selling,
marketing and administrative expenses. Advertising expenses worldwide, which comprised television,
radio, print media and Internet advertising, were $ 0.6billion, $ 0.5billion and $ 0.7billion in
fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Income taxes
Income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable for the current year and include the
results of any difference between U.S. GAAP accounting and tax reporting, recorded as deferred tax
assets or liabilities. The Company estimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based on enacted tax
regulations and rates. Future changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets
and liabilities in the future.
The Company has unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. The Company follows U.S. GAAP
which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement
recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
Management believes that changes in these estimates would not have a material effect on the Company's
results of operations, cash flows or financial position.
In 2017, the United States enacted into law new U.S. tax legislation, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
(TCJA). This law included provisions for a comprehensive overhaul of the corporate income tax code,
including a reduction of the statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective on January 1,
2018. The TCJA included a provision for a tax on all previously undistributed earnings of U.S.
companies located in foreign jurisdictions. Undistributed earnings in the form of cash and cash
equivalents were taxed at a rate of 15.5% and all other earnings were taxed at a rate of 8.0%. This
tax is payable over 8years and will not accrue interest. These payments began in fiscal year 2018 and
will continue through 2025. The final payment of $ 2.5billion will be made in fiscal year 2025.
The TCJA also includes provisions for a tax on global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI). GILTI is
described as the excess of a U.S. shareholder’s total net foreign income over a deemed return on
tangible assets, as provided by the TCJA. In January 2018, the FASB issued guidance that allows
companies to elect as an accounting policy whether to record the tax effects of GILTI in the period
the tax liability is generated (i.e., “period cost”) or provide for deferred tax assets and
liabilities related to basis differences that exist and are expected to affect the amount of GILTI
inclusion in future years upon reversal (i.e., “deferred method”). The Company has elected to account
for GILTI under the deferred method. The deferred tax amounts recorded are based on the evaluation of
temporary differences that are expected to reverse as GILTI is incurred in future periods.
The Company has recorded deferred tax liabilities on all undistributed earnings prior to December 31,
2017 from its international subsidiaries. The Company has not provided deferred taxes on the
undistributed earnings subsequent to January 1, 2018 from certain international subsidiaries where
the earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. The Company intends to continue to
reinvest these earnings in those international operations. If the Company decides at a later date to
repatriate these earnings to the U.S., the Company would be required to provide for the net tax
effects on these amounts. The Company estimates that the tax effect of this repatriation would be
approximately $ 0.5billion under currently enacted tax laws and regulations and at current currency
exchange rates. This amount does not include the possible benefit of U.S. foreign tax credits, which
may substantially offset this cost.
See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding income taxes.
Net earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings available to common shareholders by the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share
reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities were exercised or converted into
common stock using the treasury stock method.
Use of estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
amounts reported. Estimates are used when accounting for sales discounts, rebates, allowances and
incentives, product liabilities, income taxes, withholding taxes, depreciation, amortization,
employee benefits, contingencies and intangible asset and liability valuations. Actual results may or
may not differ from those estimates.
 2024 Annual Report55 
The Company follows the provisions of U.S. GAAP when recording litigation related contingencies. A
liability is recorded when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. The best estimate of a
loss within a range is accrued; however, if no estimate in the range is better than any other, the
minimum amount is accrued.
Supplier finance program obligations
The Company has agreements for supplier finance programs with third-party financial institutions.
These programs provide participating suppliers the ability to finance payment obligations from the
Company with the third-party financial institutions. The Company is not a party to the arrangements
between the suppliers and the third-party financial institutions. The Company’s obligations to its
suppliers, including amounts due, and scheduled payment dates (which have general payment terms of
90days), are not affected by a participating supplier’s decision to participate in the program.
Confirmed obligations under the program as of December 29, 2024, and December 31, 2023, were $
0.8billion and $ 0.7billion, respectively. The obligations are presented as Accounts payableon the
Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The rollforward of the Company's valid obligations under the program were as follows:
 2024 
 (Dollars in Millions) 
 Confirmed obligations - beginning of the year $704 
 Invoices confirmed during the year 3,048 
 Confirmed invoices paid during the year 2,964 
 Confirmed obligations - end of the year $788 
Annual closing date
The Company follows the concept of a fiscal year, which ends on the Sunday nearest to the end of the
month of December. Normally each fiscal year consists of 52 weeks, but every five or six years the
fiscal year consists of 53 weeks, and therefore includes additional shipping days, as was the case in
fiscal year 2020, and will be the case again in fiscal year 2026.

 2024 Annual Report59 
 6. Fair value measurements 
The Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to manage its exposure to the variability of cash
flows, primarily related to the foreign exchange rate changes of future intercompany products and
third-party purchases of materials denominated in a foreign currency. The Company uses cross currency
interest rate swaps to manage currency risk primarily related to borrowings. Both types of
derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges.
Additionally, the Company uses interest rate swaps as an instrument to manage interest rate risk
related to fixed rate borrowings. These derivatives are designated as fair value hedges. The Company
uses cross currency interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts designated as net
investment hedges. Additionally, the Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to offset its
exposure to certain foreign currency assets and liabilities. These forward foreign exchange contracts
are not designated as hedges and therefore, changes in the fair values of these derivatives are
recognized in earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the related foreign
currency assets and liabilities.
The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes,
or that contain credit risk related contingent features. The Company maintains credit support
agreements (CSA) with certain derivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on
respective credit ratings and netting agreements. As of December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the
total amount of cash collateral paid by the Company under the CSA amounted to $ 2.2billion and $
4.0billion net respectively, related to net investment and cash flow hedges. On an ongoing basis, the
Company monitors counter-party credit ratings. The Company considers credit non-performance risk to
be low, because the Company primarily enters into agreements with commercial institutions that have
at least an investment grade credit rating. Refer to the table on significant financial assets and
liabilities measured at fair value contained in this footnote for receivables and payables with these
commercial institutions. As of December 29, 2024, the Company had notional amounts outstanding for
forward foreign exchange contracts, cross currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps of $
45.1billion, $ 40.5billion and $ 9.0billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had
notional amounts outstanding for forward foreign exchange contracts, cross currency interest rate
swaps and interest rate swaps of $ 42.9billion, $ 39.7billion and $ 10.0billion, respectively.
All derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value
of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending
on whether the derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge
transaction. Cash exchanged for derivatives is primarily in cash flows from operating activities.
The designation as a cash flow hedge is made at the entrance date of the derivative contract. At
inception, all derivatives are expected to be highly effective. Foreign exchange contracts designated
as cash flow hedges are accounted for under the forward method and all gains/losses associated with
these contracts will be recognized in the income statement when the hedged item impacts earnings.
Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income
until the underlying transaction affects earnings, and are then reclassified to earnings in the same
account as the hedged transaction.
Gains and losses associated with interest rate swaps and changes in fair value of hedged debt
attributable to changes in interest rates are recorded to interest expense in the period in which
they occur. Gains and losses on net investment hedges are accounted through the currency translation
account within accumulated other comprehensive income. The portion excluded from effectiveness
testing is recorded through interest (income) expense using the spot method. On an ongoing basis, the
Company assesses whether each derivative continues to be highly effective in offsetting changes of
hedged items. If and when a derivative is no longer expected to be highly effective, hedge accounting
is discontinued.
The Company designated its Euro denominated notes with due dates ranging from 2024 to 2044 as a net
investment hedge of the Company's investments in certain of its international subsidiaries that use
the Euro as their functional currency in order to reduce the volatility caused by changes in exchange
rates.
As of December 29, 2024, the balance of deferred net loss on derivatives included in accumulated
other comprehensive income was $ 1.7billion after-tax. For additional information, see the
Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and Note 13. The Company expects that substantially
all of the amounts related to forward foreign exchange contracts will be reclassified into earnings
over the next 12 monthsas a result of transactions that are expected to occur over that period. The
maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging transaction exposure is 18months, excluding
interest rate contracts and net investment hedges. The amount ultimately realized in earnings may
differ as foreign exchange rates change. Realized gains and losses are ultimately determined by
actual exchange rates at maturity of the derivative.

* The December 31, 2023 balance includes the 9.5% remaining stake in Kenvue. A debt-for-equity
exchange was completed in the fiscal second quarter of 2024.
On May 15, 2024, the Company issued $ 3.6billion aggregate principal amount of commercial paper and
received $ 3.6billion of net cash proceeds to be used for general corporate purposes. On May 17,
2024, the Company completed a Debt-for-Equity Exchange of its remaining 182,329,550shares of Kenvue
Common Stock for the outstanding Commercial Paper. Upon completion of the Debt-for-Equity Exchange,
the Commercial Paper was satisfied and discharged, and the Company no longer owns any shares of
Kenvue Common Stock. This exchange resulted in a loss of approximately $ 0.4billion recorded in Other
(income) expense.
For the fiscal years ended December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023 for equity investments without
readily determinable market values, $ 171million and $ 1million, respectively, of the changes in fair
value reflected in net income were the result of impairments. There were impacts of $ 26million and $
27million, respectively, of changes in the fair value reflected in net income due to changes in
observable prices and gains on the disposal of investments.
Fair value is the exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability.
Fair value is a market-based measurement determined using assumptions that market participants would
use in pricing an asset or liability. In accordance with ASC 820, a three-level hierarchy to
prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels within the hierarchy are described
below with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest.
The fair value of a derivative financial instrument (i.e., forward foreign exchange contracts,
interest rate contracts) is the aggregation by currency of all future cash flows discounted to its
present value at the prevailing market interest rates and subsequently converted to the U.S. Dollar
at the current spot foreign exchange rate. The Company does not believe that fair values of these
derivative instruments materially differ from the amounts that could be realized upon settlement or
maturity, or that the changes in fair value will have a material effect on the Company’s results of
operations, cash flows or financial position. The Company also holds equity investments which are
classified as Level 1 and debt securities which are classified as Level 2. The Company holds
acquisition related contingent liabilities based upon certain regulatory and commercial events, which
are classified as Level 3, whose values are determined using discounted cash flow methodologies or
similar techniques for which the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or
estimations.
The following three levels of inputs are used to measure fair value:
Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
Level 2 — Significant other observable inputs.
Level 3 — Significant unobservable inputs.

impact on the effective tax rate as compared with the U.S. statutory rate.
(2) Includes the net impact of the GILTI tax, the Foreign-Derived Intangible Income deduction and
other foreign income that is taxable under the U.S. tax code as well as related foreign tax credits.
The fiscal year 2024 effective tax rate increased 4.2% as compared to the fiscal year 2023 effective
tax rate. The primary drivers of this change are discussed below.
In fiscal year 2024, The Company had more income in higher tax jurisdictions compared to fiscal year
2023, primarily in the U.S. where the Company recorded a charge of approximately $ 5.1billion in the
fiscal year of 2024 versus approximately $ 7.0billion in the fiscal year of 2023, both for the talc
matters in the United States. Both charges were recorded at an effective U.S. tax rate of
approximately 21% (for further information see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
Additionally in the fiscal year 2024, the effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by legislative
changes that went into effect for Pillar Two in some of the Company's foreign jurisdictions which are
reflected in International operations on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation. Also in
fiscal year 2024, the Company generated incremental U.S. foreign tax credits related to income
sourced and taxed outside the United States and is reflected in U.S. taxes on international income on
the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation. In 2024, the Company finalized multi-year transfer
pricing agreements with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and certain other foreign
jurisdictions. The U.S portion of the agreements were partially offset by the related tax adjustments
in the foreign jurisdictions which are reflected in U.S tax settlements and International operations,
respectively, on the Company’s effective rate reconciliation.
The fiscal year 2023 effective tax rate decreased 3.9% as compared to the fiscal year 2022 effective
tax rate as the Company recorded certain non-recurring favorable tax items in fiscal year 2023 when
compared to the prior fiscal year.
In the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023, the Company settled the U.S. Internal Revenue Service audit for
tax years 2013 through 2016 which resulted in a favorable impact to the rate of 3.0%. This settlement
was partially offset by the Company recording a $ 0.4billion decrease in expected U.S. foreign tax
credits, an unfavorable effective rate impact of 2.6%, which has been reflected as a current tax
expense in U.S. taxes on international income on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation.
In the fiscal year 2023, the Company had certain non-recurring impacts as a result of legislative tax
elections made in certain international subsidiaries which resulted in a change in the Company’s tax
basis in certain assets resulting in deferred tax re-measurements. The net impact of these non-
recurring items is a net benefit of 3.4% to the Company’s annual effective tax rate, comprised of the
following items:
• approximately $ 0.3billion of tax benefit on local deferred tax assets to record the remeasurement
of the increased tax basis, this benefit has been reflected as International operations on the
Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation. This benefit was offset by approximately $ 0.1billion of
U.S. deferred tax expense on the GILTI deferred tax liability resulting from the remeasurement of
these deferred tax assets. This has been reflected in the “U.S. tax on international income” on the
Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation.
 68 
• approximately $ 0.3billion of U.S. deferred tax benefit on the GILTI deferred tax related to an
election made by an international subsidiary resulting in a decrease in local deferred tax assets.
This has been reflected in the U.S. taxes on international income on the Company’s effective tax rate
reconciliation.
The Company also had lower income in higher tax jurisdictions vs. fiscal year 2022, primarily in the
U.S. where the Company recorded an approximately $ 7.0billion charge related to talc matters in the
United States at an effective tax rate of 21.1% (for further information see Note 19 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements).

The Company has wholly-owned international subsidiaries that have cumulative net losses. The Company
believes that it is more likely than not that these subsidiaries will generate future taxable income
sufficient to partially utilize these deferred tax assets. In certain jurisdictions, valuation
allowances have been recorded against deferred tax assets for loss carryforwards that are not more
likely than not to be realized. The net operating loss carryforwards for these international
subsidiaries that do not have an indefinite carryforward period will begin to expire in 2025 for
various amounts.

Company conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and currently has tax audits in
progress with a number of tax authorities. With respect to the United States, the Internal Revenue
Service (IRS) has completed its audit for the tax years through 2016 and has commenced the audit for
tax years 2017 through 2020. The Company recently finalized multi-year transfer pricing agreements
with the IRS and certain other foreign jurisdictions in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024.
In other major jurisdictions where the Company conducts business, the years that remain open to tax
audits go back to the year 2013. The Company believes it is possible that some tax audits may be
completed over the next twelve months by taxing authorities in some jurisdictions. The Company
anticipates a change in uncertain tax positions of approximately $ 200million in certain
jurisdictions in the next twelve months due to the expected expiration of the statute of limitations.
However, generally the Company is not able to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of
any other future tax payments, audit settlements, or changes in uncertain tax positions.
The Company classifies liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties
as long-term liabilities. Interest expense and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are
classified as income tax expense. The Company recognized after tax interest expense of $ 217million,
$ 99million and $ 136million in fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The total amount of
accrued interest was $ 274million and $ 264million in fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively.
 9. Employee related obligations 
At the end of fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, employee related obligations recorded on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets were:
 (Dollars in Millions) 2024 2023 
 Pension benefits $2,968 3,129 
 Postretirement benefits 1,920 1,963 
 Postemployment benefits 2,910 2,527 
 Deferred compensation 49 68 
 Total employee obligations 7,847 7,687 
 Less current benefits payable 592 538 
 Employee related obligations — $7,255 7,149 
 non-current 
Prepaid employee related obligations of $ 6,046million and $ 4,992million for 2024 and 2023,
respectively, are included in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

 10. Pensions and other benefit plans 
The Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit, defined
contribution and termination indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide. The Company also
provides post-retirement benefits, primarily healthcare, to all eligible U.S. retired employees and
their dependents.
Many international employees are covered by government-sponsored programs and the cost to the Company
is not significant.
In the U.S., non-union pension benefits for employees hired before January 1, 2015 are primarily
based on the employee’s compensation during the last five yearsbefore retirement and the number of
years of service (the Final Average Pay formula). U.S. pension benefits for employees hired after
2014, are calculated using a different formula based on employee compensation over total years of
service (the Retirement Value formula).
In January 2021, the Company announced that, effective on January 1, 2026, all eligible U.S. non-
union employees, regardless of hire date, will earn benefits under the Retirement Value formula. This
amendment does not affect the benefits accrued under the Final Average Pay formula for service before
January 1, 2026.
International subsidiaries have plans under which funds are deposited with trustees, annuities are
purchased under group contracts, or reserves are provided.
The Company does not fund retiree healthcare benefits in advance and has the right to modify these
plans in the future.
In 2024 and 2023 the Company used December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, as the
measurement date for all U.S. and international retirement and other benefit plans.
Net periodic benefit costs for the Company’s defined benefit retirement plans and other benefit plans
for 2024, 2023 and 2022 include the following components:

The service cost component of net periodic benefit cost is presented in the same line items on the
Consolidated Statement of Earnings where other employee compensation costs are reported, including
Cost of products sold, Research and development expense, Selling, marketing and administrative
expenses, and Net earnings from discontinued operations, net of taxes if related to the separation of
Kenvue. All other components of net periodic benefit cost are presented as part of Other (income)
expense, net on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, with the exception of certain amounts for
curtailments and settlements, which are reported in Net earnings from discontinued operations, net of
taxes if related to the separation of Kenvue (as noted above).
Unrecognized gains and losses for the U.S. pension plans are amortized over the average remaining
future service for each plan. For plans with no active employees, they are amortized over the average
life expectancy. The amortization of gains and losses for the other U.S. benefit plans is determined
by using a 10% corridor of the greater of the market value of assets or the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation. Total unamortized gains and losses in excess of the corridor are
amortized over the average remaining future service.
Prior service costs/benefits for the U.S. pension plans are amortized over the average remaining
future service of plan participants at the time of the plan amendment. Prior service cost/benefit for
the other U.S. benefit plans is amortized over the average remaining service to full eligibility age
of plan participants at the time of the plan amendment.

The Company’s discount rates are determined by considering current yield curves representing high
quality, long-term fixed income instruments. The resulting discount rates are consistent with the
duration of plan liabilities. The Company's methodology in determining service and interest cost uses
duration specific spot rates along that yield curve to the plans' liability cash flows.
The expected rates of return on plan asset assumptions represent the Company's assessment of long-
term returns on diversified investment portfolios globally. The assessment is determined using
projections from external financial sources, long-term historical averages, actual returns by asset
class and the various asset class allocations by market.

 2024 Annual Report73 
The Company plans to continue to fund its U.S. Qualified Plans to comply with the Pension Protection
Act of 2006. International Plans are funded in accordance with local regulations. Additional
discretionary contributions are made when deemed appropriate to meet the long-term obligations of the
plans. For certain plans, funding is not a common practice, as funding provides no economic benefit.
Consequently, the Company has several pension plans that are not funded.
In 2024, the Company contributed $ 122million and $ 107million to its U.S. and international pension
plans, respectively.
The following table displays the funded status of the Company's U.S. Qualified & Non-Qualified
pension plans and international funded and unfunded pension plans at December 31, 2024 and December

Each pension plan is overseen by a local committee or board that is responsible for the overall
administration and investment of the pension plans. In determining investment policies, strategies
and goals, each committee or board considers factors including, local pension rules and regulations;
local tax regulations; availability of investment vehicles (separate accounts, commingled accounts,
insurance funds, etc.); funded status of the plans; ratio of actives to retirees; duration of
liabilities; and other relevant factors including: diversification, liquidity of local markets and
liquidity of base currency. A majority of the Company’s pension funds are open to new entrants and
are expected to be on-going plans. Permitted investments are primarily liquid and/or listed, with
little reliance on illiquid and non-traditional investments such as hedge funds.
 74 
The Company’s retirement plan asset allocation at the end of 2024 and 2023 and target allocations for
2025 are as follows:
 Percent of Target 
 Plan Assets Allocation 
 Worldwide Retirement Plans 2024 2023 2025 
 Equity securities 55 % 58 % 54 % 
 Debt securities 45 42 46 
 Total plan assets 100 % 100 % 100 % 
Determination of fair value of plan assets
The Plan has an established and well-documented process for determining fair values. Fair value is
based upon quoted market prices, where available. If listed prices or quotes are not available, fair
value is based upon models that primarily use, as inputs, market-based or independently sourced
market parameters, including yield curves, interest rates, volatilities, equity or debt prices,
foreign exchange rates and credit curves.
While the Plan believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market
participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of
certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting
date.
Valuation hierarchy
The authoritative literature establishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in
measuring fair value. The levels within the hierarchy are described in the table below with Level 1
having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest.
The Net Asset Value (NAV) is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund, minus its
liabilities, and then divided by the number of shares outstanding.
A financial instrument’s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level
of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the investments measured at fair
value.
• Short-term investment funds — Cash and quoted short-term instruments are valued at the closing
price or the amount held on deposit by the custodian bank. Other investments are through investment
vehicles valued using the NAV provided by the administrator of the fund. The NAV is a quoted price in
a market that is not active and classified as Level 2.
• Government and agency securities — A limited number of these investments are valued at the closing
price reported on the major market on which the individual securities are traded. Where quoted prices
are available in an active market, the investments are classified within Level 1 of the valuation
hierarchy. If quoted market prices are not available for the specific security, then fair values are
estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or
discounted cash flows. When quoted market prices for a security are not available in an active
market, they are classified as Level 2.
• Debt instruments — A limited number of these investments are valued at the closing price reported
on the major market on which the individual securities are traded. Where quoted prices are available
in an active market, the investments are classified as Level 1. If quoted market prices are not
available for the specific security, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted
prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows and are classified as
Level 2. Level 3 debt instruments are priced based on unobservable inputs.
• Equity securities — Equity securities are valued at the closing price reported on the major market
on which the individual securities are traded. Substantially all equity securities are classified
within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.
• Commingled funds — These investment vehicles are valued using the NAV provided by the fund
administrator. Assets in the Level 2 category have a quoted market price.
• Other assets — Other assets are represented primarily by limited partnerships. These investment
vehicles are valued using the NAV provided by the fund administrator. Other assets that are exchange
listed and actively traded are classified as Level 1, while inactively traded assets are classified
as Level 2.

* Includes impact of curtailments and settlements in connection with separation from Kenvue.
 14. International currency translation 
For translation of its subsidiaries operating in non-U.S. Dollar currencies, the Company has
determined that the local currencies of its international subsidiaries are the functional currencies
except those in highly inflationary economies, which are defined as those which have had compound
cumulative rates of inflation of 100% or more during the past three years, or where a substantial
portion of its cash flows are not in the local currency. For the majority of the Company's
subsidiaries the local currency is the functional currency.
In consolidating international subsidiaries, balance sheet currency effects are recorded as a
component of accumulated other comprehensive income. The other current and non-current assets line
within the Statement of Cash flows includes the impact of foreign currency translation. This equity
account includes the results of translating certain balance sheet assets and liabilities at current
exchange rates and some accounts at historical rates, except for those located in highly inflationary
economies (Argentina, Turkey and Venezuela). Beginning in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024, the
Company also accounted for operations in Egypt as highly inflationary. The translation of balance
sheet accounts for highly inflationary economies are reflected in the operating results.
A rollforward of the changes during fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022 for foreign currency translation
adjustments is included in Note 13.

 calculation excluded the following 
 number of shares related to stock 54.1 43.0 0.0 
 options, as the exercise price of these 
 options was greater than the average 
 market value of the Company’s stock. 
16. Common stock, stock option plans and stock compensation agreements
At December 29, 2024, the Company had oneactive stock-based compensation plan, the 2022 Long-Term
Incentive Plan. The shares outstanding are for contracts under the Company's 2012 Long-Term Incentive
Plan and 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan. The 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan expired on April 26, 2022.
All awards (stock options, restricted shares units and performance share units) granted subsequent to
that date were under the 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan. Under the 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan, the
Company may issue up to 150million shares of common stock, of which up to 110million shares of common
stock may be issued subject to stock options or stock appreciation rights and up to 40million shares
of common stock may be issued subject to full value awards. Awards will generally be counted on a
1-for-1 basis against the share reserve, provided that if more than 40million full value awards are
granted, each full value award in excess of 40million will be counted on a 5-for-1 basis against the
share reserve. Shares available for future grants under the 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan were
111million at the end of fiscal year 2024.
The compensation cost that has been charged against income for these plans was $ 1,176million, $
1,087million and $ 1,028million for fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The total income
tax benefit recognized in the income statement for share-based compensation costs was $ 251million, $
221million and $ 177million for fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company also
recognized additional income tax benefits of $ 94million, $ 126million and $ 267million for fiscal
years 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, for which options were exercised or restricted shares were
vested. The total unrecognized compensation cost was $ 1,002million, $ 907million and $ 866million
for fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The weighted average period for this cost to be
recognized was 1.81years, 1.80years and 1.80years for fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022,
respectively. Share-based compensation costs capitalized as part of inventory were insignificant in
all periods.
The Company settles employee benefit equity issuances with treasury shares. Treasury shares are
replenished through market purchases throughout the year for the number of shares used to settle
employee benefit equity issuances.
 2024 Annual Report79 
Stock options
Stock options expire 10years from the date of grant and vest over service periods that range from
6months to 4years. Options granted under the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan were granted at the
average of the high and low prices of the Company’s Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on
the date of grant. Options granted under the 2022 Long-Term incentive Plan were granted at the
closing price of the Company’s Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of grant.
The fair value of each option award was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option
valuation model that uses the assumptions noted in the following table. For 2024, 2023, and 2022
grants, expected volatility represents a blended rate of 10-year weekly historical overall volatility
rate, and a 5-week average implied volatility rate based on at-the-money traded Johnson & Johnson
options with a life of 2 years. For all grants, historical data is used to determine the expected
life of the option. The risk-free rate was based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the
time of grant.
The average fair value of options granted was $ 27.67, $ 27.85and $ 23.23, in fiscal years 2024, 2023
and 2022, respectively. The fair value was estimated based on the weighted average assumptions of:
 2024 2023 2022 
 Risk-free rate 4.15 % 3.74 % 1.98 % 
 Expected volatility 17.85 % 17.69 % 18.00 % 
 Expected life (in years) 7.0 7.0 7.0 
 Expected dividend yield 3.10 % 2.90 % 2.70 %

Restricted share units and performance share units
The Company grants restricted share units which vest over service periods that range from 6months to
3years. The Company also grants performance share units, which are paid in shares of Johnson &
Johnson Common Stock after the end of a three-yearperformance period. Performance shares were granted
with two equally-weighted goals that directly align with or help drive long-term total shareholder
return: adjusted operational earnings per share and relative total shareholder return. The number of
shares actually earned at the end of the three-yearperiod will vary, based only on actual
performance, from 0% to 200% of the target number of performance share units granted.
A summary of the restricted share units and performance share units activity under the Plans as of
December 29, 2024 is presented below:
 (Shares in Thousands) Outstanding Outstanding 
 Restricted Share Units Performance Share Units 
 Shares at December 31, 2023 12,938 2,037

 Issued -5,454 -808 
 Canceled/forfeited/adjusted -774 -122 
 Shares at December 29, 2024 13,041 2,013 
The average fair value of the restricted share units granted was $ 147.51, $ 152.63and $ 153.67in
fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, using the fair market value at the date of grant. The
fair value of restricted share units was discounted for dividends, which are not paid on the
restricted share units during the vesting period. The fair value of restricted share units issued was
$ 833million, $ 605million and $ 591million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
The weighted average fair value of the performance share units granted was $ 133.76, $ 145.17and $
170.46in fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022, calculated using the weighted average fair market value
for each of the component goals at the date of grant.
The fair values for the earnings per share goals of each performance share unit were estimated on the
date of grant using the fair market value of the shares at the time of the award discounted for
dividends, which are not paid on the performance share units during the vesting period. The fair
value for the relative total shareholder return goal of each performance share unit was estimated on
the date of grant using the Monte Carlo valuation model. The fair value of performance share units
issued was $ 146million, $ 140million and $ 94million in fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022,
respectively.
 2024 Annual Report81 
 17. Segments of business and geographic areas 
Following the separation of the Consumer Health business in the fiscal third quarter of 2023, the
Company is now organized into tworeportable segments: Innovative Medicine and MedTech. The segment
results have been recast for all periods to reflect the continuing operations of the Company.
The Company’s chief operating decision maker (CODM) is the Chief Executive Officer (Principal
Executive Officer). For the Innovative Medicine and MedTech segments, the CODM uses segment income
before tax to allocate resources (including employees, financial, and capital resources) for each
segment predominantly in the annual forecasting process. The CODM considers planning-to-actual
variances on a quarterly basis to assess performance and make decisions about allocating resources to
the segments.

 2024 Annual Report89 
 18. Acquisitions and divestitures 
Subsequent to the fiscal year end 2024, the Company announced it has entered into a definitive
agreement to acquire Intra-Cellular Therapies, Inc. (Nasdaq: ITCI), a biopharmaceutical company
focused on the development and commercialization of therapeutics for central nervous system (CNS)
disorders, for $ 132.00per share in cash for a total equity value of approximately $ 14.6billion. The
Company expects to fund the transaction through a combination of cash on hand and debt. The closing
of the transaction is expected to occur later this year subject to applicable regulatory approvals,
approval by Intra-Cellular Therapies’ stockholders and other customary closing conditions for a
transaction of this type. The results of operations will be included in the Innovative Medicine
segment beginning on the acquisition date.
Business combinations
Acquisitions of a business are accounted for as business combinations applying the acquisition method
of accounting. Under this method, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their
respective fair values as of the acquisition date in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets, where applicable, is
recorded as goodwill. The results of operations of these acquisitions have been included in the
Company’s financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition.
During the fiscal year 2024, certain businesses were acquired for $ 15.1billion, net of cash
acquired. The fiscal year 2024 acquisitions primarily included; Ambrx Biopharma, Inc., Shockwave
Medical Inc., and Proteologix, Inc. The remaining acquisitions were not material.
On June 20, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of Proteologix, Inc., a privately held
biotechnology company focused on bispecific antibodies for immune-mediated diseases, for
approximately $ 0.8billion net of cash acquired, with potential for an additional milestone payment.
The results of operations are included in the Innovative Medicine segment as of the acquisition date.
The fair value of the acquisition was allocated to assets acquired of $ 1.2billion, primarily non-
amortizable intangible assets, inclusive of purchased IPR&D, for $ 0.9billion, goodwill for $
0.3billion, and $ 0.3billion of liabilities assumed which included $ 0.1billion related to a
contingent consideration. The preliminary purchase price allocation is subject to any subsequent
valuation adjustments within the measurement period. A probability of success factor ranging from 30%
to 45% was used in the fair value calculation to reflect inherent regulatory and commercial risk of
the IPR&D. The discount rate applied was approximately 16%. The goodwill is primarily attributable to
synergies expected to arise from the business acquisition and is not expected to be deductible for
tax purposes. Acquisition related costs before tax for the fiscal 2024 were notmaterial.
On May 31, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of Shockwave Medical Inc. (SWAV)(Shockwave), a
leading, first-to-market provider of innovative intravascular lithotripsy (IVL) technology for the
treatment of calcified coronary artery disease (CAD) and peripheral artery disease (PAD) in an all-
cash merger transaction. The Company acquired all the outstanding shares of Shockwave’s common stock
for $ 335.00per share through a merger of Shockwave with a subsidiary of the Company. The results of
operations were included in the MedTech segment as of the acquisition date.
 90 
Details of the fair value amounts recognized for assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the
purchase date and at the end of fiscal year 2024, which includes measurement period adjustments, are
included in the table below. As the acquisition occurred in May 2024, the Company is still finalizing
the allocation of the purchase price to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The
allocation of the purchase price included in the current period balance sheet is based on the best
estimate of management and is preliminary and subject to change.

The goodwill is primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise from the business acquisition
and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Acquisition related costs before tax for the
fiscal 2024 were $ 0.9billion of which $ 0.4billion was related to the fair value of the inventory
step-up and was recorded in Cost of products sold and $ 0.5billion primarily related to equity awards
and was recorded in Other (income) expense. The amortizable intangible assets were primarily
comprised of already in-market CAD and PAD IVL products with the average weighted lives of 14years.
The IPR&D assets were valued for technology programs for unapproved products. The value of the IPR&D
was calculated using a probability-adjusted cash flow projection discounted for the risk inherent in
such projects with the weighted average probability of success factors of approximately 50%. The
discount rate applied was 9.0%.
On March 7, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of Ambrx Biopharma, Inc., (Ambrx), a
clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company with a proprietary synthetic biology technology platform to
design and develop next-generation antibody drug conjugates (ADCs), in an all-cash merger transaction
for a total equity value of approximately $ 2.0billion, or $ 1.8billion net of cash acquired. The
Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of Ambrx’s common stock for $ 28.00per share through a
merger of Ambrx with a subsidiary of the Company. The results of operations were included in the
Innovative Medicine segment as of the acquisition date. The fair value of the acquisition was
allocated to assets acquired of $ 2.3billion, primarily non-amortizable intangible assets, inclusive
of purchased IPR&D, for $ 1.9billion, goodwill for $ 0.3billion and liabilities assumed of $
0.5billion, which includes deferred taxes of $ 0.4billion. The preliminary purchase price allocation
is subject to any subsequent valuation adjustments within the measurement period. A probability of
success factor ranging from 40% to
 2024 Annual Report91 
70% was used in the fair value calculation to reflect inherent regulatory and commercial risk of the
IPR&D. The discount rate applied was approximately 17%. The goodwill is primarily attributable to
synergies expected to arise from the business acquisition and is not expected to be deductible for
tax purposes. Acquisition related costs before tax for the fiscal year 2024 were not material.
During the fiscal year 2023, the Company did not make any acquisitions that qualified as a business
combination.
During the fiscal year 2022, certain businesses were acquired for $ 17.7billion, net of cash
acquired. The fiscal year 2022 acquisitions primarily included Abiomed, Inc. (Abiomed). The remaining
acquisitions were not material.
On December 22, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of Abiomed, a leading, first-to-market
provider of cardiovascular medical technology with a first-in-kind portfolio for the treatment of
coronary artery disease and heart failure which also has an extensive innovation pipeline of life-
saving technologies. The transaction broadens the Company’s position as a growing cardiovascular
innovator, advancing the standard of care in heart failure and recovery, one of healthcare’s largest
areas of unmet need. The results of operations were included in the MedTech segment as of the date of
the acquisition. The acquisition was completed through a tender offer for all outstanding shares. The
consideration paid in the acquisition consisted of an upfront payment of $ 380.00per share in cash,
amounting to $ 17.1billion, net of cash acquired, as well as a non-tradeable contingent value right
(“CVR”) entitling the holder to receive up to $ 35.00per share in cash (which with respect to the
CVRs total approximately $ 1.6billion in the aggregate) if certain commercial and clinical milestones
are achieved. The corresponding enterprise value (without taking into account the CVRs) of
approximately $ 16.5billion includes cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities acquired.
The milestones of the CVR consist of:
a. $ 17.50per share, payable if net sales for Abiomed products exceeds $ 3.7billion during Johnson &
Johnson’s fiscal second quarter of 2027 through fiscal first quarter of 2028, or if this threshold is
not met during this period and is subsequently met during any rolling four quarter period up to the
end of Johnson & Johnson’s fiscal first quarter of 2029, $ 8.75per share;
b. $ 7.50per share payable upon FDA premarket application approval of the use of Impella® products in
ST-elevated myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients without cardiogenic shock by January 1, 2028; and
c. $ 10.00per share payable upon the first publication of a Class I recommendation for the use of
Impella® products in high risk PCI or STEMI with or without cardiogenic shock within four years from
their respective clinical endpoint publication dates, but in all cases no later than December 31,
2029.
During the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023, the Company finalized the purchase price allocation. In
fiscal 2023, there were purchase price allocation adjustments netting to approximately $ 0.2billion
with an offsetting increase to goodwill. The fair value of the acquisition was allocated to assets
acquired of $ 20.1billion (net of $ 0.3billion cash acquired), primarily to goodwill for $
11.1billion, amortizable intangible assets for $ 6.6billion, IPR&D for $ 1.1billion, marketable
securities of $ 0.6billion and liabilities assumed of $ 3.0billion, which includes the fair value of
the contingent consideration mentioned above for $ 0.7billion and deferred taxes of $ 2.0billion. The
goodwill is primarily attributable to the commercial acceleration and expansion of the portfolio and
is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The contingent consideration was recorded in Other
Liabilities and adjusted to fair value through the fiscal year end 2024 on the Consolidated Balance
Sheet.
The amortizable intangible assets were primarily comprised of already in-market products of the
Impella® platform with an average weighted life of 14years. The IPR&D assets were valued for
technology programs for unapproved products. The value of the IPR&D was calculated using probability-
adjusted cash flow projections discounted for the risk inherent in such projects. The probability of
success factor ranged from 52% to 70%. The discount rate applied was 9.5%.
In the fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded acquisition related costs before tax of
approximately $ 0.3billion, $ 0.2billion and $ 0.3billion, which was primarily recorded in Other
(income)/expense.
In accordance with U.S. GAAP standards related to business combinations, and goodwill and other
intangible assets, supplemental pro forma information for fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022 is not
provided, as the impact of the aforementioned acquisitions did not have a material effect on the
Company’s results of operations.

Asset acquisitions
Acquired In-process research and development (IPR&D) in an asset acquisition is immediately expensed
as research and development expense in the Company's consolidated financial statements. Milestone
payments incurred prior to regulatory approval are expensed as research and development expense when
the milestone event occurs.
The fiscal year 2024 asset acquisitions expensed as research and development included V-Wave Ltd. and
the global rights to the NM26 bispecific antibody (Yellow Jersey acquisition). The remaining activity
was not material.
On October 8, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of V-Wave Ltd, a privately-held company
focused on developing innovative treatment options for patients with heart failure, for an upfront
payment of $ 0.6billion, with the potential for additional regulatory and commercial milestone
payments up to approximately $ 1.1billion. The Company recorded an IPR&D charge of approximately $
0.5billion, net of a gain recorded on the Company's existing investment in V-Wave and the results of
operations are included in the MedTech segment as of the acquisition date.
On July 11, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of Yellow Jersey, a demerged subsidiary of
Numab Therapeutics AG, to secure the global rights to NM26, a novel, investigational first-in-class
bispecific antibody targeting two clinically proven pathways in atopic dermatitis (AD), in an all-
cash transaction for approximately $ 1.25billion. The Company recorded an IPR&D charge of
approximately $ 1.25billion, and the results of operations are included in the Innovative Medicine
segment as of the acquisition date.
The fiscal year 2023 asset acquisitions expensed as research and development included Laminar Inc.
The remaining activity was not material.
During the fiscal year 2023, the Company completed the acquisition of Laminar Inc., a privately-held
medical device company focused on eliminating the left atrial appendage (LAA) in patients with non-
valvular atrial fibrillation (AFib), for an upfront payment of $ 0.4billion. The Company recorded an
IPR&D charge of approximately $ 0.4billion and the results of operations are included in the MedTech
segment as of the acquisition date.
There were no significant asset acquisitions in 2022.
Divestitures
During the fiscal year 2024, the Company completed the divestiture of Acclarent resulting in
approximately $ 0.3billion in proceeds and the divestiture of Ponvory outside of the U.S. resulting
in approximately $ 0.2billion in proceeds. All other divestitures were not material.
During the fiscal year 2023, the Company executed divestitures resulting in approximately $
0.2billion in proceeds resulting in gains or losses that were not material. At fiscal year end 2023,
the Company held assets, primarily intangibles, on its Consolidated Balance Sheet of approximately $
0.3billion, primarily related to Acclarent and Ponvory, that were subsequently divested in fiscal
2024.
During fiscal year 2022, the Company did notmake any material divestitures.
 19. Legal proceedings 
Johnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims
regarding product liability; intellectual property; commercial; indemnification and other matters;
governmental investigations; and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary
course of their business.
The Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is
probable that a liability will be incurred, and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
As of December 29, 2024, the Company has determined that the liabilities associated with certain
litigation matters are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for these
matters and will continue to monitor each related legal issue and adjust accruals as might be
warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance with ASC 450-20-25. For
these and other litigation and regulatory matters discussed below for which a loss is probable or
reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the
amounts accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of
judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions
including timing of related payments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be
affected by various factors including, among other things, whether damages sought in the proceedings
are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or is not
complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant
facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and unpredictability of the
number of
 2024 Annual Report93 
potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party settlements; complexity of related
cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. To the extent adverse
awards, judgments or verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an
accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated.
In the Company’s opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and
discussions with counsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in
the Company’s balance sheet, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
financial position. However, the resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these
matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of
operations and cash flows for that period.
Matters concerning talc
A significant number of personal injury claims alleging that talc causes cancer have been asserted
against the Company and its affiliates arising out of the use of body powders containing talc,
primarily JOHNSON’S Baby Powder.
In talc cases that have gone to trial, the Company has obtained a number of defense verdicts, but
there also have been verdicts against the Company, many of which have been reversed on appeal. In
June 2020, the Missouri Court of Appeals reversed in part and affirmed in part a July 2018 verdict of
$ 4.7billion in Ingham v. Johnson & Johnson, et al., No. ED 207476 (Mo. App.), reducing the overall
award to $ 2.1billion. An application for transfer of the case to the Missouri Supreme Court was
subsequently denied, and in June 2021, a petition for certiorari, seeking a review of the Ingham
decision by the United States Supreme Court, was denied. In June 2021, the Company paid the award,
which, including interest, totaled approximately $ 2.5billion. The facts and circumstances, including
the terms of the award, were unique to the Ingham decision and not representative of other claims
brought against the Company. The Company continues to believe that it has strong legal grounds to
contest the other talc verdicts that it has appealed. Notwithstanding the Company’s confidence in the
safety of its talc products, in certain circumstances the Company has settled cases.
In June 2014, the Mississippi Attorney General filed a complaint against the Company alleging
violation of the Mississippi Consumer Protection Act by failing to disclose alleged health risks
associated with female consumers’ use of talc contained in JOHNSON’S Baby Powder and JOHNSON’S Shower
to Shower (a product divested in 2012). The Company has reached an agreement to resolve this matter.
In January 2020, the State of New Mexico filed a consumer protection case alleging that the Company
deceptively marketed and sold its talcum powder products by making misrepresentations about the
safety of the products and the presence of carcinogens, including asbestos. The Company has reached
an agreement to resolve this matter.
Forty-two states and the District of Columbia commenced a joint investigation into the Company’s
marketing of its talcum powder products. In January 2024, the Company reached an agreement in
principle with the multi-state group of state Attorneys General, subject to ongoing negotiation of
non-monetary terms. In June 2024, the settlements were finalized.
In October 2021, Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc. (Old JJCI) implemented a corporate restructuring
(the 2021 Corporate Restructuring). As a result of that restructuring, Old JJCI ceased to exist and
three new entities were created: (a) LTL Management LLC, a North Carolina limited liability company
(LTL or Debtor); (b) Royalty A&M LLC, a North Carolina limited liability company and a direct
subsidiary of LTL (RAM); and (c) the Debtor’s direct parent, Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc., a New
Jersey company (New JJCI). The Debtor received certain of Old JJCI’s assets and became solely
responsible for the talc-related liabilities of Old JJCI, including all liabilities related in any
way to injury or damage, or alleged injury or damage, sustained or incurred in the purchase or use
of, or exposure to, talc, including talc contained in any product, or to the risk of, or
responsibility for, any such damage or injury, except for any liabilities for which the exclusive
remedy is provided under a workers’ compensation statute or act (the Talc-Related Liabilities).
In October 2021, notwithstanding the Company’s confidence in the safety of its talc products, the
Debtor filed a voluntary petition with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of
North Carolina, Charlotte Division, seeking relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (the LTL
Bankruptcy Case). All litigation against LTL, Old JJCI, New JJCI, the Company, other of their
corporate affiliates, identified retailers, insurance companies, and certain other parties (the
Protected Parties) was stayed. The LTL Bankruptcy Case was transferred to the United States
Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey. Claimants filed motions to dismiss the LTL
Bankruptcy Case and, following a multiple day hearing, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court denied those
motions in March 2022.
The claimants subsequently filed notices of appeal as to the denial of the motions to dismiss the LTL
Bankruptcy Case and the extension of the stay to the Protected Parties. On January 30, 2023, the
Third Circuit reversed the Bankruptcy Court’s ruling and remanded to the Bankruptcy Court to dismiss
the LTL bankruptcy.
 94 
In April 2023, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court dismissed the LTL Bankruptcy Case, effectively lifting
the stay as to all parties and returning the talc litigation to the tort system. LTL re-filed in the
United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey seeking relief under Chapter 11 of the
Bankruptcy Code (the LTL 2 Bankruptcy Case). As a result of the new filing, all talc claims against
LTL were again automatically stayed pursuant to section 362 of the Bankruptcy Code. Additionally, the
New Jersey Bankruptcy Court issued a temporary restraining order staying all litigation as to LTL,
Old JJCI, New JJCI, the Company, identified retailers, and certain other parties (the New Protected
Parties).
Also in April 2023, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court issued a decision that granted limited injunctive
relief to the Company and the New Protected Parties (the LTL 2 Preliminary Injunction). The LTL 2
Preliminary Injunction remained in force until late August 2023, following the Bankruptcy Court’s
extension of the initial LTL 2 Preliminary Injunction in June 2023. Under the LTL 2 Preliminary
Injunction, except for those cases filed in the federal court ovarian cancer multi-district
litigation, discovery in all personal injury and wrongful death matters was permitted to proceed.
Furthermore, in April 2023, the Talc Claimants' Committee filed a motion to dismiss the LTL 2
Bankruptcy followed by similar motions from other claimants. Hearings on the motions to dismiss
occurred in June 2023. In July 2023, the court dismissed the LTL 2 Bankruptcy case and, the same day,
the Company stated its intent to appeal the decision and to continue its efforts to obtain a
resolution of the talc claims. In September 2023, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order granting LTL
leave to seek a direct appeal to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. In October 2023, the Third
Circuit granted LTL’s petition for a direct appeal. In July 2024, the Third Circuit issued a non-
precedential opinion affirming the Bankruptcy Court's decision to dismiss the LTL Bankruptcy case.
In October 2023, the Company stated that it was pursuing the following four parallel and alternative
pathways to achieve a comprehensive and final resolution of the talc claims: (i) the appeal of the
LTL 2 dismissal decision; (ii) pursuing a consensual “prepackaged” bankruptcy case, as “strongly
encouraged” by the Bankruptcy Court in its dismissal decision; (iii) aggressively litigating the talc
claims in the tort system; and (iv) pursuing affirmative claims against experts for false and
defamatory narratives regarding the Company’s talc powder products. In December 2023, LTL changed its
state of formation to Texas and its name to LLT Management LLC ("LLT").
Following the dismissal of LTL 2, new lawsuits were filed, cases across the country that had been
stayed were reactivated, and trials have commenced. The majority of the cases are pending in federal
court, organized in a multi-district litigation (MDL) in the United States District Court for the
District of New Jersey. In the MDL, case-specific discovery proceeded. The MDL proceedings have been
stayed by order of the bankruptcy court in the Red River Bankruptcy case discussed below. In March
2024, the court granted the Company's motion for a renewed Daubert hearing prior to the trial. The
briefing on the renewed Daubert issues was completed in August 2024.
In May 2024, the Company commenced a three-monthsolicitation period of its proposed consensual
“prepackaged” Chapter 11 bankruptcy plan (the “Proposed Plan”) for the comprehensive and final
resolution of all current and future claims related to cosmetic talc in the United States, excluding
claims related to mesothelioma or State consumer protection claims, in exchange for the payment by
the Company of present value of approximately $ 6.475billion payable over 25years (nominal value of
approximately $ 8.0billion, discounted at a rate of 4.4%). The claims encompassed by the Proposed
Plan constitute 99.75% of pending lawsuits against the Company relating to its talc powder products.
In August 2024, LLT engaged in a restructuring that resulted in the creation of three new Texas
limited liability companies: (a) Red River Talc, LLC ("Red River"); (b) Pecos River Talc LLC ("Pecos
River"); and (3) New Holdco (Texas) LLC. As a result of this restructuring, all claims related to
ovarian and other gynecological cancers were separated and allocated to Red River, and mesothelioma,
governmental unit and certain other claims were allocated to Pecos River.
In September 2024, while reiterating the Company's continued confidence in the safety of its talc
products, Red River filed a voluntary petition with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the
Southern District of Texas, seeking relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (the Red River
Bankruptcy Case), in furtherance of the Company's consensual "prepackaged" Proposed Plan. Red River
also filed a motion for a temporary restraining order, seeking to extend the automatic stay to
additional non-debtor entities. Prior to filing, the initial proposed plan was amended to, among
other things, increase the proposed resolution by $ 1.75billion.
 2024 Annual Report95 
Shortly after Red River filed its Chapter 11 petition, the U.S. Trustee's office filed a motion to
transfer venue in the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court, and thereafter, a motion to transfer venue and a
motion to dismiss in the Texas Bankruptcy Court. A coalition of six plaintiff law firms also filed a
motion to transfer venue and a motion to dismiss in the Texas Bankruptcy Court. In September 2024,
the Texas Bankruptcy Court entered a temporary order enjoining the commencement or prosecution of all
claims against Red River and certain non-debtor entities, including the Company, until October 11,
2024. The temporary order was extended in October 2024 and again in December 2024. The commencement
and prosecution of all claims against Red River and certain non-debtor entities are currently
enjoined until March 15, 2025. Also in September 2024, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court denied the
U.S. Trustee's motion to transfer venue without prejudice. In October 2024, the Texas Bankruptcy
Court denied the motion to transfer venue from Texas to New Jersey Bankruptcy Court. A consolidated
hearing to address, among other things, the motions to dismiss and plan confirmation is currently
scheduled to begin on February 18, 2025.
Mesothelioma and State consumer protection claims are being addressed outside the Proposed Plan. The
Company separately has resolved 95% of the mesothelioma lawsuits filed to date and has resolved the
State claims.
To account for these settlements and the contemplated comprehensive resolution through the Proposed
Plan, the Company recorded a cumulative incremental charge of approximately $ 5.0billion, through the
fourth fiscal quarter 2024. As of December 29, 2024, the total present value of the reserve is
approximately $ 11.6billion (or nominal value of approximately $ 13.5billion), net of payments made
in fiscal 2024. Approximately ten percent of the reserve is recorded as a current liability. The
recorded amount remains the Company's best estimate of probable loss.
In February 2019, the Company’s talc supplier, Imerys Talc America, Inc. and two of its affiliates,
Imerys Talc Vermont, Inc. and Imerys Talc Canada, Inc. (collectively, Imerys) filed a voluntary
petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Code (the Bankruptcy Code) in the United
States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (Imerys Bankruptcy). The Imerys Bankruptcy
relates to Imerys’s potential liability for personal injury from exposure to talcum powder sold by
Imerys. In its bankruptcy, Imerys alleges it has claims against the Company for indemnification and
rights to joint insurance proceeds. In its bankruptcy, Imerys proposed a Chapter 11 plan (the Imerys
Plan) that contemplated all talc-related claims against it being channeled to a trust along with its
alleged indemnification rights against the Company. Following confirmation and consummation of the
plan, the trust would pay talc claims pursuant to proposed trust distribution procedures (the TDP)
and then seek indemnification from the Company.
In February 2021, Cyprus Mines Corporation (Cyprus), which had owned certain Imerys talc mines, filed
a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code and filed its Disclosure
Statement and Plan (the Cyprus Plan). The Cyprus Plan contemplates a settlement with Imerys and talc
claimants where Cyprus would make a monetary contribution to a trust established under the Imerys
Plan in exchange for an injunction against talc claims asserted against it and certain affiliated
parties. Cyprus also asserts it has claims for indemnity against the Company arising out of talc
personal injury claims. Under the Cyprus Plan, Cyprus would also contribute its alleged
indemnification rights to the trust.
In September 2023, Imerys and Cyprus filed amended plans of reorganization. The amended plans
contemplate a similar construct as the prior Imerys and Cyprus Plans, including all talc claims
against Imerys and Cyprus (and certain other protected parties) being channeled to a trust along with
Imerys’s and Cyprus’s alleged indemnification rights against the Company. The Company opposed both
plans on the basis that the plans inflated Imerys’s and Cyprus’s liability for talc claims and had
the potential effect of imposing those inflated liabilities on the Company through the Company’s
alleged indemnification obligations.
In July 2024, the Company, Imerys, and Cyprus and certain of their affiliates (including their parent
entities), and the tort claimants' committees and future claimants' representatives appointed in
their respective Chapter 11 cases entered into a global settlement agreement (the Imerys Settlement
Agreement) to resolve their ongoing disputes, including disputes raised in the Imerys and Cyprus
bankruptcies. In August 2024, Imerys and Cyprus filed amended Chapter 11 plans and disclosure
statements incorporating the terms of the settlement with the Company. In October 2024, the Imerys
Bankruptcy Court entered an order approving the Imerys Settlement Agreement (the Settlement Order).
The effectiveness of certain provisions of the settlement, including mutual releases, are subject to
certain conditions, including the Imerys and Cyprus Plans being accepted by a sufficient number and
amount of voting creditors to be confirmed under the Bankruptcy Code. Certain insurers have appealed
the Settlement Order and sought a stay of the order pending appeal, which the Court denied on January
13, 2025. The briefing of the appeal in the District Court is scheduled to be completed in April
2025. On January 5, 2025, Imerys and Cyprus each filed a certification of voting results, indicating
that their respective plan had been accepted by each voting class of creditors. A joint confirmation
hearing for the plans is scheduled for April 2025.
 96 
In February 2018, a securities class action lawsuit was filed against the Company and certain named
officers in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging that the
Company violated the federal securities laws by failing to disclose alleged asbestos contamination in
body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON’S Baby Powder, and that purchasers of the Company’s
shares suffered losses as a result. In April 2019, the Company moved to dismiss the complaint. In
December 2019, the Court denied, in part, the motion to dismiss. The case was stayed in May 2022
pursuant to the LTL Bankruptcy Case and was reopened in May 2023. In December 2023, the Court granted
Plaintiff’s motion for class certification. In January 2024, Defendants filed a petition with the
Third Circuit under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(f) for permission to appeal the Court’s order
granting class certification, and in February 2024, the Third Circuit granted Defendants' petition.
In February 2024, fact discovery closed, the Court ordered the parties to mediate, and stayed the
case pending mediation. In May 2024, the parties participated in an unsuccessful mediation. In June
2024, at the parties' request, the Court lifted the stay for certain limited discovery, but otherwise
kept the stay in place pending a decision from the Third Circuit on the 23(f) petition. Briefing on
the 23(f) petition was completed in September 2024. In January 2025, the Third Circuit listed the
appeal for oral argument in March 2025.
Matters concerning opioids
Beginning in 2014 and continuing to the present, the Company and Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI),
along with other pharmaceutical companies, have been named in close to 3,500lawsuits related to the
marketing of opioids, including DURAGESIC, NUCYNTA and NUCYNTA ER. Similar lawsuits have also been
filed by private plaintiffs and organizations, including but not limited to the following: individual
plaintiffs on behalf of children born with Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS); hospitals; and health
insurers/payors.
To date, the Company and JPI have litigated two of the cases to judgment and have prevailed in both,
either at trial or on appeal.
In July 2021, the Company announced finalization of an agreement to settle the state and subdivision
claims for up to $ 5.0billion. Approximately 70% of the all-in settlement was paid by the end of
fiscal fourth quarter 2024. A few government entities opted out of the settlement. In September 2024,
the Company reached an agreement to resolve the hospital cases.
The Company and JPI continue to defend the cases brought by the remaining government entity litigants
as well as the cases brought by private litigants. In total, there are approximately 35 remaining
opioid cases against the Company and JPI in various state courts, 390 remaining cases in the Ohio
multi-district litigation (MDL), and 4 additional cases in other federal courts.
In addition, the Province of British Columbia filed suit against the Company and its Canadian
affiliate Janssen Inc., and many other industry members, in Canada. That action was certified as an
opt in class action on behalf of other provincial/territorial and the federal governments in Canada
in January 2025. Additional proposed class actions have been filed in Canada against the Company and
Janssen Inc., and many other industry members, by and on behalf of people who used opioids (for
personal injuries), municipalities and First Nations bands. The proposed class action in Quebec on
behalf of residents diagnosed with opioid use disorder was authorized to proceed against Janssen Inc.
and other industry members in April 2024; and leave to appeal was denied in October 2024.
Starting in November 2019, a series of shareholder derivative complaints were filed against the
Company as the nominal defendant and certain current and former directors and officers as defendants
in the Superior Court of New Jersey. The complaint alleges breaches of fiduciary duties related to
the marketing of opioids, and that the Company has suffered damages as a result of those alleged
breaches. As of September 2024, all the complaints had been dismissed, and all appeals exhausted.
Product liability
The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in numerous product liability claims and
lawsuits involving multiple products. Claimants in these cases seek substantial compensatory and,
where available, punitive damages. While the Company believes it has substantial defenses, it is not
feasible to predict the ultimate outcome of litigation. From time to time, even if it has substantial
defenses, the Company considers isolated settlements based on a variety of circumstances. The Company
has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal issue and adjust
accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance with
ASC 450-20-25, Contingencies. The Company accrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to
defend each matter when those costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. For certain of
these matters, the Company has accrued additional amounts such as estimated costs associated with
settlements, damages and other losses. Product liability accruals can represent projected product
liability for thousands of claims around the world, each in different litigation environments and
with different fact patterns. Changes to the accruals may be required in the future as additional
information becomes available.
 2024 Annual Report97 
The table below contains the most significant of these cases and provides the approximate number of
plaintiffs in the United States with direct claims in pending lawsuits regarding injuries allegedly
due to the relevant product or product category as of December 29, 2024:
 Product or product category Number of plaintiffs 
 Body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON’S 62,830 
 Baby Powder 
 DePuy ASR XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR Hip 60 
 Resurfacing System 
 PINNACLE Acetabular Cup System 910 
 Pelvic meshes 5,990 
 ETHICON PHYSIOMESH Flexible Composite Mesh 130 
 RISPERDAL 7 
 ELMIRON 2,170 
The number of pending lawsuits is expected to fluctuate as certain lawsuits are settled or dismissed
and additional lawsuits are filed. There may be additional claims that have not yet been filed.
MedTech
DePuy ASR XL Acetabular System and ASR Hip Resurfacing System
In August 2010, DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. (DePuy) announced a worldwide voluntary recall of its ASR XL
Acetabular System and DePuy ASR Hip Resurfacing System (ASR Hip) used in hip replacement surgery.
Claims for personal injury have been made against DePuy and the Company. Cases filed in federal
courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States
District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. Litigation has also been filed in countries outside
of the United States, primarily in the United Kingdom, Ireland, India and Italy. In November 2013,
DePuy reached an agreement with a Court-appointed committee of lawyers representing ASR Hip
plaintiffs to establish a program to settle claims with eligible ASR Hip patients in the United
States. This settlement program has resolved more than 10,000claims, thereby bringing to resolution
significant ASR Hip litigation activity in the United States. However, lawsuits in the United States
remain, and the settlement program does not address litigation outside of the United States. The
Company continues to receive information with respect to potential additional costs associated with
this recall on a worldwide basis. The Company has established accruals for the costs associated with
the United States settlement program and ASR Hip-related product liability litigation.
DePuy PINNACLE Acetabular Cup System
Claims for personal injury have also been made against DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. and the Company
(collectively, DePuy) relating to the PINNACLE Acetabular Cup System used in hip replacement surgery.
Product liability lawsuits continue to be filed, and the Company continues to receive information
with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. Most cases filed in federal
courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States
District Court for the Northern District of Texas (Texas MDL). Beginning on June 1, 2022, the
Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation ceased transfer of new cases into the Texas MDL, and there
are now cases pending in federal court outside the Texas MDL. Litigation also has been filed in state
courts and in countries outside of the United States. During the first quarter of 2019, DePuy
established a United States settlement program to resolve these cases. As part of the settlement
program, adverse verdicts have been settled. The Company has established an accrual for product
liability litigation associated with the PINNACLE Acetabular Cup System and the related settlement
program.
Ethicon Pelvic Mesh
Claims for personal injury have been made against Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon) and the Company arising out
of Ethicon’s pelvic mesh devices used to treat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse.
The Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and additional cases.
Cases filed in federal courts in the United States had been organized as a multi-district litigation
(MDL) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia. In March 2021,
the MDL Court entered an order closing the MDL. The MDL Court has remanded cases for trial to the
jurisdictions where the case was originally filed and additional pelvic mesh lawsuits have been
filed, and remain, outside of the MDL. The Company has settled or otherwise resolved the majority of
the United States cases and the estimated costs associated with these settlements and the remaining
cases are reflected in the Company’s accruals. In addition, class actions and individual personal
injury cases or claims seeking damages for alleged injury resulting from Ethicon’s pelvic mesh
devices have been commenced in
 98 
various countries outside of the United States, including claims and cases in the United Kingdom, the
Netherlands, and Ireland, and class actions in Israel, Australia, Canada and South Africa. The vast
majority of these actions are now resolved. The Company has established accruals with respect to
product liability litigation associated with Ethicon’s pelvic mesh products.
Ethicon Physiomesh
Following a June 2016 worldwide market withdrawal of Ethicon Physiomesh Flexible Composite Mesh
(Physiomesh), claims for personal injury have been made against Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon) and the
Company alleging personal injury arising out of the use of this hernia mesh device. Cases filed in
federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation (MDL) in the
United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. A multi-county litigation (MCL)
also has been formed in New Jersey state court and assigned to Atlantic County for cases pending in
New Jersey. In addition to the matters in the MDL and MCL, there are additional lawsuits pending in
the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, which are part of the MDL for
polypropylene mesh devices manufactured by C.R. Bard, Inc., and lawsuits pending in two New Jersey
MCLs formed for Proceed/Proceed Ventral Patch and Prolene Hernia systems, and lawsuits pending
outside the United States. In May 2021, Ethicon and lead counsel for the plaintiffs entered into a
term sheet to resolve approximately 3,600Physiomesh cases (covering approximately 4,300plaintiffs)
pending in the MDL and MCL at that time. A master settlement agreement (MSA) was entered into in
September 2021 and includes 3,729cases in the MDL and MCL. Other than a small number of cases still
pending in the MDL, all Physiomesh matters in the United States have been resolved or are undergoing
formal review for purposes of settlement.
Claims have also been filed against Ethicon and the Company alleging personal injuries arising from
the PROCEED Mesh and PROCEED Ventral Patch hernia mesh products. In March 2019, the New Jersey
Supreme Court entered an order consolidating these cases pending in New Jersey as an MCL in Atlantic
County Superior Court. Additional cases have been filed in various federal and state courts in the
United States, and in jurisdictions outside the United States.
Ethicon and the Company also have been subject to claims for personal injuries arising from the
PROLENE Polypropylene Hernia System. In January 2020, the New Jersey Supreme Court created an MCL in
Atlantic County Superior Court to handle such cases. Cases involving this product have also been
filed in other federal and state courts in the United States.
In October 2022, an agreement in principle, subject to various conditions, was reached to settle the
majority of the pending cases involving Proceed, Proceed Ventral Patch, Prolene Hernia System and
related multi-layered mesh products, as well as a number of unfiled claims. All litigation activities
in the two New Jersey MCLs are stayed pending effectuation of the proposed settlement. Future cases
that are filed in the New Jersey MCLs will be subject to docket control orders requiring early expert
reports and discovery requirements.
The Company has established accruals with respect to product liability litigation associated with
Ethicon Physiomesh Flexible Composite Mesh, PROCEED Mesh and PROCEED Ventral Patch, and PROLENE
Polypropylene Hernia System products.
Innovative Medicine
RISPERDAL
Claims for personal injury have been made against Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and the Company
arising out of the use of RISPERDAL, and related compounds, indicated for the treatment of
schizophrenia, acute manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder and irritability
associated with autism. Lawsuits primarily have been filed in state courts in Pennsylvania,
California, and Missouri. Other actions are pending in various courts in the United States and
Canada. The Company continues to defend RISPERDAL product liability lawsuits, and continues to
evaluate potential costs related to those claims. The Company has successfully defended a number of
these cases but there have been verdicts against the Company, including a verdict in October 2019 of
$ 8.0billion of punitive damages related to one plaintiff, which the trial judge reduced to $
6.8million in January 2020. In September 2021, the Company entered into a settlement in principle
with the counsel representing plaintiffs in this matter and in substantially all of the outstanding
cases in the United States. The costs associated with this and other settlements are reflected in the
Company's accruals.
ELMIRON
Claims for personal injury have been made against a number of Johnson & Johnson companies, including
Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and the Company, arising out of the use of ELMIRON, a prescription
medication indicated for the relief of bladder pain or discomfort associated with interstitial
cystitis. These lawsuits, which allege that ELMIRON contributes to the development of permanent
retinal injury and vision loss, have been filed in both state and federal courts across the United
States. In December 2020, lawsuits filed in federal courts in the United States, including putative
class action cases seeking medical monitoring, were organized as a multi-district litigation in the
United States District Court for the District of New
 2024 Annual Report99 
Jersey (MDL). In addition, cases have been filed in various state courts of New Jersey, which have
been coordinated in a multi-county litigation in Bergen County, as well as the Court of Common Pleas
in Philadelphia, which have been coordinated and granted mass tort designation. In addition, three
class action lawsuits have been filed in Canada. The Company continues to defend ELMIRON product
liability lawsuits and continues to evaluate potential costs related to those claims. All U.S. based
ELMIRON matters have been resolved or are undergoing formal review for purposes of settlement. The
Company has established accruals for defense and indemnity costs associated with ELMIRON related
product liability litigation.
Intellectual property
Certain subsidiaries of the Company are subject, from time to time, to legal proceedings and claims
related to patent, trademark and other intellectual property matters arising out of their businesses.
Many of these matters involve challenges to the scope and/or validity of patents that relate to
various products and allegations that certain of the Company’s products infringe the intellectual
property rights of third parties. Although these subsidiaries believe that they have substantial
defenses to these challenges and allegations with respect to all significant patents, there can be no
assurance as to the outcome of these matters. A loss in any of these cases could adversely affect the
ability of these subsidiaries to sell their products, result in loss of sales due to loss of market
exclusivity, require the payment of past damages and future royalties, and may result in a non-cash
impairment charge for any associated intangible asset.
Innovative Medicine - litigation against filers of abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs)
The Company’s subsidiaries have brought lawsuits against generic companies that have filed ANDAs with
the U.S. FDA (or similar lawsuits outside of the United States) seeking to market generic versions of
products sold by various subsidiaries of the Company prior to expiration of the applicable patents
covering those products. These lawsuits typically include allegations of non-infringement and/or
invalidity of patents listed in FDA’s publication “Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic
Equivalence Evaluations” (commonly known as the Orange Book). In each of these lawsuits, the
Company’s subsidiaries are seeking an order enjoining the defendant from marketing a generic version
of a product before the expiration of the relevant patents (Orange Book Listed Patents). In the event
the Company’s subsidiaries are not successful in an action, or any automatic statutory stay expires
before the court rulings are obtained, the generic companies involved would have the ability, upon
regulatory approval, to introduce generic versions of their products to the market, resulting in the
potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for the applicable products, and which may
result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. In addition, from time to
time, the Company’s subsidiaries may settle these types of actions and such settlements can involve
the introduction of generic versions of the products at issue to the market prior to the expiration
of the relevant patents.
The Inter Partes Review (IPR) process with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO),
created under the 2011 America Invents Act, is also being used at times by generic companies in
conjunction with ANDAs and lawsuits to challenge the applicable patents.
XARELTO
Beginning in March 2021, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; Bayer Pharma AG; Bayer AG; and Bayer
Intellectual Property GmbH filed patent infringement lawsuits in United States district courts
against generic manufacturers who have filed ANDAs seeking approval to market generic versions of
XARELTO before expiration of certain Orange Book Listed Patents. The following entities are named
defendants: Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Inc.; Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Ltd.; Lupin Limited; Lupin
Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; Taro Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.; Taro Pharmaceuticals U.S.A., Inc.; Teva
Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc.; Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc.; Mylan Inc.; Mankind Pharma Limited; Apotex
Inc.; Apotex Corp.; Auson Pharmaceuticals Inc.; Shanghai Auson Pharmaceuticals Co. Ltd.; Cipla Ltd.;
Cipla USA Inc.; InvaGen Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; Prinston Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; Ascent
Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; and Hetero Labs Limited. In October 2024, the Company entered into a
confidential settlement agreement with Auson Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Shanghai Auson Pharmaceuticals
Co., Ltd. and the case was dismissed. In November 2024, the Company entered into confidential
settlement agreements with Ascent Pharmaceuticals Inc. that resulted in dismissal of litigation
against Ascent Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Hetero Labs Limited. In January 2025, the Company entered
into a confidential settlement agreement with Prinston Pharmaceutical, Inc. (as to U.S. Patent No.
9,539,218). The following U.S. patents are included in one or more cases: 9,539,218 and 10,828,310.
U.S. Patent No. 10,828,310 was also under consideration by the USPTO in an IPR proceeding. In July
2023, the USPTO issued a final written decision finding the claims of the patent invalid. In
September 2023, Bayer Pharma AG filed an appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
INVEGA SUSTENNA
 100 
Beginning in January 2018, Janssen Pharmaceutica NV and Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. filed patent
infringement lawsuits in United States district courts against generic manufacturers who have filed
ANDAs seeking approval to market generic versions of INVEGA SUSTENNA before expiration of the Orange
Book Listed Patent. The following entities are named defendants: Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc.;
Mylan Laboratories Limited; Pharmascience Inc.; Mallinckrodt PLC; Specgx LLC; Tolmar, Inc.; Accord
Healthcare, Inc.; Qilu Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd.; and Qilu Pharma Inc. The following U.S. patent is
included in one or more cases: 9,439,906. In October 2020, the district court issued a decision in

 20. Restructuring 
In fiscal 2023, the Company commenced restructuring actions within its Innovative Medicine and
MedTech segments. The amounts and details of the current year programs are included below.
In fiscal 2023, the Company completed a prioritization of its research and development (R&D)
investment within its Innovative Medicine segment to focus on the most promising medicines with the
greatest benefit to patients. This resulted in the exit of certain programs within certain
therapeutic areas. The R&D program exits are primarily in infectious diseases and vaccines including
the discontinuation of its respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) adult vaccine program, hepatitis and HIV
development. Pre-tax Restructuring expenses of $ 0.1billion in the fiscal year 2024, included the
termination of partnered and non-partnered development program costs, asset impairments and asset
divestments. Pre-tax Restructuring expenses of $ 0.5billion in the fiscal year 2023, included the
termination of partnered and non-partnered development program costs and asset impairments. Total
project costs of approximately $ 0.6billion have been recorded since the restructuring was announced.
The program was completed in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024.
In fiscal 2023, the Company initiated a restructuring program of its Orthopaedics franchise within
the MedTech segment to streamline operations by exiting certain markets, product lines and
distribution network arrangements. The pre-tax restructuring expense of $ 0.2billion in the fiscal
year 2024 primarily included costs related to market and product exits. The pre-tax restructuring
expense of $ 0.3billion in the fiscal year 2023 primarily included inventory and instrument charges
related to market and product exits. Total project costs of approximately $ 0.5billion have been
recorded since the restructuring was announced. The estimated costs of the total program are between
$ 0.7billion - $ 0.8billion and is expected to be completed by the end of fiscal year 2025.
The following table summarizes the restructuring expenses for the fiscal years 2024 and 2023:
 (Pre-tax Dollars in Millions) 2024 2023 
 Innovative Medicine Segment(1) $102 479 
 MedTech Segment(2) 167 319 
 Total Programs $269 $798 
(1) The fiscal year of 2024 included $ 102million in Restructuring on the Consolidated Statement of
Earnings. The fiscal year of 2023 included $ 449million in Restructuring and $ 30million in Cost of
products sold on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings.
(2) The fiscal year of 2024 included $ 132million in Restructuring and $ 35million in Cost of
products sold on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The fiscal year of 2023 Included $ 40million
in Restructuring and $ 279million in Cost of products sold on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings.
Restructuring reserves as of December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were insignificant.

 21. Kenvue separation and discontinued operations 
The results of the Consumer Health business (previously reported as a separate business segment) have
been reflected as discontinued operations in the Company’s consolidated statements of earnings as Net
earnings from discontinued operations, net of taxes through August 23, 2023, the date of the exchange
offer. Prior periods have been recast to reflect this presentation.
On May 15, 2024, the Company issued $ 3.6billion aggregate principal amount of commercial paper and
received $ 3.6billion of net cash proceeds to be used for general corporate purposes. On May 17,
2024, the Company completed a Debt-for-Equity Exchange of its remaining 182,329,550shares of Kenvue
Common Stock for the outstanding Commercial Paper. Upon completion of the Debt-for-Equity Exchange,
the Commercial Paper was satisfied and discharged and the Company no longer owns any shares of Kenvue
Common Stock. This exchange resulted in a loss of approximately $ 0.4billion recorded in Other
(income) expense.
On May 8, 2023, Kenvue, completed an initial public offering (the IPO) resulting in the issuance of
198,734,444shares of its common stock, par value $ 0.01per share (the “Kenvue Common Stock”), at an
initial public offering of $ 22.00per share for net proceeds of $ 4.2billion. The excess of the net
proceeds from the IPO over the net book value of the Johnson & Johnson divested interest was $
2.5billion and was recorded to additional paid-in capital. As of the closing of the IPO, Johnson &
Johnson owned approximately 89.6% of the total outstanding shares of Kenvue Common Stock and at July
2, 2023, the non-controlling interest of $ 1.3billion associated with Kenvue was reflected in equity
attributable to non-controlling interests in the consolidated balance sheet in the fiscal second
quarter of 2023.
On August 23, 2023, Johnson & Johnson completed the disposition of an additional 80.1% ownership of
Kenvue Common Stock through an exchange offer, which resulted in Johnson & Johnson acquiring
190,955,436shares of the Company’s common stock in exchange for 1,533,830,450shares of Kenvue Common
Stock. The $ 31.4billion of Johnson & Johnson common stock received in the exchange offer is recorded
in Treasury stock. Following the exchange offer, the Company owned 9.5% of the total outstanding
shares of Kenvue Common Stock that was recorded in other assets within continuing operations at the
fair market value of $ 4.3billion as of August 23, 2023. Subsequent changes are reflected in other
income/expense and amounted to $ 0.4billion expense through December 31, 2023.
Johnson & Johnson divested net assets of $ 11.6billion as of August 23, 2023, and the accumulated
other comprehensive loss attributable to the Consumer Health business at that date was $ 4.3billion.
Additionally, at the date of the exchange offer, Johnson & Johnson decreased the non-controlling
interest by $ 1.2billion to record the deconsolidation of Kenvue. This resulted in a non-cash gain on
the exchange offer of $ 21.0billion that was recorded in Net earnings from discontinued operations,
net of taxes in the consolidated statements of earnings for the fiscal third quarter of 2023. This
one-time gain includes a gain of $ 2.8billion on the Kenvue Common Stock retained by Johnson &
Johnson. The gain on the exchange offer qualifies as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income
tax purposes.
Also in connection with the separation, Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue entered into a separation
agreement and also entered into various other agreements that provide for certain transactions to
effect the transfer of the assets and liabilities of the Consumer Health business to Kenvue and to
govern various interim and ongoing relationships between Kenvue and Johnson & Johnson following the
completion of the Kenvue IPO, including transition services agreements (TSAs), transition
manufacturing agreements (TMAs), trademark agreements, intellectual property agreements, an employee
matters agreement, and a tax matters agreement. Under the TSAs, Johnson & Johnson will provide Kenvue
various services and, similarly, Kenvue will provide Johnson & Johnson various services. The
provision of services under the TSAs generally will terminate within 24months following the Kenvue
IPO. Additionally, Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue entered into TMAs pursuant to which Johnson & Johnson
will manufacture and supply to Kenvue certain products and, similarly, Kenvue will manufacture and
supply to Johnson & Johnson certain products. The terms of the TMAs range in initial duration from
3months to 5years.
Amounts related to the TSAs and TMAs included in the consolidated statements of earnings were
immaterial for both fiscal years 2024 and 2023. Additionally, the amounts due to and from Kenvue for
the above agreements was not material as of December 31, 2023.
The results of the Consumer Health business (previously reported as a separate business segment), as
well as the associated gain, have been reflected as discontinued operations in the Company’s
consolidated statements of earnings as Net earnings from discontinued operations, net of taxes. As a
result of the separation of Kenvue, Johnson & Johnson incurred separation costs of $ 145million in
the fiscal year 2024, which was included in Net Earnings and incurred separation costs of $
986million and $ 1,089million in the fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively, which were included in
Net earnings from discontinued operations, net of taxes. These costs were primarily related to
external advisory, legal, accounting, contractor and other
 2024 Annual Report105 
incremental costs directly related to separation activities. In the fiscal 2022, as part of the
planned separation of the Company’s Consumer Health business, the Company recognized approximately $
0.5billion in net incremental tax costs.
Details of Net Earnings from Discontinued Operations, net of taxes are as follows:
 (Dollars in Millions) 2023(1) 2022 
 Sales to customers $10,036 14,953 
 Cost of products sold 4,369 6,494

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Johnson & Johnson
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Johnson & Johnson and its
subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and the related
consolidated statements of earnings, of comprehensive income, of equity and of cash flows for each of
the three fiscal years in the period ended December 29, 2024, including the related notes
(collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the
Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 29, 2024, based on criteria
established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 29, 2024 and December 31,
2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the
period ended December 29, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 29, 2024, based on criteria
established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.
 Basis for Opinions 
The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s report on
internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s
consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting
based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the
Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations
of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated
financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the
risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or
fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on
a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial
statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated
financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for
our opinions.
As described in Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting, management has
excluded Shockwave Medical, Inc., (“Shockwave”) from its assessment of internal control over
financial reporting as of December 29, 2024 because it was acquired by the Company in a purchase
business combination during 2024. We have also excluded Shockwave from our audit of internal control
over financial reporting. Shockwave is a wholly-owned subsidiary whose total assets and total sales
excluded from management’s assessment and our audit of internal control over financial reporting
represent less than 1% of each of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for
the fiscal year ended December 29, 2024.
 2024 Annual Report107 
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and
(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
 Critical Audit Matters 
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of
the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the
audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated
financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.
The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated
financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters
below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to
which they relate.

As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes revenue from
product sales when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied. Rebates
and discounts provided to customers are accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as a
reduction in sales. The liability for such rebates and discounts is recognized within Accrued
rebates, returns, and promotions on the consolidated balance sheet. A significant portion of the
liability related to rebates is from the sale of pharmaceutical products within the U.S., primarily
the Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid programs, which amounted to $12.3 billion as of December 29,
2024. For significant rebate programs, which include the U.S. Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid
rebate programs, rebates and discounts estimated by management are based on contractual terms,
historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis, and projected market conditions in the
various markets served.
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to U.S.
Innovative Medicine rebate reserves - Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid is a critical audit matter
are (i) the significant judgment by management due to the significant measurement uncertainty when
developing the estimate of these reserves and (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity,
and effort in performing procedures and evaluating the assumptions related to contractual terms,
historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis, and projected market conditions in the U.S.
pharmaceutical market.
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with
forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included
testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s estimate of the U.S. Innovative
Medicine rebate reserves - Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid, including controls over the
assumptions used to estimate these rebates. These procedures also included, among others (i)
developing an independent estimate of the rebates by utilizing third party information on price and
market conditions in the U.S. pharmaceutical market, the terms of the specific rebate programs, and
the historical experience and trend analysis of actual rebate claims paid; (ii) testing, on a sample
basis, rebate claims processed by the Company, including evaluating those claims for consistency with
the contractual and mandated terms of the Company’s rebate arrangements; and (iii) comparing the
independent estimates to management’s estimates to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s
estimates.

 Litigation Contingencies – Talc 
As described in Notes 1 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company records accruals
for loss contingencies associated with legal matters, including talc, when it is probable that a
liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. To the extent
adverse awards, judgments, or verdicts have been rendered against the Company, management does not
record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated. For
these matters, management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts
accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments
about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing
of related payments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various
factors, including, among other things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated
or indeterminate; scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings
are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute;
procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and unpredictability of the number of potential
claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party settlements; complexity of related cross-claims
and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. Management continues to believe that
the Company has strong legal grounds to contest the talc verdicts it has appealed. Notwithstanding
management’s confidence in the safety of the Company’s talc products, in certain circumstances the
Company has settled cases. In May 2024, the Company proposed a consensual “prepackaged” Chapter 11
bankruptcy plan (the “Proposed Plan”) for the final resolution of all current and future claims
related to cosmetic talc in the United States, excluding claims related to mesothelioma or State
consumer protection claims. In September 2024, the Company’s subsidiary Red River Talc, LLC filed a
voluntary petition, seeking relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, in furtherance of the
Company’s consensual “prepackaged” Proposed Plan. As of December 29, 2024, the total present value of
the reserve to resolve the talc claims is approximately $11.6 billion, of which approximately ten
percent is recorded as a current liability. The recorded amount remains the Company's best estimate
of probable loss. The Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the
amounts accrued.
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the
litigation contingencies - talc is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by
management when assessing the likelihood of a loss being incurred for the remaining unresolved talc
claims, when determining whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of loss for the remaining
unresolved talc claims can be made, and when determining the timing of settlement payments for the
remaining unresolved talc claims, and (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and
effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to management’s assessment of
the loss contingencies associated with the talc litigation.
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with
forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included
testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s assessment of the litigation
contingencies – talc, including controls over determining whether a loss is probable and whether the
amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, as well as financial statement disclosures. These
procedures also included, among others (i) gaining an understanding of the Company’s process around
the accounting and reporting for the talc litigation; (ii) obtaining and evaluating certain executed
settlement agreements related to the talc litigation; (iii) discussing the status of significant
known actual and potential litigation and settlements activity with the Company’s in-house legal
counsel, as well as external counsel when deemed necessary; (iv) obtaining and evaluating the letters
of audit inquiry with internal and external legal counsel related to the talc litigation; (v)
evaluating the reasonableness of management’s assessment regarding whether an unfavorable outcome is
reasonably possible or probable and reasonably estimable; and (vi) evaluating the sufficiency of the
Company’s litigation contingencies disclosures.

 2024 Annual Report109 
Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting
Under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, management is required to assess the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal
year and report, based on that assessment, whether the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting is effective.
Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control
over financial reporting. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to
provide reasonable assurance as to the reliability of the Company’s financial reporting and the
preparation of external financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles.
Internal controls over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations.
Therefore, internal control over financial reporting determined to be effective can provide only
reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and may not prevent or detect
all misstatements. Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
The Company’s management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 29, 2024. In making this assessment, the Company used the criteria
established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in
“Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013).” These criteria are in the areas of control
environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and communication, and monitoring. The
Company’s assessment included extensive documenting, evaluating and testing the design and operating
effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting.
The Company acquired Shockwave Medical, Inc. (Shockwave), in a business combination in May 2024.
Shockwave’s total assets, excluding intangible assets and goodwill, and total sales represented less
than 1% of each of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the fiscal year
ended December 29, 2024. As the acquisition occurred in the fiscal year 2024, the scope of the
Company's assessment of the design and effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting for
the fiscal year 2024 excluded the above mentioned acquisition. This exclusion is in accordance with
the SEC's general guidance that an assessment of a recently acquired business may be omitted from the
scope in the year of acquisition.
Based on the Company’s processes and assessment, as described above, management has concluded that,
as of December 29, 2024, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective.
The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 29, 2024
has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as
stated in their report, which appears herein.

Disclosure controls and procedures. At the end of the period covered by this Report, the Company
evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures.
The Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to
be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and
forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it
files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management,
including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar
functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Joaquin Duato,
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Joseph J. Wolk, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial
Officer, reviewed and participated in this evaluation. Based on this evaluation, Messrs. Duato and
Wolk concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Report, the Company’s disclosure
controls and procedures were effective.
