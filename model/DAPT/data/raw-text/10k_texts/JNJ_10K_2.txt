Cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements
This Annual Report on Form 10-K and Johnson & Johnson’s other publicly available documents contain
“forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the United States
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Management and representatives of Johnson & Johnson
and its subsidiaries (the Company) also may from time to time make forward-looking statements.
Forward-looking statements do not relate strictly to historical or current facts and reflect
management’s assumptions, views, plans, objectives and projections about the future. Forward-looking
statements may be identified by the use of words such as “plans,” “expects,” “will,” “anticipates,”
“estimates” and other words of similar meaning in conjunction with, among other things: discussions
of future operations; expected operating results and financial performance; impact of planned
acquisitions and dispositions; impact and timing of restructuring initiatives, including associated
cost savings and other benefits; the Company’s strategy for growth; product development activities;
regulatory approvals; market position and expenditures.
Because forward-looking statements are based on current beliefs, expectations and assumptions
regarding future events, they are subject to uncertainties, risks and changes that are difficult to
predict and many of which are outside of the Company’s control. Investors should realize that if
underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, or known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, the
Company’s actual results and financial condition could vary materially from expectations and
projections expressed or implied in its forward-looking statements. Investors are therefore cautioned
not to rely on these forward-looking statements. Risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited
to:
Risks related to product development, market success and competition
• Challenges and uncertainties inherent in innovation and development of new and improved products
and technologies on which the Company’s continued growth and success depend, including uncertainty of
clinical outcomes, additional analysis of existing clinical data, obtaining regulatory approvals,
health plan coverage and customer access, and initial and continued commercial success;
• Challenges to the Company’s ability to obtain and protect adequate patent and other intellectual
property rights for new and existing products and technologies in the United States and other
important markets;
• The impact of patent expirations, typically followed by the introduction of competing generic,
biosimilar or other products and resulting revenue and market share losses;
• Increasingly aggressive and frequent challenges to the Company’s patents by competitors and others
seeking to launch competing generic, biosimilar or other products and increased receptivity of
courts, the United States Patent and Trademark Office and other decision makers to such challenges,
potentially resulting in loss of market exclusivity and rapid decline in sales for the relevant
product sooner than expected;
• Competition in research and development of new and improved products, processes and technologies,
which can result in product and process obsolescence;
• Competition to reach agreement with third parties for collaboration, licensing, development and
marketing agreements for products and technologies;
• Competition based on cost-effectiveness, product performance, technological advances and patents
attained by competitors; and
• Allegations that the Company’s products infringe the patents and other intellectual property rights
of third parties, which could adversely affect the Company’s ability to sell the products in question
and require the payment of money damages and future royalties.
Risks related to product liability, litigation and regulatory activity
• Product efficacy or safety concerns, whether or not based on scientific evidence, potentially
resulting in product withdrawals, recalls, regulatory action on the part of the United States Food
and Drug Administration (U.S. FDA) (or international counterparts), declining sales, reputational
damage, increased litigation expense and share price impact;
• The impact, including declining sales and reputational damage, of significant litigation or
government action adverse to the Company, including product liability claims and allegations related
to pharmaceutical marketing practices and contracting strategies;
• The impact of an adverse judgment or settlement and the adequacy of reserves related to legal
proceedings, including patent litigation, product liability, personal injury claims, securities class
actions, government investigations, employment and other legal proceedings;
• Increased scrutiny of the healthcare industry by government agencies and state attorneys general
resulting in investigations and prosecutions, which carry the risk of significant civil and criminal
penalties, including, but not limited to, debarment from government business;
• Failure to meet compliance obligations in compliance agreements with governments or government
agencies, which could result in significant sanctions;
• Potential changes to applicable laws and regulations affecting United States and international
operations, including relating to: approval of new products; licensing and patent rights; sales and
promotion of healthcare products; access to, and reimbursement and pricing for, healthcare products
and services; environmental protection; and sourcing of raw materials;
• Compliance with local regulations and laws that may restrict the Company’s ability to manufacture
or sell its products in relevant markets, including requirements to comply with medical device
reporting regulations and other requirements such as the European Union’s Medical Devices Regulation;
• Changes in domestic and international tax laws and regulations, increasing audit scrutiny by tax
authorities around the world and exposures to additional tax liabilities potentially in excess of
existing reserves; and
• The issuance of new or revised accounting standards by the Financial Accounting Standards Board and
regulations by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Risks related to the Company’s strategic initiatives, healthcare market trends and the realization of
benefits from the separation of the Company’s Consumer Health Business
• Pricing pressures resulting from trends toward healthcare cost containment, including the continued
consolidation among healthcare providers and other market participants, trends toward managed care,
the shift toward governments increasingly becoming the primary payors of healthcare expenses,
significant new entrants to the healthcare markets seeking to reduce costs and government pressure on
companies to voluntarily reduce costs and price increases;
• Restricted spending patterns of individual, institutional and governmental purchasers of healthcare
products and services due to economic hardship and budgetary constraints;
• Challenges to the Company’s ability to realize its strategy for growth including through externally
sourced innovations, such as development collaborations, strategic acquisitions, licensing and
marketing agreements, and the potential heightened costs of any such external arrangements due to
competitive pressures;
• The potential that the expected strategic benefits and opportunities from any planned or completed
acquisition or divestiture by the Company may not be realized or may take longer to realize than
expected;
• The potential that the expected benefits and opportunities related to past and ongoing
restructuring actions may not be realized or may take longer to realize than expected;
• The Company’s ability to divest the Company’s remaining ownership interest in Kenvue Inc. (Kenvue)
and realize the anticipated benefits from the separation; and
• Kenvue's ability to succeed as a standalone publicly traded company.
Risks related to economic conditions, financial markets and operating internationally
• The risks associated with global operations on the Company and its customers and suppliers,
including foreign governments in countries in which the Company operates;
• The impact of inflation and fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates and the
potential effect of such fluctuations on revenues, expenses and resulting margins;
• Potential changes in export/import and trade laws, regulations and policies of the United States
and other countries, including any increased trade restrictions or tariffs and potential drug
reimportation legislation;
• The impact on international operations from financial instability in international economies,
sovereign risk, possible imposition of governmental controls and restrictive economic policies, and
unstable international governments and legal systems;
• The impact of global public health crises and pandemics;
• Changes to global climate, extreme weather and natural disasters that could affect demand for the
Company’s products and services, cause disruptions in manufacturing and distribution networks, alter
the availability of goods and services within the supply chain, and affect the overall design and
integrity of the Company’s products and operations;
• The impact of global or economic changes or events, including global tensions and war; and
• The impact of armed conflicts and terrorist attacks in the United States and other parts of the
world, including social and economic disruptions and instability of financial and other markets.
 Risks related to supply chain and operations 
• Difficulties and delays in manufacturing, internally, through third-party providers or otherwise
within the supply chain, that may lead to voluntary or involuntary business interruptions or
shutdowns, product shortages, withdrawals or suspensions of products from the market, and potential
regulatory action;
• Interruptions and breaches of the Company’s information technology systems or those of the
Company’s vendors, which could result in reputational, competitive, operational or other business
harm as well as financial costs and regulatory action;
• Reliance on global supply chains and production and distribution processes that are complex and
subject to increasing regulatory requirements that may adversely affect supply, sourcing and pricing
of materials used in the Company’s products; and
• The potential that the expected benefits and opportunities related to restructuring actions may not
be realized or may take longer to realize than expected, including due to any required approvals from
applicable regulatory authorities.
Investors also should carefully read the risk factors described in Item 1A of this Annual Report on
Form 10-K for a description of certain risks that could, among other things, cause the Company’s
actual results to differ materially from those expressed in its forward-looking statements. Investors
should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and should not
consider the risks described above and in Item 1A to be a complete statement of all potential risks
and uncertainties. The Company does not undertake to publicly update any forward-looking statement
that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information or future events or
developments.

│ Item 1. Business │
 General 
Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) have approximately 131,900 employees worldwide
engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the
healthcare field. Johnson & Johnson is a holding company, with operating companies conducting
business in virtually all countries of the world. The Company’s primary focus is products related to
human health and well-being. Johnson & Johnson was incorporated in the State of New Jersey in 1887.
The Executive Committee of Johnson & Johnson is the principal management group responsible for the
strategic operations and allocation of the resources of the Company. This Committee oversees and
coordinates the activities of the Company's two business segments: Innovative Medicine (previously
referred to as Pharmaceutical) and MedTech. Within the strategic parameters provided by the
Committee, senior management groups at U.S. and international operating companies are each
responsible for their own strategic plans and the day-to-day operations of those companies. Each
subsidiary within the business segments is, with limited exceptions, managed by residents of the
country where located.
 Segments of business 
Following the completion of the separation of the Consumer Health business (Kenvue) in August 2023,
the Company is now organized into two business segments: Innovative Medicine and MedTech. Additional
information required by this item is incorporated herein by reference to the narrative and tabular
descriptions of segments and operating results under: Item 7. Management’s discussion and analysis of
results of operations and financial condition of this Report; and Note 17 Segments of business and
geographic areas of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report.
 Innovative Medicine 
The Innovative Medicine segment is focused on the following therapeutic areas: Immunology (e.g.,
rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and psoriasis), Infectious
Diseases (e.g., HIV/AIDS), Neuroscience (e.g., mood disorders, neurodegenerative disorders and
schizophrenia), Oncology (e.g., prostate cancer, hematologic malignancies, lung cancer and bladder
cancer), Cardiovascular and Metabolism (e.g., thrombosis, diabetes and macular degeneration) and
Pulmonary Hypertension (e.g., Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension). Medicines in this segment are
distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers, distributors, hospitals and healthcare professionals
for prescription use. Key products in the Innovative Medicine segment include: REMICADE (infliximab),
a treatment for a number of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases; SIMPONI (golimumab), a
subcutaneous treatment for adults with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis, active psoriatic
arthritis, active ankylosing spondylitis and moderately active to severely active ulcerative colitis;
SIMPONI ARIA (golimumab), an intravenous treatment for adults with moderate to severe rheumatoid
arthritis, active psoriatic arthritis and active ankylosing spondylitis and active polyarticular
juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA) in people 2 years of age and older; STELARA (ustekinumab), a
treatment for adults and children with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, for adults with active
psoriatic arthritis, for adults with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease and treatment of
moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis; TREMFYA (guselkumab), a treatment for adults with
moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and active psoriatic arthritis; EDURANT (rilpivirine), PREZISTA
(darunavir) and PREZCOBIX/REZOLSTA (darunavir/cobicistat), antiretroviral medicines for the treatment
of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in combination with other antiretroviral products and SYMTUZA
(darunavir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide), a once-daily single tablet regimen for
the treatment of HIV; CONCERTA (methylphenidate HCl) extended-release tablets CII, a treatment for
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; INVEGA SUSTENNA/XEPLION (paliperidone palmitate), for the
treatment of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder in adults; INVEGA TRINZA/TREVICTA
(paliperidone palmitate), for the treatment of schizophrenia in patients after they have been
adequately treated with INVEGA SUSTENNA for at least four months; SPRAVATO (Esketamine), a nasal
spray, used along with an oral antidepressant, to treat adults with treatment-resistant depression
(TRD) and depressive symptoms in adults with major depressive disorder (MDD) with suicidal thoughts
or actions; CARVYKTI (ciltacabtagene autoleucel), a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T-cell therapy
for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma; ZYTIGA (abiraterone
 2023 Annual Report1 
acetate), a treatment for patients with prostate cancer; ERLEADA (apalutamide), a next- generation
androgen receptor inhibitor for the treatment of patients with prostate cancer; IMBRUVICA
(ibrutinib), a treatment for certain B-cell malignancies, or blood cancers and chronic graft versus
host disease; DARZALEX (daratumumab), a treatment for multiple myeloma; DARZALEX FASPRO (daratumumab
and hyaluronidase-fihj), a treatment for multiple myeloma and light chain (AL) Amyloidosis; XARELTO
(rivaroxaban), an oral anticoagulant for the prevention of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which may lead
to pulmonary embolism (PE) in patients undergoing hip or knee replacement surgery, to reduce the risk
of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, and for the
treatment and reduction of risk of recurrence of DVT and PE to reduce the risk of major
cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and peripheral artery disease
(PAD), for the treatment and secondary prevention of thromboembolism in pediatric patients, and for
thromboprophylaxis in pediatric patients following the Fontan procedure; OPSUMIT (macitentan) as
monotherapy or in combination, indicated for the long-term treatment of pulmonary arterial
hypertension (PAH); UPTRAVI (selexipag), the only approved oral and intravenous, selective IP
receptor agonist targeting a prostacyclin pathway in PAH. Many of these medicines were developed in
collaboration with strategic partners or are licensed from other companies and maintain active
lifecycle development programs.
 MedTech 
The MedTech segment includes a broad portfolio of products used in the Interventional Solutions,
Orthopaedics, Surgery and Vision categories. Interventional Solutions include electrophysiology
products (Biosense Webster) to treat heart rhythm disorders, the heart recovery portfolio (Abiomed)
which includes technologies to treat severe coronary artery disease requiring high-risk PCI or AMI
cardiogenic shock, and Neurovascular care (Cerenovus) that treats hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke.
The Orthopaedics portfolio (DePuy Synthes) includes products and enabling technologies that support
Hips, Knees, Trauma, and Spine, Sports & Other. The Surgery portfolios include advanced and general
surgery technologies (Ethicon), as well as solutions that focus on breast aesthetics (Mentor), and
Ear, Nose and Throat (Acclarent) procedures. Johnson & Johnson Vision products include ACUVUE Brand
contact lenses and TECNIS intraocular lenses for cataract surgery. These products are distributed to
wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used predominantly in the professional fields by
physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics.
 Geographic areas 
Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) have approximately 131,900 employees worldwide
engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the
healthcare field. The Company conducts business in virtually all countries of the world with the
primary focus on products related to human health and well-being.
The products made and sold in the international business include many of those described above under
Segments of Business – Innovative Medicine and MedTech. However, the principal markets, products and
methods of distribution in the international business vary with the country and the culture. The
products sold in international business include those developed in the U.S. and by subsidiaries
abroad.
Investments and activities in some countries outside the U.S. are subject to higher risks than
comparable U.S. activities because the investment and commercial climate may be influenced by
financial instability in international economies, restrictive economic policies and political and
legal system uncertainties.
 Raw materials 
Raw materials essential to the Company's business are generally readily available from multiple
sources. Where there are exceptions, the temporary unavailability of those raw materials would not
likely have a material adverse effect on the financial results of the Company.
 Patents 
The Company's subsidiaries have made a practice of obtaining patent protection on their products and
processes where possible. They own, or are licensed under, a significant number of patents in the
U.S. and other countries relating to their products, product uses, formulations and manufacturing
processes, which in the aggregate are believed to be of material importance to the Company in the
operation of its businesses. The Company’s subsidiaries face patent challenges from third parties,
including challenges seeking to manufacture and market generic and biosimilar versions of the
Company's key
 2 
pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products.
Significant legal proceedings and claims involving the Company's patent and other intellectual
property are described in Note 19 Legal proceedings—Intellectual property of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.
Sales of the Company’s largest product, STELARA (ustekinumab) accounted for approximately 12.8% of
the Company's total revenues for fiscal 2023. Accordingly, the patents related to this product are
believed to be material to the Company. Janssen Biotech, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Johnson &
Johnson, owns patents specifically related to STELARA. The latest expiring United States composition
of matter patent expired in 2023. As a result of settlements and other agreements with third parties,
the Company does not anticipate the launch of a biosimilar version of STELARA before January 1, 2025
in the United States. The latest expiring European composition of matter patent (Supplementary
Protection Certificate) expires in 2024.
Sales of the Company’s second largest product, collectively DARZALEX (daratumumab) and DARZALEX
FASPRO (daratumumab and hyaluronidase-fihj), accounted for approximately 11.4% of the Company's total
revenues for fiscal 2023. Accordingly, the patents related to this product are believed to be
material to the Company. Genmab A/S owns two patent families related to DARZALEX, and Janssen
Biotech, Inc. has an exclusive license to those patent families. The two patent families both expire
in the United States in 2029, and in Europe, compound patent protection in select countries extends
to 2031/2032. Janssen Biotech, Inc. owns a separate patent portfolio related to DARZALEX FASPRO.
 Trademarks 
The Company’s subsidiaries have made a practice of selling their products under trademarks and of
obtaining protection for these trademarks by all available means. These trademarks are protected by
registration in the U.S. and other countries where such products are marketed. The Company considers
these trademarks in the aggregate to be of material importance in the operation of its businesses.
 Seasonality 
Worldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality; however, spending has typically
been heavier in the fourth quarter of each year than in other quarters. This reflects increased
spending decisions, principally for research and development activity.
 Competition 
In all of their product lines, the Company's subsidiaries compete with companies both locally and
globally. Competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the
competing companies involved. Competition in research, both internally and externally sourced,
involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes, is
particularly significant. The development of new and innovative products, as well as protecting the
underlying intellectual property of the Company’s product portfolio, is important to the Company's
success in all areas of its business. The competitive environment requires substantial investments in
continuing research.
 Environment 
The Company is subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations in the United States and
other jurisdictions. The Company believes that its operations comply in all material respects with
applicable environmental laws and regulations. The Company’s compliance with these requirements is
not expected to have a material effect upon its capital expenditures, cash flows, earnings or
competitive position.
 2023 Annual Report3 
 Regulation 
The Company’s businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries
in which operations are conducted, and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation
and enforcement. The Company is subject to costly and complex U.S. and foreign laws and governmental
regulations and any adverse regulatory action may materially adversely affect the Company's financial
condition and business operations. In the U.S., the pharmaceutical product and medical technology
industries have long been subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies, primarily as
to product safety, efficacy, manufacturing, advertising, labeling and safety reporting. The exercise
of broad regulatory powers by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the U.S. FDA) continues to
result in increases in the amounts of testing and documentation required for U.S. FDA approval of new
drugs and devices and a corresponding increase in the expense of product introduction. Similar trends
are also evident in major markets outside of the U.S.
The new medical device regulatory framework and the evolving privacy, data localization, and emerging
cyber security laws and regulations around the world are examples of such increased regulation.
Within the U.S., an increasing number of U.S. States have enacted comprehensive privacy laws and
federal regulators (e.g., the U.S. FDA, FTC and HHS) continue to stress the intersection of health
and privacy as a compliance and enforcement priority. In the EU, multiple directives and laws
(including NIS2, EHDS, the Data Act, the Cyber Resilience Act, and the AI Act) are rapidly changing
privacy and cybersecurity compliance requirements while introducing new enforcement risks. In
addition, China has introduced broad personal information protection and data security regulations,
with more anticipated, thereby increasing China’s scrutiny of company compliance and data transfer
practices. With other jurisdictions enacting similar privacy laws, local data protection authorities
will force greater accountability on the collection, access and use of personal data in the
healthcare industry. These laws can also restrict transfers of data across borders, potentially
impacting how data-driven health care solutions are developed and deployed globally in a compliant
manner. Moreover, as a result of the broad scale release and availability of Artificial Intelligence
(AI) technologies such as generative AI, a global trend towards more comprehensive and nuanced
regulation (e.g., White House’s Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and
Use of Artificial Intelligence; the EU AI Act) to ensure the ethical use, privacy, and security of AI
is underway that includes standards for transparency, accountability, and fairness, which will
require compliance developments or enhancements.
The regulatory agencies under whose purview the Company operates have administrative powers that may
subject it to actions such as product withdrawals, recalls, seizure of products and other civil and
criminal sanctions. In some cases, the Company’s subsidiaries may deem it advisable to initiate
product recalls regardless of whether it has been required or directed to.
The U.S. FDA and regulatory agencies around the globe are also increasing their enforcement
activities. If the U.S. FDA were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or
regulations, or that any of our pharmaceutical products or medical technologies are ineffective or
pose an unreasonable health risk, the U.S. FDA could ban such products, detain or seize adulterated
or misbranded products, order a recall, repair, replacement, or refund of such products, refuse to
grant pending applications for marketing authorization or require certificates of foreign governments
for exports, and/or require us to notify health professionals and others that the products present
unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. The U.S. FDA may also assess civil or
criminal penalties against us, our officers or employees and impose operating restrictions on a
company-wide basis, or enjoin and/or restrain certain conduct resulting in violations of applicable
law. The U.S. FDA may also recommend prosecution to the U.S. Department of Justice. Any adverse
regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict us from effectively marketing and selling
our products and limit our ability to obtain future clearances or approvals, and could result in a
substantial modification to our business practices and operations. Equivalent enforcement mechanisms
exist in different countries in which we conduct business.
The costs of human healthcare have been and continue to be a subject of study, investigation and
regulation by governmental agencies and legislative bodies around the world. In the U.S., attention
has been focused by states, regulatory agencies and Congress on prices, profits, overutilization and
the quality and costs of healthcare generally. Laws and regulations have been enacted to require
adherence to strict compliance standards and prevent fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry.
There is increased focus on interactions and financial relationships between healthcare companies and
healthcare providers. Various state and federal transparency laws and regulations require disclosures
of payments and other transfers of value made to certain healthcare practitioners, including
physicians, teaching hospitals, and certain non-physician practitioners. Federal and foreign laws
governing international business practices require strict compliance with anti-bribery standards and
certain prohibitions with respect to payments to any foreign government official. Payors and Pharmacy
Benefit Managers (PBMs) are a potent force in the marketplace, and increased attention is being paid
to the impact of PBM practices on healthcare cost and access in the U.S.
Our business has been and continues to be affected by federal and state legislation that alters the
pricing, coverage, and reimbursement landscape. At the federal level, in August 2022, President Biden
signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act
 4 
(IRA), which includes provisions that effectively authorize the government to establish prices for
certain high-spend single-source drugs and biologics reimbursed by the Medicare program, starting in
2026 for Medicare Part D drugs and 2028 for Medicare Part B drugs. On August 29, 2023, the Centers
for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) published the first “Selected Drug” list, which includes
XARELTO and STELARA as well as IMBRUVICA, which is developed in collaboration and co-commercialized
in the U.S. with Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie company. The Selected Drug list also included other
medicines targeting disease states that are prevalent in the Medicare population. There remains
uncertainty, however, regarding how the federal government will establish prices for the selected
products, as the IRA specifies a ceiling price but not a minimum price. In any event, we anticipate
that the selected products will be subjected to a government-established price for the Medicare
population.
The IRA also contains provisions that impose rebates if certain prices increase at a rate that
outpaces the rate of inflation, beginning October 1, 2022, for Medicare Part D drugs and January 1,
2023, for Medicare Part B drugs. Separate IRA provisions redesign the Medicare Part D benefit in
various ways, including by shifting a greater portion of costs to manufacturers within certain
coverage phases and replacing the Part D coverage gap discount program with a new manufacturer
discounting program. Failure to comply with IRA provisions may subject manufacturers to various
penalties, including civil monetary penalties.
In July 2023, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Janssen) filed litigation against the U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services as well as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services challenging the
constitutionality of the Inflation Reduction Act’s (IRA) Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program. The
litigation requests a declaration that the IRA violates Janssen’s rights under the First Amendment
and the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution and therefore that Janssen is not subject to the IRA’s
mandatory pricing scheme. The impact of the IRA on our business and the broader pharmaceutical
industry remains uncertain, as litigation filed by Janssen and other pharmaceutical companies remains
ongoing and CMS has yet to publicly announce the maximum fair price for each of the selected drugs.
Additionally, we expect continued scrutiny on drug pricing and government price reporting from
Congress, agencies, and other bodies at the federal and state levels, which may result in additional
regulations or other mechanisms to increase pricing transparency and controls.
There are a number of additional bills pending in Congress and healthcare reform proposals at the
state level that would affect drug pricing, including in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This
changing legal landscape has both positive and negative impacts on the U.S. healthcare industry with
much remaining uncertain as to how various provisions of federal and state law, and potential
modification or repeal of these laws, will ultimately affect the industry. The IRA and any other
federal or state legislative change could affect the pricing and market conditions for our products.
In addition, business practices in the healthcare industry have come under increased scrutiny,
particularly in the U.S., by government agencies and state attorneys general, and resulting
investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties. Of note
is the increased enforcement activity by data protection authorities in various jurisdictions,
particularly in the European Union, where significant fines have been levied on companies for data
breaches, violations of privacy requirements, and unlawful cross-border data transfers. In the U.S.,
the Federal Trade Commission has stepped up enforcement of data privacy with several significant
settlements (including settlements concerning the downstream sharing of personal information and use
and disclosure of personal health data) and there have been a material increase in class-action
lawsuits linked to the collection and use of biometric data and use of tracking technologies.
Further, the Company relies on global supply chains, and production and distribution processes, that
are complex, and subject to increasing regulatory requirements that may affect sourcing, supply and
pricing of materials used in the Company's products. These processes also are subject to complex and
lengthy regulatory approvals.

 Strategy 
The Company believes that its employees are critical to its continued success and are an essential
element of its long-term strategy. Management is responsible for ensuring that its policies and
processes reflect and reinforce the Company's desired corporate culture, including policies and
processes related to strategy, risk management, and ethics and compliance. The Company’s human
capital management strategy is built on three fundamental focus areas:
 • 
 Attracting and recruiting the best talent 
 • 
 Developing and retaining talent 
 • 
 Empowering and inspiring talent 
Underpinning these focus areas are ongoing efforts to cultivate and foster a culture built on
diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), innovation, health, well-being and safety, where the Company's
employees are encouraged to succeed both professionally and personally while helping the Company
achieve its business goals.
 Culture and employee engagement 
At the Company, employees are guided by Our Credo which sets forth the Company's responsibilities to
patients, consumers, customers, healthcare professionals, employees, communities and shareholders.
Employees worldwide must adhere to the Company’s Code of Business Conduct which sets basic
requirements and serves as a foundation for the Company policies, procedures and guidelines, all of
which provide additional guidance on expected employee behaviors in every market where it operates.
The Company conducts global surveys that offer its employees the ability to provide feedback and
valuable insight to help address potential human resources risks and identify opportunities to
improve. In 2023, 94% of global employees across 76 countries participated in Our Credo Survey which
was offered in 36 languages.
 Growth and development 
To lead in the changing healthcare landscape, it is crucial that the Company continue to attract and
retain top talent. In 2023, the Company's voluntary turnover rate was 7%. The Company believes that
its employees must be equipped with the right knowledge and skills and be provided with opportunities
to grow and develop in their careers. Accordingly, professional development programs and educational
resources are available to all employees. The Company's objective is to foster a learning culture
that helps shape each person’s unique career path while creating a robust pipeline of talent to
deliver on the Company’s long-term strategies. In furtherance of this objective, the Company deploys
a global approach to ensure development is for everyone, regardless of where they are on their career
journey. To prioritize learning, the Company recently held Johnson & Johnson's first Global Learning
Day. Employees were encouraged to set aside a full day to explore skill-building courses across five
areas: leadership, business skills, digital upskilling, DEI, and well-being, on J&J Learn, the
Company's new learning platform.
 Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) 
The Company is committed to workplace diversity and to cultivating, fostering, and advancing a
culture of equity and inclusion. The Company’s evidenced-based global enterprise Diversity, Equity
and Inclusion strategy recognizes how DEI accelerates the Company's ability to meet the changing
needs of the communities the Company serves in, as outlined in Our Credo. The Company’s DEI Vision
is: Be yourself, change the world . The Company's DEI Mission is: Make diversity, equity and
inclusion how we work everyday . The Company's enterprise DEI Strategy is aligned to the DEI Vision
and Mission and rests on four core pillars:
• Build a workforce of individuals with diverse backgrounds, cultures, abilities and perspectives
• Foster a culture of inclusion where every individual belongs
• Transform talent and business processes to achieve equitable opportunities for all
• Drive innovation and growth with our business to serve diverse markets around the world
The Company's DEI strategy is guided by internal and external insights, global best practices and
continual employee feedback and recognizes that while diversity changes by location, inclusion is the
same everywhere.
 2023 Annual Report7 
 Compensation and benefits 
As part of the Company's total rewards philosophy, the Company offers competitive compensation and
benefits to attract and retain top talent. The Company is committed to fairness and equitable
treatment in its compensation and benefits for employees at all levels. The Company observes legal
minimum wage provisions and exceeds them where possible. The Company's total rewards offerings
include an array of programs to support its employees' well-being, including annual performance
incentive opportunities, pension and retirement savings programs, health and welfare benefits, paid
time off, leave programs, flexible work schedules and employee assistance programs. In recognition of
the Company’s commitment to help employees balance their personal and professional responsibilities,
the Company enhanced its caregiver, bereavement, and volunteer paid leave benefits, effective July
2023.
 Health, wellness and safety 
The Company’s investment in employee health, well-being and safety is built on its conviction that
advancing health for humanity starts with advancing the health of its employees. With the right
awareness, focus, practices and tools, the Company ensures that all its employees around the world,
as well as temporary contractors and visitors to the Company's sites, can work safely. The Company
has continuously expanded health and well-being programs throughout the Company and across the globe,
incorporating new thinking and technologies to keep its offerings best-in-class and to help employees
achieve their personal health goals. The programs and practices the Company advances for total
health—physical, mental, emotional and financial—ensure employee health protection for emerging
health risks. The Company continues to address our employees needs through J&J Flex, a hybrid model
that empowers the Company’s office-based employees to find the right productivity and balance of in-
person and remote work.

│ Item 1A. Risk factors │
An investment in the Company’s common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties. The
Company seeks to identify, manage and mitigate risks to our business, but uncertainties and risks are
difficult to predict and many are outside of the Company’s control and cannot therefore be
eliminated. In addition to the other information in this report and the Company’s other filings with
the SEC, investors should consider carefully the factors set forth below. Investors should be aware
that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and that the following is not meant
to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties. If known or unknown risks or
uncertainties materialize, the Company’s business, results of operations or financial condition could
be adversely affected, potentially in a material way.
 Risks related to our business, industry and operations 
The Company’s businesses operate in highly competitive product markets and competitive pressures
could adversely affect the Company’s earnings.
The Company faces substantial competition in its two operating segments and in all geographic
markets. The Company’s businesses compete with companies of all sizes on the basis of cost-
effectiveness, technological innovations, intellectual property rights, product performance, real or
perceived product advantages, pricing and availability and rate of reimbursement. The Company also
competes with other market participants in securing rights to acquisitions, collaborations and
licensing agreements with third parties. Competition for rights to product candidates and
technologies may result in significant investment and acquisition costs and onerous agreement terms
for the Company. Competitors’ development of more effective or less costly products, and/or their
ability to secure patent and other intellectual property rights and successfully market products
ahead of the Company, could negatively impact sales of the Company’s existing products as well as its
ability to bring new products to market despite significant prior investment in the related product
development. The Company may also experience operational and financial risk in connection with
acquisitions if we are unable to fully identify potential risks and liabilities associated with
acquired businesses or products, successfully integrate operations and employees, and successfully
identify and realize synergies with existing businesses while containing acquisition-related strain
on our management, operations and financial resources.
For the Company’s Innovative Medicine businesses, loss of patent exclusivity for a product often is
followed by a substantial reduction in sales as competitors gain regulatory approval for generic and
other competing products and enter the market. Similar competition can be triggered by the loss of
exclusivity for a biological product. For the Company’s MedTech businesses, technological innovation,
product quality, reputation and customer service are especially important to competitiveness.
Development by other companies of new or improved products, processes and technologies could threaten
to make the Company’s products or technologies less desirable, less economical or obsolete. The
Company’s business and operations will be negatively impacted if we are unable to introduce new
products or technological advances that are safe, more effective, more effectively marketed or
otherwise outperform those of our competitors.
Interruptions and delays in manufacturing operations could adversely affect the Company’s business,
sales and reputation.
The Company’s manufacturing of products requires the timely delivery of sufficient amounts of
complex, high-quality components and materials. The Company’s subsidiaries operate 61 manufacturing
facilities as well as sourcing from thousands of suppliers around the world. The Company has in the
past, and may in the future, face unanticipated interruptions and delays in manufacturing through its
internal or external supply chain. Manufacturing disruptions can occur for many reasons including
regulatory action, production quality deviations or safety issues, labor disputes, labor shortages,
site-specific incidents (such as fires), natural disasters such as hurricanes and other severe
weather events, raw material shortages, political unrest, terrorist attacks and epidemics or
pandemics. Such delays and difficulties in manufacturing can result in product shortages, declines in
sales and reputational impact as well as significant remediation and related costs associated with
addressing the shortage.
The Company relies on third parties to manufacture and supply certain of our products. Any failure by
or loss of a third-party manufacturer or supplier could result in delays and increased costs, which
may adversely affect our business.
The Company relies on third parties to manufacture and supply certain of our raw materials, component
parts and products. We depend on these third-party manufacturers to allocate to us a portion of their
manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality and at
acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis and at
acceptable prices. However, we cannot guarantee that these third-party manufacturers will be able to
meet our near-term or long-term manufacturing requirements, which could result in lost sales and have
an adverse effect on our business.
 2023 Annual Report9 
Other risks associated with our reliance on third parties to manufacture these products include
reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance, misappropriation of the
Company’s intellectual property, limited ability to manage our inventory, possible breach of the
manufacturing agreement by the third party and the possible termination or nonrenewal of the
manufacturing agreement by the third party at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us. Moreover,
if any of our third- party manufacturers suffers any damage to facilities, loses benefits under
material agreements, experiences power outages, encounters financial difficulties, is unable to
secure necessary raw materials from its suppliers or suffers any other reduction in efficiency, the
Company may experience significant business disruption. In the event of any such disruption, the
Company would need to seek and source other qualified third-party manufacturers, likely resulting in
further delays and increased costs which could affect our business adversely.
Counterfeit versions of our products could harm our patients and have a negative impact on our
revenues, earnings, reputation and business.
Our industry continues to be challenged by the vulnerability of distribution channels to illegal
counterfeiting and the presence of counterfeit products in a growing number of markets and over the
Internet. Third parties may illegally distribute and sell counterfeit versions of our products, which
do not meet our rigorous manufacturing and testing standards. To distributors and patients,
counterfeit products may be visually indistinguishable from the authentic version. Counterfeit
medicines pose a risk to patient health and safety because of the conditions under which they are
manufactured – often in unregulated, unlicensed, uninspected and unsanitary sites – as well as the
lack of regulation of their contents.
The industry’s failure to mitigate the threat of counterfeit medicines could adversely impact our
business and reputation by impacting patient confidence in our authentic products, potentially
resulting in lost sales, product recalls, and an increased threat of litigation. In addition,
diversion of our products from their authorized market into other channels may result in reduced
revenues and negatively affect our profitability.
Global health crises, pandemics, epidemics, or other outbreaks could adversely disrupt or impact
certain aspects of the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.
We are subject to risks associated with global health crises, epidemics, pandemics and other
outbreaks (such incident(s), a health crisis or health crises). For example, the COVID-19 pandemic
adversely impacted certain aspects of the Company’s business, results of operations and financial
condition, including lower sales and reduced customer demand and usage of certain of our products.
The spread of any health crises may cause the Company to modify its business practices, and take
further actions as may be required by government authorities or as the Company determines are in the
best interests of our patients, customers, employees and business partners under such circumstances.
While the Company has robust business continuity plans in place across our global supply chain
network designed to help mitigate the impact of health crises, these efforts may not completely
prevent our business from being adversely affected in the event of a health crisis. Health crises
could adversely impact the Company’s operations, including, among other things, our manufacturing
operations, supply chain, third-party suppliers, sales and marketing, and clinical trial operations.
Any of these factors could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial results, and global
economic conditions generally.
Risks related to government regulation and legal proceedings
Global sales in the Company’s Innovative Medicine and MedTech segments may be negatively impacted by
healthcare reforms and increasing pricing pressures.
Sales of the Company’s Innovative Medicine and MedTech products are significantly affected by
reimbursements by third- party payors such as government healthcare programs, private insurance plans
and managed care organizations. As part of various efforts to contain healthcare costs, these payors
are putting downward pressure on prices at which products will be reimbursed. In the U.S., increased
purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of Medicare, Medicaid, and private sector
beneficiaries, in part due to continued consolidation among healthcare providers, could result in
further pricing pressures. In addition, recent legislation and ongoing political scrutiny on pricing,
coverage and reimbursement could result in additional pricing pressures. Specifically, the Inflation
Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) may subject certain products to government-established pricing,
potentially impose rebates, and subject manufacturers who fail to adhere to the government's
interpretations of the law to penalties. Further, increased third-party utilization of the 340B
Federal Drug Discount Program from expanded interpretations of the statute may have a negative impact
on the Company's financial performance. Outside the U.S., numerous major markets, including the EU,
United Kingdom, Japan and China, have pervasive government involvement in funding healthcare and, in
that regard, directly or indirectly impose price controls, limit access to, or reimbursement for, the
Company’s products, or reduce the value of its intellectual property protection.
 10 
We are subject to an increasing number of costly and complex governmental regulations in the
countries in which operations are conducted which may materially adversely affect the Company’s
financial condition and business operations.
As described in Item 1. Business, the Company is subject to an increasing number of extensive
government laws and regulations, investigations and legal action by national, state and local
government agencies in the U.S. and other countries in which it operates. For example, changes to the
U.S. FDA’s timing or requirements for approval or clearance of our products may have a negative
impact on our ability to bring new products to market. New laws and regulations may also impose
deadlines on the Company, or its third-party suppliers, manufacturers or other partners and
providers, for which there may be insufficient time to implement changes to comply with such new
regulations and may result in manufacturing delays or other supply chain constraints. If the Company
is unable to identify ways to mitigate these delays or constraints, there may be an adverse effect on
sales and access to our products.
The Company is subject to significant legal proceedings that can result in significant expenses,
fines and reputational damage.
In the ordinary course of business, Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous
claims and lawsuits involving various issues such as product liability, patent disputes and claims
that their product sales, marketing and pricing practices violate various antitrust, unfair trade
practices and/or consumer protection laws. The Company’s more significant legal proceedings are
described in Note 19 Legal proceedings under Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included
in Item 8 of this Report. Litigation, in general, and securities, derivative action, class action and
multi-district litigation, in particular, can be expensive and disruptive. Some of these matters may
include thousands of plaintiffs, may involve parties seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts,
including punitive or exemplary damages, and may remain unresolved for several years. For example,
the Company is a defendant in numerous lawsuits arising out of the use of body powders containing
talc, primarily JOHNSON’S Baby Powder, and the Company’s sale, manufacturing and marketing of
opioids. While the Company believes it has substantial defenses in these matters, it is not feasible
to predict the ultimate outcome of litigation. The Company could in the future be required to pay
significant amounts as a result of settlements or judgments in these matters, potentially in excess
of accruals, including matters where the Company could be held jointly and severally liable among
other defendants. The resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any
reporting period could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and cash
flows for that period. The Company does not purchase third-party product liability insurance;
however, the Company utilizes a wholly owned captive insurance company subject to certain limits.
Product reliability, safety and effectiveness concerns can have significant negative impacts on sales
and results of operations, lead to litigation and cause reputational damage.
Concerns about product safety, whether raised internally or by litigants, regulators or consumer
advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence, can result in safety alerts, product
recalls, governmental investigations, regulatory action on the part of the U.S. FDA (or its
counterpart in other countries), private claims and lawsuits, payment of fines and settlements,
declining sales and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand
image, brand equity and consumer trust in the Company’s products. Product recalls have in the past,
and could in the future, prompt government investigations and inspections, the shutdown of
manufacturing facilities, continued product shortages and related sales declines, significant
remediation costs, reputational damage, possible civil penalties and criminal prosecution.
The Company faces significant regulatory scrutiny, which imposes significant compliance costs and
exposes the Company to government investigations, legal actions and penalties.
The rapid increase in new government laws and regulations imposes significant compliance costs to the
Company and a failure of the Company to timely implement changes to comply with these new laws may
expose the Company to investigations, legal actions or penalties. Regulatory issues regarding
compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) (and comparable quality regulations in
foreign countries) by manufacturers of drugs and devices can lead to fines and penalties, product
recalls, product shortages, interruptions in production, delays in new product approvals and
litigation. In addition, the marketing, pricing and sale of the Company’s products are subject to
regulation, investigations and legal actions including under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act, the Medicaid Rebate Program, federal and state false claims acts, state unfair trade practices
acts and consumer protection laws. Scrutiny of healthcare industry business practices by government
agencies and state attorneys general in the U.S., and any resulting investigations and prosecutions,
carry risk of significant civil and criminal penalties including, but not limited to, debarment from
participation in government healthcare programs. Any such debarment could have a material adverse
effect on the Company’s business and results of operations. The most significant current
investigations and litigation brought by government agencies are described in Note 19 Legal
proceedings—Government proceedings under Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in
Item 8 of this Report.
 2023 Annual Report11 
Changes in tax laws or exposures to additional tax liabilities could negatively impact the Company’s
operating results.
Changes in tax laws or regulations around the world, including in the U.S. and as led by the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, such as the recent enactment by certain EU and
non-EU countries, and the anticipated enactment by additional countries, of a global minimum tax,
could negatively impact the Company’s effective tax rate and results of operations. A change in
statutory tax rate or certain international tax provisions in any country would result in the
revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular
jurisdiction in the period in which the new tax law is enacted. This change would result in an
expense or benefit recorded to the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The Company closely
monitors these proposals as they arise in the countries where it operates. Changes to tax laws or
regulations may occur at any time, and any related expense or benefit recorded may be material to the
fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted.
See Note 8 Income taxes under Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of
this Report for additional information.
The Company conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and is addressing tax
audits and disputes with many tax authorities. In connection with various government initiatives,
companies are required to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the
world, which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in other countries. The Company
regularly assesses the likely outcomes of its tax audits and disputes to determine the
appropriateness of its tax reserves. However, any tax authority could take a position on tax
treatment that is contrary to the Company’s expectations, which could result in tax liabilities in
excess of reserves.
 Risks related to our intellectual property 
The Company faces increased challenges to intellectual property rights central to its business.
The Company owns or licenses a significant number of patents and other proprietary rights relating to
its products and manufacturing processes. These rights are essential to the Company’s businesses and
materially important to the Company’s results of operations. Public policy, both within and outside
the U.S., has become increasingly unfavorable toward intellectual property rights. The Company cannot
be certain that it will obtain adequate patent protection for new products and technologies in the
United States and other important markets or that such protections, once granted, will last as long
as originally anticipated.
Competitors routinely challenge the validity or extent of the Company’s owned or licensed patents and
proprietary rights through litigation, interferences, oppositions and other proceedings, such as
inter partes review (IPR) proceedings before the United States Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO).
These proceedings absorb resources and can be protracted as well as unpredictable. In addition,
challenges that the Company’s products infringe the patents of third parties could result in an
injunction and/or the need to pay past damages and future royalties and adversely affect the
competitive position and sales of the products in question.
The Company has faced increasing patent challenges from third parties seeking to manufacture and
market generic and biosimilar versions of the Company’s key pharmaceutical products prior to
expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. In the U.S., manufacturers of generic
versions of innovative human pharmaceutical products may challenge the validity, or claim non-
infringement, of innovator products through the Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, process
with the U.S. FDA and related ANDA litigation. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act
(BPCIA), enacted in 2010, which created a new regulatory pathway for the approval by the U.S. FDA of
biosimilar alternatives to innovator-developed biological products, also created mechanisms for
biosimilar applicants to challenge the patents on the innovator biologics. The IPR process with the
USPTO is also being used by competitors to challenge patents asserted in litigation.
In the event the Company is not successful in defending its patents against such challenges, or upon
the “at-risk” launch by the generic or biosimilar firm of its product, the Company can lose a major
portion of revenues for the referenced product in a very short period of time. Current legal
proceedings involving the Company’s patents and other intellectual property rights are described in
Note 19 Legal proceedings—Intellectual property under Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
included in Item 8 of this Report.
 12 
Risks related to product development, regulatory approval and commercialization
Significant challenges or delays in the Company’s innovation, development and implementation of new
products, technologies and indications could have an adverse impact on the Company’s long-term
success.
The Company’s continued growth and success depends on its ability to innovate and develop new and
differentiated products and services that address the evolving healthcare needs of patients,
providers and consumers. Development of successful products and technologies is also necessary to
offset revenue losses when the Company’s existing products lose market share due to various factors
such as competition and loss of patent exclusivity. New products introduced within the past five
years accounted for approximately 25% of 2023 sales. The Company cannot be certain when or whether it
will be able to develop, license or otherwise acquire companies, products and technologies, whether
particular product candidates will be granted regulatory approval, and, if approved, whether the
products will be commercially successful.
The Company pursues product development through internal research and development as well as through
collaborations, acquisitions, joint ventures and licensing or other arrangements with third parties.
In all of these contexts, developing new products, particularly pharmaceutical and biotechnology
products and medical devices, requires significant investment of resources over many years. Only a
very few biopharmaceutical research and development programs result in commercially viable products.
The process depends on many factors including the ability to: discern patients’ and healthcare
providers’ future needs; develop promising new compounds, strategies and technologies; achieve
successful clinical trial results; secure effective intellectual property protection; obtain
regulatory approvals on a timely basis; and, if and when they reach the market, successfully
differentiate the Company’s products from competing products and approaches to treatment. New
products or enhancements to existing products may not be accepted quickly or significantly in the
marketplace due to product and price competition, changes in customer preferences or healthcare
purchasing patterns, resistance by healthcare providers or uncertainty over third-party
reimbursement. Even following initial regulatory approval, the success of a product can be adversely
impacted by safety and efficacy findings in larger real-world patient populations, as well as market
entry of competitive products.
The Company leverages the use of data science, machine learning and other forms of AI and emerging
technologies across varying parts of its business and operations, and the introduction and
incorporation of AI may result in unintended consequences or other new or expanded risks and
liabilities. AI technology is continuously evolving, and the AI technologies we develop and adopt may
become obsolete earlier than planned. Our investments in these technologies may not result in the
benefits we anticipate or enable us to obtain or maintain a competitive advantage. The application of
machine learning and AI in our business is emerging and evolving alongside new laws and regulations
that may entail significant costs or ultimately limit our ability to continue the use of these
technologies. These technologies also carry inherent risks related to data privacy and security
further described below.
 Risks related to financial and economic market conditions 
The Company faces a variety of financial, economic, legal, social and political risks associated with
conducting business internationally.
The Company’s extensive operations and business activity throughout the world are accompanied by
certain financial, economic, legal, social and political risks, including those listed below.
Foreign currency exchange : In fiscal 2023, approximately 45% of the Company’s sales occurred outside
of the U.S., with approximately 24% in Europe, 5% in the Western Hemisphere, excluding the U.S., and
16% in the Asia-Pacific and Africa region. Changes in non-U.S. currencies relative to the U.S. dollar
impact the Company’s revenues and expenses. While the Company uses financial instruments to mitigate
the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on its cash flows, unhedged exposures continue
to be subject to currency fluctuations. In addition, the weakening or strengthening of the U.S.
dollar may result in significant favorable or unfavorable translation effects when the operating
results of the Company’s non-U.S. business activity are translated into U.S. dollars.
Inflation and currency devaluation risks : The Company faces challenges in maintaining profitability
of operations in economies experiencing high inflation rates. Specifically, the Company has accounted
for operations in Argentina, Turkey and Venezuela as highly inflationary, as the prior three-year
cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. While the Company strives to maintain profit margins in
these areas through cost reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic price increases,
it might experience operating losses as a result of continued inflation. In addition, the impact of
currency devaluations in
 2023 Annual Report13 
countries experiencing high inflation rates or significant currency exchange fluctuations could
negatively impact the Company’s operating results.
Illegal importation of pharmaceutical products : The illegal importation of pharmaceutical products
from countries where government price controls or other market dynamics result in lower prices may
adversely affect the Company’s sales and profitability in the U.S. and other countries in which the
Company operates. With the exception of limited quantities of prescription drugs for personal use,
foreign imports of pharmaceutical products are illegal under current U.S. law. However, the volume of
illegal imports continues to rise as the ability of patients and other customers to obtain the lower-
priced imports has grown significantly.
Anti-bribery and other regulations : The Company is subject to various federal and foreign laws that
govern its international business practices with respect to payments to government officials. Those
laws include the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which prohibits U.S. publicly traded
companies from promising, offering, or giving anything of value to foreign officials with the corrupt
intent of influencing the foreign official for the purpose of helping the Company obtain or retain
business or gain any improper advantage. The Company’s business is heavily regulated and therefore
involves significant interaction with foreign officials. Also, in many countries outside the U.S.,
the healthcare providers who prescribe human pharmaceuticals are employed by the government and the
purchasers of human pharmaceuticals are government entities; therefore, the Company’s interactions
with these prescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the FCPA. In addition to the
U.S. application and enforcement of the FCPA, various jurisdictions in which the Company operates
have laws and regulations, including the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, aimed at preventing and penalizing
corrupt and anticompetitive behavior. Enforcement activities under these laws could subject the
Company to additional administrative and legal proceedings and actions, which could include claims
for civil penalties, criminal sanctions, and administrative remedies, including exclusion from
healthcare programs.
Other financial, economic, legal, social and political risks . Other risks inherent in conducting
business globally include:
• local and regional economic environments and policies in the markets that we serve, including
interest rates, monetary policy, inflation, economic growth, recession, commodity prices, and
currency controls or other limitations on the ability to expatriate cash;
• protective economic policies taken by governments, such as trade protection measures, increased
antitrust reporting requirements and enforcement activity, and import/export licensing requirements;
• compliance with local regulations and laws including, in some countries, regulatory requirements
restricting the Company’s ability to manufacture or sell its products in the relevant market;
• diminished protection of intellectual property and contractual rights in certain jurisdictions;
• potential nationalization or expropriation of the Company’s foreign assets;
• political or social upheavals, economic instability, repression, or human rights issues; and
• geopolitical events, including natural disasters, disruptions to markets due to war, armed
conflict, terrorism, epidemics or pandemics.
Due to the international nature of the Company's business, geopolitical or economic changes or
events, including global tensions and war, could adversely affect our business, results of operations
or financial condition.
As described above, the Company has extensive operations and business activity throughout the world.
Global tensions, conflict and/or war among any of the countries in which we conduct business or
distribute our products may result in foreign currency volatility, decreased demand for our products
in affected countries, and challenges to our global supply chain related to increased costs of
materials and other inputs for our products and suppliers. Most recently, we have experienced, and
expect to continue to experience, impacts to the Company's business resulting from the Russia-Ukraine
war, rising conflict in the Middle East as well as increasing tensions between the U.S. and China. In
response to heightened conflict, such as the Russia-Ukraine war, governments may impose export
controls and broad financial and economic sanctions. Our business and operations may be further
impacted by the imposition of trade protection measures or other policies adopted by any country that
favor domestic companies and technologies over foreign competitors. Additional sanctions or other
measures may be imposed by the global community, including but not limited to limitations on our
ability to file, prosecute and maintain patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights.
Furthermore, in some countries, such as in Russia, action may be taken that allows companies and
individuals to exploit inventions owned by patent holders from the United States and many other
countries without consent or compensation and we may not be able to prevent third parties from
practicing the Company's inventions in Russia or from selling or importing products in and into
Russia.
 14 
Weak financial performance, failure to maintain a satisfactory credit rating or disruptions in the
financial markets could adversely affect our liquidity, capital position, borrowing costs and access
to capital markets.
We currently maintain investment grade credit ratings with Moody’s Investors Service and Standard &
Poor’s Ratings Services. Rating agencies routinely evaluate us, and their ratings of our long-term
and short-term debt are based on a number of factors. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit
rating agency, whether as a result of our actions or factors which are beyond our control, can
increase the cost of borrowing under any indebtedness we may incur, reduce market capacity for our
commercial paper or require the posting of additional collateral under our derivative contracts.
There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our credit ratings, and any additional
actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings, including any announcement that
our ratings are under review for a downgrade, may have a negative impact on our liquidity, capital
position and access to capital markets.
 Other risks 
Our business depends on our ability to recruit and retain talented, highly skilled employees and a
diverse workforce.
Our continued growth requires us to recruit and retain talented employees representing diverse
backgrounds, experiences, and skill sets. The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our
industry is extremely competitive and our ability to compete depends on our ability to hire, develop
and motivate highly skilled personnel in all areas of our organization. Maintaining our brand and
reputation, as well as a diverse, equitable and inclusive work environment enables us to attract top
talent. If we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain highly skilled
workers and key leaders, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be
adversely affected. In addition, effective succession planning is important to our long-term success.
Any unsuccessful implementation of our succession plans or failure to ensure effective transfer of
knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could adversely affect our business,
financial condition, or results of operations.
Climate change or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change may negatively
affect our business and results of operations.
Climate change resulting from increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases
in the atmosphere could present risks to our operations, including an adverse impact on global
temperatures, weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural
disasters. Natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, such as a hurricane, tornado,
earthquake, wildfire or flooding, may pose physical risks to our facilities and disrupt the operation
of our supply chain. The impacts of the changing climate on water resources may result in water
scarcity, limiting our ability to access sufficient high-quality water in certain locations, which
may increase operational costs.
Concern over climate change may also result in new or additional legal or regulatory requirements
designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and/or mitigate the effects of climate change on the
environment. If such laws or regulations are more stringent than current legal or regulatory
obligations, we may experience disruption in, or an increase in the costs associated with sourcing,
manufacturing and distribution of our products, which may adversely affect our business, results of
operations or financial condition. Further, the impacts of climate change have an influence on
customer preferences, and failure to provide climate-friendly products could potentially result in
loss of market share.
An information security incident, including a cybersecurity breach, could have a negative impact on
the Company’s business or reputation.
To meet business objectives, the Company relies on both internal information technology (IT) systems
and networks, and those of third parties and their vendors, to process and store sensitive data,
including confidential research, business plans, financial information, intellectual property, and
personal data that may be subject to legal protection, and ensure the continuity of the Company’s
supply chain and operations. The extensive information security and cybersecurity threats, which
affect companies globally, pose a risk to the security and availability of these systems and
networks, including customer products that are connected to or rely on such systems and networks, and
the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the Company’s sensitive data. The Company
assesses these threats and makes investments to increase internal protection, detection, and response
capabilities, as well as ensure the Company’s third-party providers have required capabilities and
controls, to address this risk. Because of the frequently changing attack techniques, along with the
increased volume and sophistication of the attacks, there is the potential for the Company to be
adversely impacted. This impact could result in reputational, competitive, operational or other
business harm as well as financial costs and regulatory action. Also, increasing use of AI could
increase these risks. The Company maintains cybersecurity insurance in the event of an information
security or cyber incident; however, the coverage may not be sufficient to cover all financial,
legal, business or reputational losses.
 2023 Annual Report15 
As a result of increased global tensions, the Company expects there will continue to be, an increased
risk of information security or cybersecurity incidents, including cyberattacks perpetrated by
adversaries of countries where the Company maintains operations. Given the potential sophistication
of these attacks, the Company may not be able to address the threat of information security or
cybersecurity incidents proactively or implement adequate preventative measures and we may not be
able to detect and address any such disruption or security breach promptly, or at all, which could
adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. Moreover, these threats
could also impact our third-party partners resulting in compromise of the Company's IT systems,
networks and data which could negatively affect the Company.
A breach of privacy laws or unauthorized access, loss or misuse of personal data could have a
negative impact on the Company’s business or reputation.
The Company is subject to privacy and data protection laws across the globe that impose broad
compliance obligations on the collection, use, storage, access, transfer and protection of personal
data. Breach of such requirements could result in substantial fines, penalties, private right of
actions, claims and damage to our reputation and business. New privacy laws are expected in other
territories, together with greater privacy enforcement by governmental authorities globally,
particularly on data localization requirements and international data flows. The Company has
established privacy compliance programs and controls that our businesses worldwide are required to
comply with, but with many technology and data-driven initiatives being prioritized across the
Company and involving multiple vendors and third parties, there are potential risks of controls
imposed on cross border data flows, unauthorized access, and loss of personal data through internal
and external threats that could impact our business operations and research activities.
The Company may be unable to achieve some or all of the anticipated strategic and financial benefits
following the separation of Kenvue Inc. (Kenvue), including with respect to the Company’s remaining
ownership interest.
The Company incurred significant expenses in connection with the Kenvue separation (the Separation).
In addition, the Company may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits that
are expected to result from the Separation. The anticipated benefits of the Separation were based on
a number of assumptions, some of which may prove incorrect. The Company holds a 9.5% ownership
interest in Kenvue. The Company cannot predict the trading price of shares of Kenvue’s common stock
and the market value of the Kenvue shares are subject to market volatility and other factors outside
of the Company’s control. The Company intends to divest its ownership interest in Kenvue, but there
can be no assurance regarding the ultimate timing of such divestiture. Unanticipated developments
could delay, prevent or otherwise adversely affect the divestiture, including but not limited to
financial market conditions.
The Separation could result in substantial tax liability.
The Company received a private letter ruling from the IRS as to the tax-free nature of the Separation
under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Notwithstanding the private letter ruling
and opinions of tax advisors, if the IRS determines that certain steps of the transaction did not
qualify for tax-free treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the resulting tax liability to
the Company and its shareholders could be substantial. The Separation may also not qualify for tax-
free treatment in other countries around the world, and as a result may trigger substantial tax
liability to the Company.

│ Item 1C. Cybersecurity │
 Risk management and strategy 
The Company has documented cybersecurity policies and standards, assesses risks from cybersecurity
threats, and monitors information systems for potential cybersecurity issues. To protect the
Company’s information systems from cybersecurity threats, the Company uses various security tools
supporting protection, detection, and response capabilities. The Company maintains a cybersecurity
incident response plan to help ensure a timely, consistent response to actual or attempted
cybersecurity incidents impacting the Company.
The Company also identifies and assesses third-party risks within the enterprise, and through the
Company's use of third-party service providers, across a range of areas including data security and
supply chain through a structured third-party risk management program.
The Company maintains a formal information security training program for all employees that includes
training on matters such as phishing and email security best practices. Employees are also required
to complete mandatory training on data privacy.
To evaluate and enhance its cybersecurity program, the Company periodically utilizes third-party
experts to undertake maturity assessments of the Company’s information security program.
To date, the Company is not aware of any cybersecurity incident that has had or is reasonably likely
to have a material impact on the Company’s business or operations; however, because of the frequently
changing attack techniques, along with the increased volume and sophistication of the attacks, there
is the potential for the Company to be adversely impacted. This impact could result in reputational,
competitive, operational or other business harm as well as financial costs and regulatory action.
Refer to the risk factor captioned An information security incident, including a cybersecurity
breach, could have a negative impact to the Company’s business or reputation in Part I, Item 1A. Risk
factors for additional description of cybersecurity risks and potential related impacts on the
Company.
 Governance - management’s responsibility 
The Company takes a risk-based approach to cybersecurity and has implemented cybersecurity controls
designed to address cybersecurity threats and risks. The Chief Information Officer (CIO), who is a
member of the Company’s Executive Committee, and the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) are
responsible for assessing and managing cybersecurity risks, including the prevention, mitigation,
detection, and remediation of cybersecurity incidents.
The Company’s CISO, in coordination with the CIO, is responsible for leading the Company’s
cybersecurity program and management of cybersecurity risk. The current CISO has over twenty-five
years of experience in information security, and his background includes technical experience,
strategy and architecture focused roles, cyber and threat experience, and various leadership roles.
 Governance - board oversight 
The Company’s Board of Directors oversees the overall risk management process, including
cybersecurity risks, directly and through its committees. The Regulatory Compliance & Sustainability
Committee (RCSC) of the board is primarily responsible for oversight of risk from cybersecurity
threats and oversees compliance with applicable laws, regulations and Company policies related to,
among others, privacy and cybersecurity.
RCSC meetings include discussions of specific risk areas throughout the year including, among others,
those relating to cybersecurity. The CISO provides at least two updates each year to RCSC on
cybersecurity matters. These reports include an overview of the cybersecurity threat landscape, key
cybersecurity initiatives to improve the Company’s risk posture, changes in the legal and regulatory
landscape relative to cybersecurity, and overviews of certain cybersecurity incidents that have
occurred within the Company and within the industry.

 Organization and business segments 
 Description of the company and business segments 
Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) have approximately 131,900 employees worldwide
engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the
healthcare field. The Company conducts business in virtually all countries of the world with the
primary focus on products related to human health and well-being.
The Company is organized into two business segments: Innovative Medicine and MedTech. The Innovative
Medicine segment is focused on the following therapeutic areas, including Immunology, Infectious
diseases, Neuroscience, Oncology, Pulmonary Hypertension, and Cardiovascular and Metabolic diseases.
Products in this segment are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers, distributors, hospitals
and healthcare professionals for prescription use. The MedTech segment includes a broad portfolio of
products used in the Orthopaedic, Surgery, Interventional Solutions and Vision fields. These products
are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used principally in the professional
fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics.
The Executive Committee of Johnson & Johnson is the principal management group responsible for the
strategic operations and allocation of the resources of the Company. This Committee oversees and
coordinates the activities of the Innovative Medicine and MedTech business segments.
In all of its product lines, the Company competes with other companies both locally and globally,
throughout the world. Competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size
of the competing companies involved. Competition in research, involving the development and the
improvement of new and existing products and processes, is particularly significant. The development
of new and innovative products, as well as protecting the underlying intellectual property of the
Company's product portfolio, is important to the Company’s success in all areas of its business. The
competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research.
 Management’s objectives

Through the Company's expertise in Innovative Medicine and MedTech, the Company is uniquely
positioned to innovate across the full spectrum of healthcare solutions today to deliver the
breakthroughs of tomorrow, and profoundly impact health for humanity.
New products introduced within the past five years accounted for approximately 25% of 2023 sales. In
2023, $15.1 billion was invested in research and development reflecting management’s commitment to
create life-enhancing innovations and to create value through partnerships that will profoundly
impact of health for humanity.
A critical driver of the Company’s success is the diversity of its 131,900 employees worldwide.
Employees are empowered and inspired to lead with Our Credo and purpose as guides. This allows every
employee to use the Company’s reach and size to advance the Company’s purpose, and to also lead with
agility and urgency. Leveraging the extensive resources across the enterprise enables the Company to
innovate and execute with excellence. This ensures the Company can remain focused on addressing the
unmet needs of society every day and invest for an enduring impact, ultimately delivering value to

7. Management's discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition. Prior
periods disclosed herein were recast to reflect the continuing operations of the Company.
In 2023, worldwide sales increased 6.5% to $85.2 billion as compared to an increase of 1.6% in 2022.
These sales changes consisted of the following:
 Sales increase/(decrease) due to: 2023 2022 
 Volume 6.8 % 8.3 % 
 Price 0.6 -1.8 
 Currency -0.9 -4.9 
 Total 6.5 % 1.6 % 
The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures on the worldwide sales growth was a positive impact
of 1.5% in 2023 and no impact in 2022.
Sales by U.S. companies were $46.4 billion in 2023 and $42.0 billion in 2022. This represents

 2023 Annual Report25 
Immunology products achieved sales of $18.1 billion in 2023, representing an increase of 6.6% as
compared to the prior year. Increased sales of STELARA (ustekinumab) were primarily driven by patient
mix, market growth, and continued strength in Inflammatory Bowel Disease. Growth of TREMFYA
(guselkumab) was due to market growth, continued strength in PsO/PsA (Psoriasis and Psoriatic
Arthritis) and patient mix. Additionally, SIMPONI/SIMPONI ARIA growth was driven by growth outside
the U.S. Lower sales of REMICADE (infliximab) were due to biosimilar competition.
Biosimilar versions of REMICADE have been introduced in the United States and certain markets outside
the United States and additional competitors continue to enter the market. Continued infliximab
biosimilar competition will result in a further reduction in sales of REMICADE.
Sales of STELARA in the United States were approximately $7.0 billion in fiscal 2023. Third parties
have filed abbreviated Biologics License Applications with the FDA seeking approval to market
biosimilar versions of STELARA. The Company has settled certain litigation under the Biosimilar Price
Competition and Innovation Act of 2009. As a result of these settlements and other agreements with
separate third parties, the Company does not anticipate the launch of a biosimilar version of STELARA
until January 1, 2025 in the United States.
Infectious disease products sales were $4.4 billion in 2023, a decline of 18.9% as compared to the
prior year primarily driven by a decline in COVID-19 vaccine revenue and loss of exclusivity of
PREZISTA .
Neuroscience products sales were $7.1 billion in 2023, representing an increase of 3.6% as compared
to the prior year. The growth of SPRAVATO (esketamine) was driven by ongoing launches as well as
increased physician confidence and patient demand. Growth was partially offset by declines in
RISPERDAL/RISPERDAL CONSTA and the paliperidone long-acting injectables outside the U.S. due to the
XEPLION loss of exclusivity in the European Union.
Oncology products achieved sales of $17.7 billion in 2023, representing an increase of 10.5% as
compared to the prior year. Sales of DARZALEX (daratumumab) were driven by continued share gains in
all regions and market growth. Growth of ERLEADA (apalutamide) was due to continued share gains and
market growth in Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer. Sales of CARVYKTI (ciltacabtagene
autoleucel) were driven by the ongoing launch, share gains and capacity improvement. Additionally,
sales from the launch of TECVAYLI (teclistamab-cqyv) and TALVEY (talquetamab-tgvs), included in Other
Oncology, contributed to the growth. Growth was partially offset by ZYTIGA (abiraterone acetate) due
to loss of exclusivity and IMBRUVICA (ibrutinib) due to global competitive pressures.
Pulmonary Hypertension products sales were $3.8 billion, representing an increase of 11.6% as
compared to the prior year. Sales growth was due to favorable patient mix, share gains and market
growth from UPTRAVI (selexipag) and OPSUMIT (macitentan) partially offset by declines in Other
Pulmonary Hypertension.
Cardiovascular/Metabolism/Other products sales were $3.7 billion, a decline of 5.5% as compared to
the prior year. The decline of XARELTO (rivaroxaban) sales was primarily driven by unfavorable
patient mix and access changes.
The Company maintains a policy that no end customer will be permitted direct delivery of product to a
location other than the billing location. This policy impacts contract pharmacy transactions
involving non-grantee 340B covered entities for most of the Company’s drugs, subject to multiple
exceptions. Both grantee and non-grantee covered entities can maintain certain contract pharmacy
arrangements under policy exceptions. The Company has been and will continue to offer 340B discounts
to covered entities on all of its covered outpatient drugs, and it believes its policy will improve
its ability to identify inappropriate duplicate discounts and diversion prohibited by the 340B
statute. The 340B Drug Pricing Program is a U.S. federal government program requiring drug
manufacturers to provide significant discounts on covered outpatient drugs to covered entities. This
policy had discount implications which positively impacted sales to customers in 2023.

The Surgery franchise sales were $10.0 billion in 2023, representing an increase of 3.6% from 2022.
The growth in Advanced Surgery was primarily driven by Biosurgery global procedure growth and
strength of the portfolio as well as uptake of new products in Endocutters and Energy. The growth was
partially offset by competitive pressures and volume-based procurement impacts in Endocutters and
Energy. The growth in General Surgery was primarily driven by increased procedures coupled with
technology penetration and benefits from the differentiated Wound Closure portfolio.
The Orthopaedics franchise sales were $8.9 billion in 2023, representing an increase of 4.1% from
2022. The growth in hips reflects global procedure growth and continued strength of the portfolio
partially offset by volume-based procurement impacts and Russia sanctions. The growth in knees was
primarily driven by procedures, benefits from recent product additions to the ATTUNE portfolio and
pull through related to the VELYS Robotic assisted solution. This was partially offset by stocking
dynamics, primarily outside the U.S. The growth in Trauma was driven by global procedures and the
adoption of recently launched products. This was partially offset by volume-based procurement
impacts. The growth in Spine, Sports & Other was primarily driven by Digital Solutions, Shoulders,
Sports and Craniomaxillofacial products partially offset by Russia sanctions and supply constraints,
primarily outside the U.S.
The Interventional Solutions franchise achieved sales of $6.4 billion in 2023, representing an
increase of 47.7% from 2022, which includes sales from Abiomed acquired on December 22, 2022.
Electrophysiology grew by double digits due to global procedure growth, new product performance and
commercial execution. This was partially offset by the impacts of volume-based procurement in China.
Abiomed sales reflect the strength of all commercialized regions and continued adoption of Impella
5.5 and Impella RP.
The Vision franchise achieved sales of $5.1 billion in 2023, representing an increase of 4.6% from
2022. The Contact Lenses/Other growth was primarily driven by the continued strong performance in the
ACUVUE OASYS 1-Day family including recent launches and commercial execution. This was partially
offset by impacts of U.S. stocking dynamics, Russia sanctions, impacts from strategic portfolio
decisions and supply challenges. The Surgical operational growth was primarily driven by cataract
procedure growth, continued strength of recent innovations and reduction of prior year stocking
outside the U.S. This was partially offset by softer Refractive and premium IOL markets and Russia
sanctions.

• Higher milestone payments in the Innovative Medicine business
• Acquired in-process research & development asset from the Laminar acquisition in the MedTech
business in the fiscal year 2023
offset by
• Portfolio prioritization in the Innovative Medicine business
In-Process Research and Development Impairments (IPR&D): In the fiscal year 2023, the Company
recorded a charge of approximately $0.3 billion which included $0.2 billion related to market
dynamics associated with a non-strategic asset (M710) acquired as part of the acquisition of Momenta
Pharmaceuticals in 2020, In the fiscal year 2022, the Company recorded an intangible asset impairment
charge of approximately $0.8 billion related to an in-process research and development asset,
bermekimab (JnJ-77474462), an investigational drug for the treatment of Atopic Dermatitis (AD) and
Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS). Additional information regarding efficacy of the AD indication and HS
indication became available which led the Company to the decision to terminate the development of
bermekimab for both AD and HS. The Company acquired all rights to bermekimab from XBiotech, Inc. in
the fiscal year 2020.
Other (Income) Expense, Net: Other (income) expense, net is the account where the Company records

Restructuring: In the fiscal year 2023, the Company completed a prioritization of its research and
development (R&D) investment within the Innovative Medicine segment to focus on the most promising
medicines with the greatest benefit to patients. This resulted in the exit of certain programs within
therapeutic areas. The R&D program exits are primarily in infectious diseases and vaccines including
the discontinuation of its respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) adult vaccine program, hepatitis and HIV
development. The pre-tax restructuring charge of approximately $0.5 billion in the fiscal year 2023,
of which $449 million was recorded in Restructuring and $30 million was recorded in Cost of products
sold on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, included the termination of partnered and non-
partnered program costs and asset impairments.
In the fiscal year 2023, the Company initiated a restructuring program of its Orthopaedics franchise
within the MedTech segment to streamline operations by exiting certain markets, product lines and
distribution network arrangements. The pre-tax restructuring expense of $0.3 billion in the fiscal
year 2023, of which $40 million was recorded in Restructuring and $279 million was recorded in Cost
of products sold on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, primarily included inventory and
instrument charges related to market and product exits.
In 2022, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $0.4 billion related to a restructuring program of
its Global Supply Chain. The Global Supply Chain program was announced in the second quarter of 2018
and was completed in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2022.

Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Pillar Two Framework that was supported
by over 130 countries worldwide. As of December 31, 2023, several EU and non-EU countries have
enacted Pillar 2 legislation with an initial effective date of January 1, 2024, with other aspects of
the law effective in 2025 or later. The Company is estimating that as result of this legislation the
2024 effective tax rate will increase by approximately 1.5% or 150 basis points compared to fiscal
2023. Further legislation, guidance and regulations that may be issued in fiscal 2024, as well as
other business events, may impact this estimate.
For discussion related to the fiscal 2023 provision for taxes refer to Note 8 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

 $(15.8) Net cash used for financing activities 
As of December 31, 2023, the Company's notes payable and long-term debt was in excess of cash, cash
equivalents and marketable securities. As of December 31, 2023, the net debt position was $6.4
billion as compared to the prior year of $17.4 billion. The debt balance at the end of 2023 was $29.3
billion as compared to $39.6 billion in 2022. Considering recent market conditions, the Company has
re-evaluated its operating cash flows and liquidity profile and does not foresee any significant
incremental risk. The Company anticipates that operating cash flows, the ability to raise funds from
external sources, borrowing capacity from existing committed credit facilities and access to the
commercial paper markets will continue to provide sufficient resources to fund operating needs,
including the Company's remaining balance to be paid on the agreement to settle opioid litigation for
approximately $2.1 billion and the establishment of the approximately $9 billion reserve for talc
matters (See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details). In addition,
the Company monitors the global capital markets on an ongoing basis and from time to time may raise
capital when market conditions are favorable.
On May 8, 2023, Kenvue, completed an initial public offering (the IPO) resulting in the issuance of
198,734,444 shares of its common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the Kenvue Common Stock), at an
initial public offering of $22.00 per share for net proceeds of $4.2 billion. The excess of the net
proceeds from the IPO over the net book value of the Johnson & Johnson divested interest was $2.5
billion and was recorded to additional paid-in capital. As of the closing of the IPO, Johnson &
Johnson owned approximately 89.6% of the total outstanding shares of Kenvue Common Stock and at July
2, 2023, the non-controlling interest of $1.3 billion associated with Kenvue was reflected in equity
attributable to non-controlling interests in the consolidated balance sheet.
On August 23, 2023, Johnson & Johnson completed the disposition of an additional 80.1% ownership of
Kenvue Common Stock through an exchange offer, which resulted in Johnson & Johnson acquiring
190,955,436 shares of the Company’s common stock in exchange for 1,533,830,450 shares of Kenvue
Common Stock. The $31.4 billion of Johnson & Johnson common stock received in the exchange offer is
recorded in Treasury stock. Following the exchange offer, the Company owns 9.5% of the total
outstanding shares of Kenvue Common Stock that was recorded in other assets within continuing
operations at the fair market value of $4.3 billion as of August 23, 2023 and $3.9 billion as of
December 31, 2023.
Johnson & Johnson divested net assets of $11.6 billion as of August 23, 2023, and the accumulated
other comprehensive loss attributable to the Consumer Health business at that date was $4.3 billion.
Additionally, at the date of the exchange offer,
 34 
Johnson & Johnson decreased the non-controlling interest by $1.2 billion to record the
deconsolidation of Kenvue. This resulted in a gain on the exchange offer of $21.0 billion that was
recorded in Net earnings from discontinued operations, net of taxes in the consolidated statements of
earnings for the fiscal third quarter of 2023. This one-time gain includes a gain of $2.8 billion on
the Kenvue Common Stock retained by Johnson & Johnson. The gain on the exchange offer qualifies as a
tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
On September 14, 2022, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a share repurchase
program, authorizing the Company to purchase up to $5.0 billion of the Company’s Common Stock. In the
fiscal year 2022, approximately $2.5 billion was repurchased under the program. In the fiscal year
2023, $2.5 billion has been repurchased and the repurchase program was completed.
The following table summarizes the Company’s material contractual obligations and their aggregate
maturities as of December 31, 2023: To satisfy these obligations, the Company intends to use cash
from operations.

 2023 Annual Report35 
 Financing and market risk 
The Company uses financial instruments to manage the impact of foreign exchange rate changes on cash
flows. Accordingly, the Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to protect the value
of certain foreign currency assets and liabilities and to hedge future foreign currency transactions
primarily related to product costs. Gains or losses on these contracts are offset by the gains or
losses on the underlying transactions. A 10% appreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the December 31,
2023 market rates would increase the unrealized value of the Company’s forward contracts by $0.1
billion. Conversely, a 10% depreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the December 31, 2023 market rates
would decrease the unrealized value of the Company’s forward contracts by $0.1 billion. In either
scenario, the gain or loss on the forward contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the
underlying transaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated earnings and cash
flows.
The Company hedges the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and the effect on certain
assets and liabilities in foreign currency, by entering into currency swap contracts. A 1% change in
the spread between U.S. and foreign interest rates on the Company’s interest rate sensitive financial
instruments would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of the Company’s swap contracts by
approximately $1.6 billion. In either scenario, at maturity, the gain or loss on the swap contract
would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction, and therefore, would have no
impact on future anticipated cash flows.
The Company does not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Further,
the Company has a policy of only entering into contracts with parties that have at least an
investment grade credit rating. The counterparties to these contracts are major financial
institutions and there is no significant concentration of exposure with any one counterparty.
Management believes the risk of loss is remote. The Company entered into credit support agreements
(CSA) with certain derivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on respective
credit ratings and netting agreements. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional details on credit support agreements.
The Company invests in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities which carry a
degree of interest rate risk. The fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely
impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than
predicted if interest rates fall. A 1% (100 basis points) change in spread on the Company’s interest
rate sensitive investments would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of cash equivalents
and current marketable securities by less than $0.8 billion.
The Company has access to substantial sources of funds at numerous banks worldwide. In September
2023, the Company secured a new 364-day Credit Facility of $10 billion, which expires on September 5,
2024. The Company early terminated the additional 364-day revolving Credit Facility of $10 billion,
which had an expiration of November 21, 2023. Interest charged on borrowings under the credit line
agreement is based on either Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) Reference Rate or other
applicable market rate as allowed plus applicable margins. Commitment fees under the agreement are
not material.
Total borrowings at the end of 2023 and 2022 were $29.3 billion and $39.6 billion, respectively. The
decrease in the debt balance was due to the repayment of commercial paper. In 2023, net debt (cash
and current marketable securities, net of debt) was $6.4 billion compared to net debt of $17.4
billion in 2022. Total debt represented 30.0% of total capital (shareholders’ equity and total debt)
in 2023 and 34.0% of total capital in 2022. Shareholders’ equity per share at the end of 2023 was
$28.57 compared to $29.39 at year-end 2022.
A summary of borrowings can be found in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 Dividends 
The Company increased its dividend in 2023 for the 61st consecutive year. Cash dividends paid were
$4.70 per share in 2023 and $4.45 per share in 2022.
On January 2, 2024, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $1.19 per share,
payable on March 5, 2024 to shareholders of record as of February 20, 2024.

 Other information 
 Critical accounting policies and estimates 
Management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition are based on
the Company’s consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements
requires that management make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for
revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and other related disclosures. Actual results may or may not
differ from these estimates. The Company believes that the understanding of certain key accounting
policies and estimates are essential in achieving more insight into the Company’s operating results
and financial condition. These key accounting policies include revenue recognition, income taxes,
legal and self-insurance contingencies, valuation of long-lived assets, assumptions used to determine
the amounts recorded for pensions and other employee benefit plans and accounting for stock based
awards.
Revenue Recognition: The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the
terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied; generally, this occurs with the transfer of
control of the goods to customers. The Company's global payment terms are typically between 30 to 90
days. Provisions for certain rebates, sales incentives, trade promotions, coupons, product returns,
discounts to customers and governmental clawback provisions are accounted for as variable
consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales.
Product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other
market participants, as well as market conditions, including consideration of competitor pricing.
Rebates are estimated based on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend
analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served. The Company evaluates market
conditions for products or groups of products primarily through the analysis of wholesaler and other
third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as internally generated information.
Sales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products
that exhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition or other marketing matters
are specifically investigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales return accruals.
Sales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration,
destruction in the field, or in specific areas, product recall. The sales returns reserve is based on
historical return trends by product and by market as a percent to gross sales. In accordance with the
Company’s accounting policies, the Company generally issues credit to customers for returned goods.
The Company’s sales returns reserves are accounted for in accordance with the U.S. GAAP guidance for
revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales returns reserves are recorded at full sales
value. Sales returns in the Innovative Medicine segments are almost exclusively not resalable. Sales
returns for certain franchises in the MedTech segment are typically resalable but are not material.
The Company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products. The sales returns
reserve for the total Company has been less than 1.0% of annual net trade sales during the fiscal
years 2023, 2022 and 2021.
Promotional programs, such as product listing allowances are recorded in the same period as related
sales and include volume-based sales incentive programs. Volume-based incentive programs are based on
the estimated sales volumes for the incentive period and are recorded as products are sold. These
arrangements are evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be deferred or recorded as a
reduction of revenue. The Company also earns profit-share payments through collaborative arrangements
of certain products, which are included in sales to customers. Profit-share payments were less than
2.0% of the total revenues in fiscal year 2023 and less than 3.0% of the total revenues in fiscal
year 2022 and 2021 are included in sales to customers.
In addition, the Company enters into collaboration arrangements that contain multiple revenue
generating activities. Amounts due from collaborative partners for these arrangements are recognized
as each activity is performed or delivered, based on the relative selling price. Upfront fees
received as part of these arrangements are deferred and recognized over the performance period. See
Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures on collaborations.
Reasonably likely changes to assumptions used to calculate the accruals for rebates, returns and
promotions are not anticipated to have a material effect on the financial statements. The Company
currently discloses the impact of changes to assumptions in the quarterly or annual filing in which
there is a material financial statement impact.

(1) Includes reserve for customer rebates of $740 million at December 31, 2023 and $802 million at

Income Taxes: Income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable for the current year
and include the results of any difference between U.S. GAAP accounting and tax reporting, recorded as
deferred tax assets or liabilities. The Company estimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based
on enacted tax regulations and rates. Future changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded
deferred tax assets and liabilities.
The Company has unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. The Company follows U.S. GAAP,
which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement
recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
Management believes that changes in these estimates would not have a material effect on the Company's
results of operations, cash flows or financial position.
The Company has recorded deferred tax liabilities on all undistributed earnings prior to December 31,
2017 from its international subsidiaries. The Company has not provided deferred taxes on the
undistributed earnings subsequent to January 1, 2018 from certain international subsidiaries where
the earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. The Company intends to continue to
reinvest these earnings in those international operations. If the Company decides at a later date to
repatriate these earnings to the U.S., the Company would be required to provide for the net tax
effects on these amounts. The Company estimates that the tax effect of this repatriation would be
approximately $0.5 billion under currently enacted tax laws and regulations and at current currency
exchange rates. This amount does not include the possible benefit of U.S. foreign tax credits, which
may substantially offset this cost.
See Note 1 and Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding
income taxes.
Legal and Self Insurance Contingencies: The Company records accruals for various contingencies,
including legal proceedings and product liability claims as these arise in the normal course of
business. The accruals are based on management’s judgment as to the probability of losses and, where
applicable, actuarially determined estimates. The Company has self insurance through a wholly-owned
captive insurance company. In addition to accruals in the self insurance program, claims that exceed
the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated.
The Company follows the provisions of U.S. GAAP when recording litigation related contingencies. A
liability is recorded when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.
 2023 Annual Report39 
See Notes 1 and 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding product
liability and legal proceedings.
Long-Lived and Intangible Assets: The Company assesses changes, both qualitatively and
quantitatively, in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows in
evaluating the value of the Company’s property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets.
As these assumptions and estimates may change over time, it may or may not be necessary for the
Company to record impairment charges.
Employee Benefit Plans: The Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined
benefit, defined contribution and termination indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide.
These plans are based on assumptions for the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, mortality
rates, expected salary increases, healthcare cost trend rates and attrition rates. See Note 10 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on these rates.
Stock Based Compensation: The Company recognizes compensation expense associated with the issuance of
equity instruments to employees for their services. Based on the type of equity instrument, the fair
value is estimated on the date of grant using either the Black-Scholes option valuation model or a
combination of both the Black-Scholes option valuation model and Monte Carlo valuation model, and is
expensed in the financial statements over the service period. The input assumptions used in
determining fair value are the expected life, expected volatility, risk-free rate and expected
dividend yield. For performance share units, the fair market value is calculated for the two
component goals at the date of grant: adjusted operational earnings per share and relative total
shareholder return. The fair values for the earnings per share goal of each performance share unit
was estimated on the date of grant using the fair market value of the shares at the time of the
award, discounted for dividends, which are not paid on the performance share units during the vesting
period. The fair value for the relative total shareholder return goal of each performance share unit
was estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo valuation model. See Note 16 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of December 31, 2023.

 Economic and market factors 
The Company is aware that its products are used in an environment where, for more than a decade,
policymakers, consumers and businesses have expressed concerns about the rising cost of healthcare.
In response to these concerns, the Company has a long-standing policy of pricing products
responsibly. For the period 2013 - 2023, in the U.S., the weighted average compound annual growth
rate of the Company’s net price increases for healthcare products (prescription and over-the-counter
drugs, hospital and professional products) was below the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI).
The Company operates in certain countries where the economic conditions continue to present
significant challenges. The Company continues to monitor these situations and take appropriate
actions. Inflation rates continue to have an effect on worldwide economies and, consequently, on the
way companies operate. The Company has accounted for operations in Argentina, Venezuela and Turkey
(beginning in the fiscal second quarter of 2022) as highly inflationary, as the prior three-year
cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. This did not have a material impact to the Company's
results in the period. In the face of increasing costs, the Company strives to maintain its profit
margins through cost reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic price increases.
In December 2023, the Argentine government devalued the peso by approximately 50%. During 2023, the
Company recorded a charge of approximately $130 million related to operations in Argentina due to the
application of highly inflationary accounting. As of December 31, 2023, the Company’s Argentine
subsidiaries represented less than 1.0% of the Company's consolidated assets, liabilities, revenues
and profits from continuing operations; therefore, the effect of a change in the exchange rate is not
expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's 2024 full-year results.
In July 2023, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Janssen) filed litigation against the U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services as well as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services challenging the
constitutionality of the Inflation Reduction Act’s (IRA) Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program. The
litigation requests a declaration that the IRA violates Janssen’s rights under the First Amendment
and the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution and therefore that Janssen is not subject to the IRA’s
mandatory pricing scheme.
Russia-Ukraine War
Although the long-term implications of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine are difficult to predict at this
time, the financial impact of the conflict in the fiscal year 2023, including accounts receivable or
inventory reserves, was not material. As of and for each of the fiscal years ending December 31, 2023
and January 1, 2023, the business of the Company’s Russian subsidiaries represented less than 1% of
the Company’s consolidated assets and represented 1% of revenues. The Company does not maintain
Ukraine subsidiaries subsequent to the Kenvue separation.
In early March of 2022, the Company took steps to suspend all advertising, enrollment in clinical
trials, and any additional investment in Russia. The Company continues to supply products relied upon
by patients for healthcare purposes.
Conflict in the Middle East
Although the long-term implications of Israel's conflict are difficult to predict at this time, the
financial impact of the conflict in the fiscal year 2023, including accounts receivable or inventory
reserves, was not material. As of and for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2023, the business of
the Company’s Israel subsidiaries represented 1% of the Company’s consolidated assets and represented
less than 1% of revenues.
The Company is exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. A 1% change in the value of the
U.S. Dollar as compared to all foreign currencies in which the Company had sales, income or expense
in 2023 would have increased or decreased the translation of foreign sales by approximately $0.4
billion and net income by approximately $0.2 billion.
Governments around the world consider various proposals to make changes to tax laws, which may
include increasing or decreasing existing statutory tax rates. In connection with various government
initiatives, companies are required to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations
around the world, which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in other countries. A
change in statutory tax rate in any country would result in the revaluation of the Company’s deferred
tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the period in which the new tax
law is enacted. This change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the Company’s
Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The Company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the
countries where it operates. Changes to the statutory tax rate may occur at any time, and any related
expense or benefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is
enacted.
The Company faces various worldwide healthcare changes that may continue to result in pricing
pressures that include healthcare cost containment and government legislation relating to sales,
promotions, pricing and reimbursement of healthcare products.
Changes in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of healthcare products and services,
including delaying medical procedures, rationing prescription medications, reducing the frequency of
physician visits and foregoing healthcare insurance coverage may continue to impact the Company’s
businesses.
 2023 Annual Report41 
The Company also operates in an environment increasingly hostile to intellectual property rights.
Firms have filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications or Biosimilar Biological Product Applications with
the U.S. FDA or otherwise challenged the coverage and/or validity of the Company's patents, seeking
to market generic or biosimilar forms of many of the Company’s key pharmaceutical products prior to
expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. In the event the Company is not
successful in defending the patent claims challenged in the resulting lawsuits, generic or biosimilar
versions of the products at issue will be introduced to the market, resulting in the potential for
substantial market share and revenue losses for those products, and which may result in a non-cash
impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. There is also a risk that one or more
competitors could launch a generic or biosimilar version of the product at issue following regulatory
approval even though one or more valid patents are in place.
 Legal proceedings 
Johnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims
regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial, employment, indemnification and other
matters; governmental investigations; and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the
ordinary course of business.
The Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is
probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As
of December 31, 2023, the Company has determined that the liabilities associated with certain
litigation matters are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for these
matters and will continue to monitor each related legal issue and adjust accruals as might be
warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance with ASC 450-20-25,
Contingencies. For these and other litigation and regulatory matters discussed below for which a loss
is probable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of
loss beyond the amounts accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex
series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and
assumptions including timing of related payments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments
can be affected by various factors including, among other things, whether damages sought in the
proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or
is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are
significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and
unpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party
settlements; complexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties
involved. To the extent adverse awards, judgments or verdicts have been rendered against the Company,
the Company does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be
reasonably estimated.
In the Company's opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and
discussions with counsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in
the Company's balance sheet, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's
financial position. However, the resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these
matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of
operations and cash flows for that period.
See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further
information regarding legal proceedings.

 2023 Annual Report49 
 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
 1. Summary of significant accounting policies 
Principles of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries
(the Company). Intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated. Columns and rows within tables
may not add due to rounding. Percentages have been calculated using actual, non-rounded figures.
Description of the company and business segments
The Company has approximately 131,900employees worldwide engaged in the research and development,
manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the healthcare field. The Company conducts
business in virtually all countries of the world and its primary focus is on products related to
human health and well-being.
Kenvue IPO/separation and discontinued operations
On May 8, 2023, Kenvue, completed an initial public offering (the IPO) resulting in the issuance of
198,734,444shares of its common stock, par value $ 0.01per share (the “Kenvue Common Stock”), at an
initial public offering of $ 22.00per share for net proceeds of $ 4.2billion. The excess of the net
proceeds from the IPO over the net book value of the Johnson & Johnson divested interest was $
2.5billion and was recorded to additional paid-in capital. As of the closing of the IPO, Johnson &
Johnson owned approximately 89.6% of the total outstanding shares of Kenvue Common Stock and at July
2, 2023, the non-controlling interest of $ 1.3billion associated with Kenvue was reflected in equity
attributable to non-controlling interests in the consolidated balance sheet in the fiscal second
quarter of 2023.
On August 23, 2023, Johnson & Johnson completed the disposition of an additional 80.1% ownership of
the shares of Kenvue through an exchange offer. Following the exchange offer, the Company owns 9.5%
of the shares of Kenvue which are accounted for as an equity investment carried at fair value within
continuing operations. The historical results of the Consumer Health business (which previously
represented the Consumer Health business segment) are reflected as discontinued operations in the
Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements through the date of the exchange offer (see Note 21 for
additional details). Unless otherwise indicated, the information in the notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements refer only to Johnson & Johnson’s continuing operations.
Business segments
Following the completion of the exchange offer, the Company is organized into twobusiness segments:
Innovative Medicine and MedTech. The Innovative Medicine segment is focused on the following
therapeutic areas, including Immunology, Infectious diseases, Neuroscience, Oncology, Pulmonary
Hypertension, and Cardiovascular and Metabolic diseases. Products in this segment are distributed
directly to retailers, wholesalers, distributors, hospitals and healthcare professionals for
prescription use. The MedTech segment includes a broad portfolio of products used in the Orthopaedic,
Surgery, Interventional Solutions and Vision fields. These products are distributed to wholesalers,
hospitals and retailers, and used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses,
hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics.
New accounting standards
Recently adopted accounting standards
ASU 2022-04: Liabilities-Supplier Finance Programs (Topic 405-50) – Disclosure of Supplier Finance
Program Obligations
The Company adopted the standard as of the beginning of fiscal year 2023, which requires that a buyer
in a supplier finance program disclose additional information about the program for financial
statement users.
The Company has agreements for supplier finance programs with third-party financial institutions.
These programs provide participating suppliers the ability to finance payment obligations from the
Company with the third-party financial institutions. The Company is not a party to the arrangements
between the suppliers and the third-party financial institutions. The Company’s obligations to its
suppliers, including amounts due, and scheduled payment dates (which have general payment terms of 90
days), are not affected by a participating supplier’s decision to participate in the program.
 50 
As of both December 31, 2023, and January 1, 2023, $ 0.7billion were valid obligations under the
program. The obligations are presented as Accounts payableon the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Recently issued accounting standards
Not adopted as of December 31, 2023
ASU 2023-07: Segment Reporting (Topic 280) – Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures
This update requires expanded annual and interim disclosures for significant segment expenses that
are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker and included within each reported
measure of segment profit or loss. This update will be effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2023, and is to be applied retrospectively to all periods presented in the financial
statements. Early adoption is permitted. As this accounting standard only impacts disclosures, it
will not have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.
ASU 2023-09: Income Taxes (Topic 740) - Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
This update standardizes categories for the effective tax rate reconciliation, requires
disaggregation of income taxes and additional income tax-related disclosures. This update is required
to be effective for the Company for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2024. As this
accounting standard only impacts disclosures, it will not have a material impact on the Company’s
Consolidated Financial Statements.
Cash equivalents
The Company classifies all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of three months or less
from date of purchase as cash equivalents and all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of
greater than three months from the date of purchase as current marketable securities. The Company has
a policy of making investments only with commercial institutions that have at least an investment
grade credit rating. The Company invests its cash primarily in government securities and obligations,
corporate debt securities, money market funds and reverse repurchase agreements (RRAs).
RRAs are collateralized by deposits in the form of Government Securities and Obligations for an
amount not less than 102% of their value. The Company does not record an asset or liability as the
Company is not permitted to sell or repledge the associated collateral. The Company has a policy that
the collateral has at least an A (or equivalent) credit rating. The Company utilizes a third party
custodian to manage the exchange of funds and ensure that collateral received is maintained at 102%
of the value of the RRAs on a daily basis. RRAs with stated maturities of greater than three months
from the date of purchase are classified as marketable securities.
Investments
Investments classified as held to maturity investments are reported at amortized cost and realized
gains or losses are reported in earnings. Investments classified as available-for-sale debt
securities are carried at estimated fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded as a
component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Available-for-sale securities available for
current operations are classified as current assets; otherwise, they are classified as long term.
Management determines the appropriate classification of its investment in debt and equity securities
at the time of purchase and re-evaluates such determination at each balance sheet date. The Company
reviews its investments for impairment and adjusts these investments to fair value through earnings,
as required.
Property, plant and equipment and depreciation
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. The Company utilizes the straight-line method of
depreciation over the estimated useful lives of the assets:
 Building and building equipment 30years 
 Land and leasehold improvements 10-20years 
 Machinery and equipment 2-13years 
The Company capitalizes certain computer software and development costs, included in machinery and
equipment, when incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal
use. Capitalized software costs are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the software, which
generally range from 3to 8years.
The Company reviews long-lived assets to assess recoverability using undiscounted cash flows. When
certain events or changes in operating or economic conditions occur, an impairment assessment may be
performed on the recoverability of the
 2023 Annual Report51 
carrying value of these assets. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based
on the difference between the asset’s fair value and its carrying value. If quoted market prices are
not available, the Company will estimate fair value using a discounted value of estimated future cash
flows.
Revenue recognition
The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a contract with
the customer are satisfied; generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of the goods to
customers. The Company's global payment terms are typically between 30 to 90 days. Provisions for
certain rebates, sales incentives, trade promotions, coupons, product returns, discounts to customers
and governmental clawback provisions are accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as a
reduction in sales. The liability is recognized within Accrued rebates, returns, and promotions on
the consolidated balance sheet.
Product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other
market participants, as well as market conditions, including consideration of competitor pricing.
Rebates are estimated based on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend
analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served. A significant portion of the
liability related to rebates is from the sale of the Company's pharmaceutical products within the
U.S., primarily the Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid programs, which amounted to $ 11.5billion and
$ 9.6billion as of December 31, 2023 and January 1, 2023, respectively. The Company evaluates market
conditions for products or groups of products primarily through the analysis of wholesaler and other
third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as internally generated information.
Sales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products
that exhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition or other marketing matters
are specifically investigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales return accruals.
Sales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration,
destruction in the field, or in specific areas, product recall. The sales returns reserve is based on
historical return trends by product and by market as a percent to gross sales. In accordance with the
Company’s accounting policies, the Company generally issues credit to customers for returned goods.
The Company’s sales returns reserves are accounted for in accordance with the U.S. GAAP guidance for
revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales returns reserves are recorded at full sales
value. Sales returns in the Innovative Medicine segments are almost exclusively not resalable. Sales
returns for certain franchises in the MedTech segment are typically resalable but are not material.
The Company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products. The sales returns
reserve for the total Company has been less than 1.0% of annual net trade sales during each of the
fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021.
Promotional programs, such as product listing allowances are recorded in the same period as related
sales and include volume-based sales incentive programs. Volume-based incentive programs are based on
the estimated sales volumes for the incentive period and are recorded as products are sold. These
arrangements are evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be deferred or recorded as a
reduction of revenue. The Company also earns profit-share payments through collaborative arrangements
of certain products, which are included in sales to customers. Profit-share payments were less than
2.0% of the total revenues in fiscal year 2023 and less than 3.0% of the total revenues in the fiscal
years 2022 and 2021 and are included in sales to customers.
See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further disaggregation of revenue.
Shipping and handling
Shipping and handling costs incurred were $ 0.9billion, $ 0.8billion and $ 0.8billion in fiscal years
2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and are included in selling, marketing and administrative expense.
The amount of revenue received for shipping and handling is less than 1.0% of sales to customers for
all periods presented.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value determined by the first-in,
first-out method.
Intangible assets and goodwill
The authoritative literature on U.S. GAAP requires that goodwill and intangible assets with
indefinite lives be assessed annually for impairment. The Company completed its annual impairment
test for 2023 in the fiscal fourth quarter. Future impairment
 52 
tests will be performed annually in the fiscal fourth quarter, or sooner if warranted. Purchased in-
process research and development is accounted for as an indefinite lived intangible asset until the
underlying project is completed, at which point the intangible asset will be accounted for as a
definite lived intangible asset. If warranted the purchased in-process research and development could
be written off or partially impaired depending on the underlying program.
Intangible assets that have finite useful lives continue to be amortized over their useful lives, and
are reviewed for impairment when warranted by economic conditions. See Note 5 for further details on
Intangible Assets and Goodwill.
Financial instruments
As required by U.S. GAAP, all derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value.
Fair value is the exit
price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability. Fair value is a
market-based measurement determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing
an asset or liability. The authoritative literature establishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize
the inputs used in measuring fair value, with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having
the lowest. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or
other comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative is designated as part of a hedge
transaction, and if so, the type of hedge transaction.
The Company documents all relationships between hedged items and derivatives. The overall risk
management strategy includes reasons for undertaking hedge transactions and entering into
derivatives. The objectives of this strategy are: (1) minimize foreign currency exposure’s impact on
the Company’s financial performance; (2) protect the Company’s cash flow from adverse movements in
foreign exchange rates; (3) ensure the appropriateness of financial instruments; and (4) manage the
enterprise risk associated with financial institutions. See Note 6 for additional information on
Financial Instruments.
Leases
The Company determines whether an arrangement is a lease at contract inception by establishing if the
contract conveys the right to control the use of identified property, plant, or equipment for a
period of time in exchange for consideration. Right of Use (ROU) Assets and Lease Liabilities for
operating leases are included in Other assets, Accrued liabilities, and Other liabilitieson the
consolidated balance sheet. The ROU Assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the
lease term and lease liabilities represent an obligation to make lease payments arising from the
lease. Commitments under finance leases are not significant, and are included in Property, plant and
equipment, Loans and notes payable, and Long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheet.
ROU Assets and Lease Liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present
value of all minimum lease payments over the lease term. The Company uses its incremental borrowing
rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of
lease payments, when the implicit rate is not readily determinable. Lease terms may include options
to extend or terminate the lease. These options are included in the lease term when it is reasonably
certain that the Company will exercise that option. Operating lease expense is recognized on a
straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company has elected the following policy elections on
adoption: use of portfolio approach on leases of assets under master service agreements, exclusion of
short term leases on the balance sheet, and not separating lease and non-lease components.
The Company primarily has operating lease for space, vehicles, manufacturing equipment and data
processing equipment.The ROU asset pertaining to leases from continuing operation was $ 1.0billion in
both fiscal years 2023 and 2022. The lease liability from continuing operations was $ 1.1billion in
both fiscal years 2023 and 2022. The operating lease costs from continuing operations were $
0.2billion in fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021. Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of
lease liabilities from continuing operations were $ 0.2billion in fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021.
Product liability
Accruals for product liability claims are recorded, on an undiscounted basis, when it is probable
that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based
on existing information and actuarially determined estimates where applicable. The accruals are
adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available. The Company accrues an estimate of
the legal defense costs needed to defend each matter when those costs are probable and can be
reasonably estimated. To the extent adverse verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the
Company does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably
estimated.
 2023 Annual Report53 
The Company has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. In addition to
accruals in the self insurance program, claims that exceed the insurance coverage are accrued when
losses are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated.
Research and development
Research and development expenses are expensed as incurred in accordance with ASC 730, Research and
Development. Upfront and milestone payments made to third parties in connection with research and
development collaborations are expensed as incurred up to the point of regulatory approval. Payments
made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the
remaining useful life of the related product. Amounts capitalized for such payments are included in
other intangibles, net of accumulated amortization.
The Company enters into collaborative arrangements, typically with other pharmaceutical or
biotechnology companies, to develop and commercialize drug candidates or intellectual property. These
arrangements typically involve two (or more) parties who are active participants in the collaboration
and are exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of the
activities. These collaborations usually involve various activities by one or more parties, including
research and development, marketing and selling and distribution. Often, these collaborations require
upfront, milestone and royalty or profit share payments, contingent upon the occurrence of certain
future events linked to the success of the asset in development. Amounts due from collaborative
partners related to development activities are generally reflected as a reduction of research and
development expense because the performance of contract development services is not central to the
Company’s operations. In general, the income statement presentation for these collaborations is as
follows:
 Nature/Type of Collaboration Statement of Earnings Presentation 
 Third-party sale of product & profit Sales to customers 
 share payments received 
 Royalties/milestones paid to 
 collaborative partner (post-regulatory Cost of products sold 
 approval)* 
 Royalties received from collaborative Other income (expense), net 
 partner 
 Upfront payments & milestones paid to 
 collaborative partner (pre-regulatory Research and development expense 
 approval) 
 Research and development payments to Research and development expense 
 collaborative partner 
 Research and development payments 
 received from collaborative partner or Reduction of Research and development expense 
 government entity 
* Milestones are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized to cost of products sold over the
useful life.
For all years presented, there was no individual project that represented greater than 5% of the
total annual consolidated research and development expense.
The Company has a number of products and compounds developed in collaboration with strategic partners
including XARELTO, co-developed with Bayer HealthCare AG and IMBRUVICA, developed in collaboration
and co-marketed with Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie company.
Separately, the Company has a number of licensing arrangements for products and compounds including
DARZALEX, licensed from Genmab A/S.
Advertising
Costs associated with advertising are expensed in the year incurred and are included in selling,
marketing and administrative expenses. Advertising expenses worldwide, which comprised television,
radio, print media and Internet advertising, were $ 0.5billion, $ 0.7billion and $ 1.2billion in
fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Income taxes
Income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable for the current year and include the
results of any difference between U.S. GAAP accounting and tax reporting, recorded as deferred tax
assets or liabilities. The Company
 54 
estimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based on enacted tax regulations and rates. Future
changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future.
The Company has unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. The Company follows U.S. GAAP
which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement
recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
Management believes that changes in these estimates would not have a material effect on the Company's
results of operations, cash flows or financial position.
In 2017, the United States enacted into law new U.S. tax legislation, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
(TCJA). This law included provisions for a comprehensive overhaul of the corporate income tax code,
including a reduction of the statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective on January 1,
2018. The TCJA included a provision for a tax on all previously undistributed earnings of U.S.
companies located in foreign jurisdictions. Undistributed earnings in the form of cash and cash
equivalents were taxed at a rate of 15.5% and all other earnings were taxed at a rate of 8.0%. This
tax is payable over 8 years and will not accrue interest. These payments began in 2018 and will
continue through 2025. The remaining balance at the end of the 2023 was approximately $ 4.5billion,
of which $ 2.5billion is classified as noncurrent and reflected as “Long-term taxes payable” on the
Company’s balance sheet.
The TCJA also includes provisions for a tax on global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI). GILTI is
described as the excess of a U.S. shareholder’s total net foreign income over a deemed return on
tangible assets, as provided by the TCJA. In January 2018, the FASB issued guidance that allows
companies to elect as an accounting policy whether to record the tax effects of GILTI in the period
the tax liability is generated (i.e., “period cost”) or provide for deferred tax assets and
liabilities related to basis differences that exist and are expected to effect the amount of GILTI
inclusion in future years upon reversal (i.e., “deferred method”). The Company has elected to account
for GILTI under the deferred method. The deferred tax amounts recorded are based on the evaluation of
temporary differences that are expected to reverse as GILTI is incurred in future periods.
The Company has recorded deferred tax liabilities on all undistributed earnings prior to December 31,
2017 from its international subsidiaries. The Company has not provided deferred taxes on the
undistributed earnings subsequent to January 1, 2018 from certain international subsidiaries where
the earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. The Company intends to continue to
reinvest these earnings in those international operations. If the Company decides at a later date to
repatriate these earnings to the U.S., the Company would be required to provide for the net tax
effects on these amounts. The Company estimates that the tax effect of this repatriation would be
approximately $ 0.5billion under currently enacted tax laws and regulations and at current currency
exchange rates. This amount does not include the possible benefit of U.S. foreign tax credits, which
may substantially offset this cost.
See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding income taxes.
Net earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings available to common shareholders by the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share
reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities were exercised or converted into
common stock using the treasury stock method.
Use of estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
amounts reported. Estimates are used when accounting for sales discounts, rebates, allowances and
incentives, product liabilities, income taxes, withholding taxes, depreciation, amortization,
employee benefits, contingencies and intangible asset and liability valuations. Actual results may or
may not differ from those estimates.
The Company follows the provisions of U.S. GAAP when recording litigation related contingencies. A
liability is recorded when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. The best estimate of a
loss within a range is accrued; however, if no estimate in the range is better than any other, the
minimum amount is accrued.
Annual closing date
The Company follows the concept of a fiscal year, which ends on the Sunday nearest to the end of the
month of December. Normally each fiscal year consists of 52 weeks, but every five or six years the
fiscal year consists of 53 weeks, and therefore includes additional shipping days, as was the case in
fiscal year 2020, and will be the case again in fiscal year 2026.

See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to acquisitions
and divestitures.

 6. Fair value measurements 
The Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to manage its exposure to the variability of cash
flows, primarily related to the foreign exchange rate changes of future intercompany products and
third-party purchases of materials denominated in a foreign currency. The Company uses cross currency
interest rate swaps to manage currency risk primarily related to borrowings. Both types of
derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges.
Additionally, the Company primarily uses interest rate swaps as an instrument to manage interest rate
risk related to fixed rate borrowings. These derivatives are designated as fair value hedges. The
Company uses cross currency interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts designated as
net investment hedges. Additionally, the Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to offset
its exposure to certain foreign currency assets and liabilities. These forward foreign exchange
contracts are not designated as hedges and therefore, changes in the fair values of these derivatives
are recognized in earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the related foreign
currency assets and liabilities.
The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes,
or that contain credit risk related contingent features. The Company maintains credit support
agreements (CSA) with certain derivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on
respective credit ratings and netting agreements. As of December 31, 2023 and January 1, 2023, the
total amount of cash collateral paid by the Company under the CSA amounted to $ 4.0billion and $
0.8billion net respectively, related to net investment and cash flow hedges. On an ongoing basis, the
Company monitors counter-party credit ratings. The Company considers credit non-performance risk to
be low, because the Company primarily enters into agreements with commercial institutions that have
at least an investment grade credit rating. Refer to the table on significant financial assets and
liabilities measured at fair value contained in this footnote for receivables and payables with these
commercial institutions. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had notional amounts outstanding for
forward foreign exchange contracts, cross currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps of $
42.9billion, $ 39.7billion and $ 10.0billion, respectively. As of January 1, 2023, the Company had
notional amounts outstanding for forward foreign exchange contracts, cross currency interest rate
swaps and interest rate swaps of $ 41.5billion, $ 36.2billion and $ 10.0billion, respectively.
All derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value
of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending
on whether the derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge
transaction.
The designation as a cash flow hedge is made at the entrance date of the derivative contract. At
inception, all derivatives are expected to be highly effective. Foreign exchange contracts designated
as cash flow hedges are accounted for under the forward method and all gains/losses associated with
these contracts will be recognized in the income statement when the hedged item impacts earnings.
Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income
until the underlying transaction affects earnings, and are then reclassified to earnings in the same
account as the hedged transaction.
Gains and losses associated with interest rate swaps and changes in fair value of hedged debt
attributable to changes in interest rates are recorded to interest expense in the period in which
they occur. Gains and losses on net investment hedges are accounted through the currency translation
account within accumulated other comprehensive income. The portion excluded from effectiveness
testing is recorded through interest (income) expense using the spot method. On an ongoing basis, the
Company assesses whether each derivative continues to be highly effective in offsetting changes of
hedged items. If and when a derivative is no longer expected to be highly effective, hedge accounting
is discontinued.
The Company designated its Euro denominated notes issued in May 2016 with due dates ranging from 2022
to 2035 as a net investment hedge of the Company's investments in certain of its international
subsidiaries that use the Euro as their functional currency in order to reduce the volatility caused
by changes in exchange rates.
As of December 31, 2023, the balance of deferred net loss on derivatives included in accumulated
other comprehensive income was $ 377million after-tax. For additional information, see the
Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and Note 13. The Company expects that substantially
all of the amounts related to forward foreign exchange contracts will be reclassified into earnings
over the next 12 monthsas a result of transactions that are expected to occur over that period. The
maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging transaction exposure is 18months, excluding
interest rate contracts and net investment hedges. The amount ultimately realized in earnings may
differ as foreign exchange rates change. Realized gains and losses are ultimately determined by
actual exchange rates at maturity of the derivative.

For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023 and January 1, 2023 for equity investments without
readily determinable market values, $ 1million and $ 51million, respectively, of the changes in fair
value reflected in net income were the result of impairments. There were offsetting impacts of $
27million and $ 142million, respectively, of changes in the fair value reflected in net income due to
changes in observable prices and gains on the disposal of investments.
Fair value is the exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability.
Fair value is a market-based measurement determined using assumptions that market participants would
use in pricing an asset or liability. In accordance with ASC 820, a three-level hierarchy to
prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels within the hierarchy are described
below with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest.
The fair value of a derivative financial instrument (i.e., forward foreign exchange contracts,
interest rate contracts) is the aggregation by currency of all future cash flows discounted to its
present value at the prevailing market interest rates and subsequently converted to the U.S. Dollar
at the current spot foreign exchange rate. The Company does not believe that fair values of these
derivative instruments materially differ from the amounts that could be realized upon settlement or
maturity, or that the changes in fair value will have a material effect on the Company’s results of
operations, cash flows or financial position. The Company also holds equity investments which are
classified as Level 1 and debt securities which are classified as Level 2. The Company holds
acquisition related contingent liabilities based upon certain regulatory and commercial events, which
are classified as Level 3, whose values are determined using discounted cash flow methodologies or
similar techniques for which the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or
estimations.
The following three levels of inputs are used to measure fair value:
Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
Level 2 — Significant other observable inputs.
Level 3 — Significant unobservable inputs.

Fair value of the long-term debt was estimated using market prices, which were corroborated by quoted
broker prices and significant other observable inputs.
The Company has access to substantial sources of funds at numerous banks worldwide. In September
2023, the Company secured a new 364-day Credit Facility of $ 10billion, which expires on September 5,
2024. The Company early terminated the additional 364-day revolving Credit Facility of $ 10billion,
which had an expiration of November 21, 2023. Interest charged on borrowings under the credit line
agreement is based on either the Term SOFR Reference Rate or other applicable market rates as allowed
under the terms of the agreement, plus applicable margins. Commitment fees under the agreements are
not material.
Throughout fiscal years 2023 and 2022, the Company continued to have access to liquidity through the
commercial paper market. Short-term borrowings and the current portion of long-term debt amounted to
approximately $ 3.5billion and $ 12.8billion at the end of fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively.
The current portion of the long term debt was $ 1.5billion and $ 1.6billion in 2023 and 2022,
respectively, and the remainder is commercial paper and local borrowing by international
subsidiaries.
The current debt balance as of December 31, 2023 includes $ 2.0billion of commercial paper which has
a weighted average interest rate of 5.37% and a weighted average maturity of approximately two
months. The current debt balance as of January 1, 2023 includes $ 11.2billion of commercial paper
which has a weighted average interest rate of 4.23% and a weighted average maturity of approximately
two months.

(1) International operations reflect the impacts of operations in jurisdictions with statutory tax
rates different than the U.S., particularly Ireland, Switzerland, Belgium and Puerto Rico, which is a
favorable impact on the effective tax rate as compared with the U.S. statutory rate.
(2) Includes the impact of the GILTI tax, the Foreign-Derived Intangible Income deduction and other
foreign income that is taxable under the U.S. tax code. The 2023 and 2022 amount includes the impact
of certain provisions of the 2017 TCJA that became effective in fiscal 2022. The 2023 amount includes
the impact of certain foreign subsidiaries deferred tax remeasurements for legislative elections and
the 2021 amounts include the reorganization of international subsidiaries further described below.
The fiscal year 2023 effective tax rate decreased 3.9% as compared to the fiscal year 2022 effective
tax rate as the Company recorded certain non-recurring favorable tax items in fiscal year 2023 when
compared to the prior fiscal year.
In the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023, the Company settled the U.S. Internal Revenue Service audit for
tax years 2013 through 2016 which resulted in a favorable impact to the rate of 3.0%. This settlement
was partially offset by the Company recording a $ 0.4billion decrease in expected U.S. foreign tax
credits , an unfavorable effective rate impact of 2.6% , which has been reflected as a current tax
expense in U.S. taxes on international income on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation.
In the fiscal year 2023, the Company had certain non-recurring impacts as a result of legislative tax
elections made in certain international subsidiaries which resulted in a change in the Company’s tax
basis in certain assets resulting in deferred tax re-measurements. The net impact of these non-
recurring items is a net benefit of 3.4% to the Company’s annual effective tax rate, comprised of the
following items:
• approximately $ 0.3billion of tax benefit on local deferred tax assets to record the remeasurement
of the increased tax basis, this benefit has been reflected as International operations on the
Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation. This benefit was offset by approximately $ 0.1billion of
U.S. deferred tax expense on the GILTI deferred tax liability resulting from the remeasurement of
these deferred tax assets. This has been reflected in the “U.S. tax on international income” on the
Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation.
• approximately $ 0.3billion of U.S. deferred tax benefit on the GILTI deferred tax as a result of an
international subsidiary making an election to change the treatment of a local deferred tax asset to
a refundable tax credit. This has been reflected in the U.S. taxes on international income on the
Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation.
The Company’s 2023 and 2022 tax rates benefited from certain provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
of 2017 that became effective in fiscal 2022. The Company also had lower income in higher tax
jurisdictions vs. fiscal year 2022, primarily in the U.S. where the Company recorded an approximately
$ 7.0billion charge related to talc matters in the United States at an effective tax rate of 21.1%
(for further information see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
The fiscal year 2022 effective tax rate increased 8.2% as compared to the fiscal year 2021 effective
tax rate as the Company recorded certain non-recurring favorable tax items in fiscal year 2021 which
resulted in an unfavorable impact to the Company’s fiscal 2022 effective tax rate when compared to
the prior fiscal year. These items are described below. The Company’s 2022 tax rate also benefited
from the impairment of bermekimab for AD IPR&D and changes in the fair value of securities in the
Company’s investment portfolio, both recorded at the U.S. statutory rate.
 2023 Annual Report67 
In the fiscal year 2021, the Company reorganized the ownership structure of certain wholly-owned
international subsidiaries. As part of this reorganization, the Company increased the tax basis of
certain assets to fair value in accordance with applicable local regulations. The net impact of this
restructuring was approximately $ 0.6billion net benefit or 3.2% benefit to the Company’s annual
effective tax rate, comprised of the following items:
• approximately $ 2.3billion of local deferred tax assets to record the remeasurement of the tax
basis of these assets to fair value, this benefit has been reflected as International operations on
the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation.
• approximately $ 1.7billion of U.S. deferred tax expense relating to the GILTI deferred tax
liability resulting from the remeasurement of these deferred tax assets. This expense has been
reflected as U.S. taxes on international income on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation.
Also, in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2021, the Company recognized a loss on certain U.S. affiliates
related to the previously impaired book value of certain intangibles, which reduced the 2021
effective tax rate by approximately 1.6% which is reflected as a Tax benefits from loss on capital
assets on the effective tax rate reconciliation. Additionally other fiscal 2021 impacts to the rate
were primarily driven by litigation and acquisition related items as follows:
• the Company accrued additional legal expenses, of approximately $ 1.6billion for talc at an
effective tax rate of 23.5% and $ 0.8billion for Risperdal Gynecomastia settlements at an effective
tax rate of 16.4% (See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details).
• the Company recorded a partial IPR&D charge of $ 0.9billion for the Ottava intangible asset
(acquired with the Auris Health acquisition in 2019) at an effective rate of 22.4%.

(1) In fiscal 2023, the Company changed the presentation of income taxes accrued on intercompany
profits on inventory still owned by the Company as part of “Prepaid expenses and other” on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet.
(2) Net of valuation allowances of $ 1.1billion and $ 0.8billion in 2023 and 2022. The change in the
valuation allowance from 2022 to 2023 was driven by approximately $ 0.1billion from acquisition
related activity and the remainder was due to normal operations during the fiscal year.
The Company has wholly-owned international subsidiaries that have cumulative net losses. The Company
believes that it is more likely than not that these subsidiaries will generate future taxable income
sufficient to utilize these deferred tax assets. However, in certain jurisdictions, valuation
allowances have been recorded against deferred tax assets for loss carryforwards that are not more
likely than not to be realized.
The following table summarizes the activity related to unrecognized tax benefits for continuing
operations:

 End of year $2,485 3,716 3,210 
As of December 31, 2023 the Company had approximately $ 2.5billion of unrecognized tax benefits. The
Company conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and currently has tax audits in
progress with a number of tax authorities. With respect to the United States the Internal Revenue
Service has completed its audit for all tax years through 2016.
In other major jurisdictions where the Company conducts business, the years that remain open to tax
audits go back to the year 2008. The Company believes it is possible that some tax audits may be
completed over the next twelve months by taxing authorities in some jurisdictions, including in the
United States. However, the Company is not able to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the
timing of any other future tax payments or change in uncertain tax positions, if any.
The Company classifies liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties
as long-term liabilities. Interest expense and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are
classified as income tax expense. The Company recognized after tax interest expense of $ 99million, $
136million and $ 42million in fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The total amount of
accrued interest was $ 264million and $ 637million in fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively.

 10. Pensions and other benefit plans 
The Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit, defined
contribution and termination indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide. The Company also
provides post-retirement benefits, primarily healthcare, to all eligible U.S. retired employees and

Many international employees are covered by government-sponsored programs and the cost to the Company
is not significant.
In the U.S, non-union pension benefits for employees hired before January 1, 2015 are primarily based
on the employee’s compensation during the last five yearsbefore retirement and the number of years of
service (the Final Average Pay formula). U.S. pension benefits for employees hired after 2014, are
calculated using a different formula based on employee compensation over total years of service (the
Retirement Value formula).
In January 2021, the Company announced that, effective on January 1, 2026, all eligible U.S. non-
union employees, regardless of hire date, will earn benefits under the Retirement Value formula. This
amendment does not affect the benefits accrued under the Final Average Pay formula for service before
January 1, 2026.
International subsidiaries have plans under which funds are deposited with trustees, annuities are
purchased under group contracts, or reserves are provided.
The Company does not fund retiree healthcare benefits in advance and has the right to modify these
plans in the future.
In 2023 and 2022 the Company used December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, as the
measurement date for all U.S. and international retirement and other benefit plans.
Net periodic benefit costs for the Company’s defined benefit retirement plans and other benefit plans
for 2023, 2022 and 2021 include the following components:

The service cost component of net periodic benefit cost is presented in the same line items on the
Consolidated Statement of Earnings where other employee compensation costs are reported, including
Cost of products sold, Research and development expense, Selling, marketing and administrative
expenses, and Net earnings from discontinued operations, net of taxes if related to the separation of
Kenvue. All other components of net periodic benefit cost are presented as part of Other (income)
expense, net on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, with the exception of certain amounts for
curtailments and settlements, which are reported in Net earnings from discontinued operations, net of
taxes if related to the separation of Kenvue (as noted above).
Unrecognized gains and losses for the U.S. pension plans are amortized over the average remaining
future service for each plan. For plans with no active employees, they are amortized over the average
life expectancy. The amortization of gains and losses for the other U.S. benefit plans is determined
by using a 10% corridor of the greater of the market value of assets or the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation. Total unamortized gains and losses in excess of the corridor are
amortized over the average remaining future service.
Prior service costs/benefits for the U.S. pension plans are amortized over the average remaining
future service of plan participants at the time of the plan amendment. Prior service cost/benefit for
the other U.S. benefit plans is amortized over the average remaining service to full eligibility age
of plan participants at the time of the plan amendment.

The Company’s discount rates are determined by considering current yield curves representing high
quality, long-term fixed income instruments. The resulting discount rates are consistent with the
duration of plan liabilities. The Company's methodology in determining service and interest cost uses
duration specific spot rates along that yield curve to the plans' liability cash flows.
The expected rates of return on plan asset assumptions represent the Company's assessment of long-
term returns on diversified investment portfolios globally. The assessment is determined using
projections from external financial sources, long-term historical averages, actual returns by asset
class and the various asset class allocations by market.

The Company plans to continue to fund its U.S. Qualified Plans to comply with the Pension Protection
Act of 2006. International Plans are funded in accordance with local regulations. Additional
discretionary contributions are made when deemed appropriate to meet the long-term obligations of the
plans. For certain plans, funding is not a common practice, as funding provides no economic benefit.
Consequently, the Company has several pension plans that are not funded.
In 2023, the Company contributed $ 135million and $ 133million to its U.S. and international pension
plans, respectively.
The following table displays the funded status of the Company's U.S. Qualified & Non-Qualified
pension plans and international funded and unfunded pension plans at December 31, 2023 and December

Each pension plan is overseen by a local committee or board that is responsible for the overall
administration and investment of the pension plans. In determining investment policies, strategies
and goals, each committee or board considers factors including, local pension rules and regulations;
local tax regulations; availability of investment vehicles (separate accounts, commingled accounts,
insurance funds, etc.); funded status of the plans; ratio of actives to retirees; duration of
liabilities; and other relevant factors including: diversification, liquidity of local markets and
liquidity of base currency. A majority of the Company’s pension funds are open to new entrants and
are expected to be on-going plans. Permitted investments are primarily liquid and/or listed, with
little reliance on illiquid and non-traditional investments such as hedge funds.
The Company’s retirement plan asset allocation at the end of 2023 and 2022 and target allocations for
2024 are as follows:
 2023 Annual Report73 
 Percent of Target 
 Plan Assets Allocation

 Worldwide Retirement Plans 
 Equity securities 58 % 62 % 58 % 
 Debt securities 42 38 42 
 Total plan assets 100 % 100 % 100 % 
Determination of fair value of plan assets
The Plan has an established and well-documented process for determining fair values. Fair value is
based upon quoted market prices, where available. If listed prices or quotes are not available, fair
value is based upon models that primarily use, as inputs, market-based or independently sourced
market parameters, including yield curves, interest rates, volatilities, equity or debt prices,
foreign exchange rates and credit curves.
While the Plan believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market
participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of
certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting
date.
Valuation hierarchy
The authoritative literature establishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in
measuring fair value. The levels within the hierarchy are described in the table below with Level 1
having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest.
The Net Asset Value (NAV) is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund, minus its
liabilities, and then divided by the number of shares outstanding.
A financial instrument’s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level
of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the investments measured at fair
value.
• Short-term investment funds — Cash and quoted short-term instruments are valued at the closing
price or the amount held on deposit by the custodian bank. Other investments are through investment
vehicles valued using the NAV provided by the administrator of the fund. The NAV is a quoted price in
a market that is not active and classified as Level 2.
• Government and agency securities — A limited number of these investments are valued at the closing
price reported on the major market on which the individual securities are traded. Where quoted prices
are available in an active market, the investments are classified within Level 1 of the valuation
hierarchy. If quoted market prices are not available for the specific security, then fair values are
estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or
discounted cash flows. When quoted market prices for a security are not available in an active
market, they are classified as Level 2.
• Debt instruments — A limited number of these investments are valued at the closing price reported
on the major market on which the individual securities are traded. Where quoted prices are available
in an active market, the investments are classified as Level 1. If quoted market prices are not
available for the specific security, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted
prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows and are classified as
Level 2. Level 3 debt instruments are priced based on unobservable inputs.
• Equity securities — Equity securities are valued at the closing price reported on the major market
on which the individual securities are traded. Substantially all equity securities are classified
within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.
• Commingled funds — These investment vehicles are valued using the NAV provided by the fund
administrator. Assets in the Level 2 category have a quoted market price.
• Other assets — Other assets are represented primarily by limited partnerships. These investment
vehicles are valued using the NAV provided by the fund administrator. Other assets that are exchange
listed and actively traded are classified as Level 1, while inactively traded assets are classified
as Level 2.

Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.
Details on reclassifications out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income:
Gain/(Loss) On Securities - reclassifications released to Other (income) expense, net.
Employee Benefit Plans - reclassifications are included in net periodic benefit cost. See Note 10 for
additional details.
Gain/(Loss) On Derivatives & Hedges - reclassifications to earnings are recorded in the same account
as the hedged transaction. See Note 6 for additional details.
* Includes impact of curtailments and settlements in connection with separation from Kenvue.
 14. International currency translation 
For translation of its subsidiaries operating in non-U.S. Dollar currencies, the Company has
determined that the local currencies of its international subsidiaries are the functional currencies
except those in highly inflationary economies, which are defined as those which have had compound
cumulative rates of inflation of 100% or more during the past three years, or where a substantial
portion of its cash flows are not in the local currency. For the majority of the Company's
subsidiaries the local currency is the functional currency.
In consolidating international subsidiaries, balance sheet currency effects are recorded as a
component of accumulated other comprehensive income. The other current and non-current assets line
within the Statement of Cash flows includes the impact of foreign currency translation. This equity
account includes the results of translating certain balance sheet assets and liabilities at current
exchange rates and some accounts at historical rates, except for those located in highly inflationary
economies (Argentina and Venezuela). Beginning in the fiscal second quarter of 2022, the Company also
accounted for operations in Turkey as highly inflationary. The translation of balance sheet accounts
for highly inflationary economies are reflected in the operating results.
A rollforward of the changes during fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021 for foreign currency translation
adjustments is included in Note 13.
Net currency transaction gains and losses included in Other (income) expense were losses of $
366million, $ 286million and $ 216million in fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

The diluted net earnings per share calculation for fiscal year 2023 excluded 43million shares related
to stock options, as the exercise price of these options was greater than the average market value of
the Company's stock.
The diluted net earnings per share calculation for the fiscal years 2022 and 2021 included all shares
related to stock options, as the exercise price of these options was less than the average market
value of the Company's stock.
16. Common stock, stock option plans and stock compensation agreements
At December 31, 2023, the Company had onestock-based compensation plan. The shares outstanding are
for contracts under the Company's 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan and the 2022 Long-Term Incentive
Plan. The 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan expired on April 26, 2022. All awards (stock options,
restricted shares units and performance share units) granted subsequent to that date were under the
2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan. Under the 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan, the Company may issue up to
150million shares of common stock, of which up to 110million shares of common stock may be issued
subject to stock options or stock appreciation rights and up to 40million shares of common stock may
be issued subject to full value awards. Awards will generally be counted on a 1-for-1 basis against
the share reserve, provided that if more than 40million full value awards are granted, each full
value award in excess of 40million will be counted on a 5-for-1 basis against the share reserve.
Shares available for future grants under the 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan were 130million at the end
of fiscal year 2023.
The compensation cost that has been charged against income for these plans was $ 1,087million, $
1,028million and $ 1,038million for fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The total income
tax benefit recognized in the income statement for share-based compensation costs was $ 221million, $
177million and $ 199million for fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company also
recognized additional income tax benefits of $ 126million, $ 267million and $ 213million for fiscal
years 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, for which options were exercised or restricted shares were
vested. The total unrecognized compensation cost was $ 907million, $ 866million and $ 775million for
fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The weighted average period for this cost to be
recognized was 1.80years, 1.80years and 1.78years for fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021,
respectively. Share-based compensation costs capitalized as part of inventory were insignificant in
all periods.
The Company settles employee benefit equity issuances with treasury shares. Treasury shares are
replenished through market purchases throughout the year for the number of shares used to settle
employee benefit equity issuances.

Stock options
Stock options expire 10years from the date of grant and vest over service periods that range from
6months to 4years.
Options granted under the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan were granted at the average of the high and
low prices of the Company’s Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of grant. Options
granted under the 2022 Long-Term incentive Plan were granted at the closing price of the Company’s
Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of gran t.
The fair value of each option award was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option
valuation model that uses the assumptions noted in the following table. For 2023, 2022, and 2021
grants, expected volatility represents a blended rate of 10-year weekly historical overall volatility
rate, and a 5-week average implied volatility rate based on at-the-money traded Johnson & Johnson
options with a life of 2 years. For all grants, historical data is used to determine the expected
life of the option. The risk-free rate was based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the
time of grant.
The average fair value of options granted was $ 27.85, $ 23.23and $ 20.86, in fiscal years 2023, 2022
and 2021, respectively. The fair value was estimated based on the weighted average assumptions of:
 2023 2022 2021 
 Risk-free rate 3.74 % 1.98 % 0.83 % 
 Expected volatility 17.69 % 18.00 % 18.59 % 
 Expected life (in years) 7.0 7.0 7.0 
 Expected dividend yield 2.90 % 2.70 % 2.50 %

Restricted share units and performance share units
The Company grants restricted share units which vest over service periods that range from 6months to
3years. The Company also grants performance share units, which are paid in shares of Johnson &
Johnson Common Stock after the end of a three- yearperformance period. Performance shares were
granted with two equally-weighted goals that directly align with or help drive long-term total
shareholder return: adjusted operational earnings per share and relative total shareholder return.
The number of shares actually earned at the end of the three-yearperiod will vary, based only on
actual performance, from 0% to 200% of the target number of performance share units granted.
A summary of the restricted share units and performance share units activity under the Plans as of
December 31, 2023 is presented below:
 (Shares in Thousands) Outstanding Outstanding 
 Restricted Share Units Performance Share Units

*includes 1,421shares of restricted share units and 264shares of performance share units cancelled as
a result of the conversion of Johnson & Johnson restricted share units and performance share units
held by Kenvue employees into Kenvue restricted share units
The average fair value of the restricted share units granted was $ 152.63, $ 153.67and $ 152.62in
fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, using the fair market value at the date of grant. The
fair value of restricted share units was discounted for dividends, which are not paid on the
restricted share units during the vesting period. The fair value of restricted share units issued was
$ 605million, $ 591million and $ 611million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
The weighted average fair value of the performance share units granted was $ 145.17, $ 170.46and $
179.35in fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, calculated using the weighted average fair market value
for each of the component goals at the date of grant.
The fair values for the earnings per share goals of each performance share unit were estimated on the
date of grant using the fair market value of the shares at the time of the award discounted for
dividends, which are not paid on the performance share units during the vesting period. The fair
value for the relative total shareholder return goal of each performance share unit was estimated on
the date of grant using the Monte Carlo valuation model. The fair value of performance share units
issued was $ 140million, $ 94million and $ 83million in fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021,
respectively.

 18. Acquisitions and divestitures 
In the fiscal first quarter of 2024, the Company announced it has entered into a definitive agreement
to acquire Ambrx Biopharma, Inc., or Ambrx (Nasdaq: AMAM), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company
with a proprietary synthetic biology technology platform to design and develop next-generation
antibody drug conjugates (ADCs), in an all-cash merger transaction for a total equity value of
approximately $ 2.0billion, or $ 1.9billion net of estimated cash acquired. The Company will acquire
all of the outstanding shares of Ambrx’s common stock for $ 28.00per share through a merger of Ambrx
with a subsidiary of the Company. The closing of the transaction is expected to occur in the first
half of 2024, subject to receipt of Ambrx shareholder approval, as well as clearance under the Hart-
Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and other customary closing conditions. The Company expects
that the transaction will be accounted for as a business combination and the results of operations
will be included in the Innovative Medicine segment as of the acquisition date.
During the fiscal year 2023, the Company did not make any acquisitions that qualified as a business
combination.
During the fiscal year 2023, there were asset acquisitions of in-process research and development of
approximately $ 0.5billion in cash, primarily consisting of the acquisition of Laminar Inc. for $
0.4billion which was closed on November 30, 2023. Laminar Inc. is a privately-held medical device
company focused on eliminating the left atrial appendage (LAA) in patients with non-valvular atrial
fibrillation (AFib).
During the fiscal year 2022, certain businesses were acquired for $ 17.7billion in cash and $
1.1billion of liabilities assumed. These acquisitions were accounted for using the acquisition method
and, accordingly, results of operations have been included in the financial statements from their
respective dates of acquisition.
The excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible assets acquired amounted to $
17.3billion and has been assigned to identifiable intangible assets, with any residual recorded to
goodwill.
The fiscal year 2022 acquisitions primarily included Abiomed, Inc. (Abiomed). The remaining
acquisitions were not material.
On December 22, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of Abiomed, a leading, first-to-market
provider of cardiovascular medical technology with a first-in-kind portfolio for the treatment of
coronary artery disease and heart failure which also has an extensive innovation pipeline of life-
saving technologies. The transaction broadens the Company’s position as a growing cardiovascular
innovator, advancing the standard of care in heart failure and recovery, one of healthcare’s largest
areas of unmet need. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination and the results of
operations were included in the MedTech segment as of the date of the acquisition. The acquisition
was completed through a tender offer for all outstanding shares. The consideration paid in the
acquisition consisted of an upfront payment of $ 380.00per share in cash, amounting to $ 17.1billion,
net of cash acquired, as well as a non-tradeable contingent value right (“CVR”) entitling the holder
to receive up to $ 35.00per share in cash (which with respect to the CVRs total approximately $
1.6billion in the aggregate) if certain commercial and clinical milestones are achieved. The
corresponding enterprise value (without taking into account the CVRs) of approximately $ 16.5billion
includes cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities acquired.
The milestones of the CVR consist of:
a. $ 17.50per share, payable if net sales for Abiomed products exceeds $ 3.7billion during Johnson &
Johnson’s fiscal second quarter of 2027 through fiscal first quarter of 2028, or if this threshold is
not met during this period and is subsequently met during any rolling four quarter period up to the
end of Johnson & Johnson’s fiscal first quarter of 2029, $ 8.75per share;
b. $ 7.50per share payable upon FDA premarket application approval of the use of Impella® products in
ST-elevated myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients without cardiogenic shock by January 1, 2028; and
c. $ 10.00per share payable upon the first publication of a Class I recommendation for the use of
Impella® products in high risk PCI or STEMI with or without cardiogenic shock within four years from
their respective clinical endpoint publication dates, but in all cases no later than December 31,
2029.
During the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023, the Company finalized the purchase price allocation. In the
fiscal 2023, there were purchase price allocation adjustments netting to approximately $ 0.2billion
with an offsetting increase to goodwill. The fair value of the acquisition was allocated to assets
acquired of $ 20.1billion (net of $ 0.3billion cash acquired), primarily to goodwill for $
11.1billion, amortizable intangible assets for $ 6.6billion, IPR&D for $ 1.1billion, marketable
securities of $ 0.6billion and
 88 
liabilities assumed of $ 3.0billion, which includes the fair value of the contingent consideration
mentioned above for $ 0.7billion and deferred taxes of $ 2.0billion. The goodwill is primarily
attributable to the commercial acceleration and expansion of the portfolio and is not expected to be
deductible for tax purposes. The contingent consideration was recorded in Other Liabilities and
adjusted to fair value through the fiscal year end 2023 on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
The amortizable intangible assets were primarily comprised of already in-market products of the
Impella® platform with an average weighted life of 14years. The IPR&D assets were valued for
technology programs for unapproved products. The value of the IPR&D was calculated using probability-
adjusted cash flow projections discounted for the risk inherent in such projects. The probability of
success factor ranged from 52% to 70%. The discount rate applied was 9.5%.
In 2023, the Company recorded acquisition related costs before tax of approximately $ 0.2billion,
which was primarily recorded in Other (income)/expense. In 2022, the Company recorded acquisition
related costs before tax of approximately $ 0.3billion, which was recorded in Other (income)/expense.
During fiscal year 2021, the Company did not make any material acquisitions that qualified as a
business combination.
In accordance with U.S. GAAP standards related to business combinations, and goodwill and other
intangible assets, supplemental pro forma information for fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021 is not
provided, as the impact of the aforementioned acquisitions did not have a material effect on the
Company’s results of operations.
Divestitures
During the fiscal year 2023, the Company executed divestitures resulting in approximately $
0.2billion in proceeds resulting in gains or losses that were not material. At fiscal year end 2023,
the Company held assets, primarily intangibles, on its Consolidated Balance Sheet that it expects to
divest of approximately $ 0.3billion primarily related to Acclarent and Ponvory.
During fiscal year 2022, the Company did not make any material divestitures.
During fiscal year 2021, in separate transactions, the Company divested two brands outside the U.S.
within the Innovative Medicine segment. The Company recognized a pre-tax gain recorded in Other
(income) expense, net, of approximately $ 0.6billion.
 19. Legal proceedings 
Johnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims
regarding product liability; intellectual property; commercial; indemnification and other matters;
governmental investigations; and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary
course of their business.
The Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is
probable that a liability
will be incurred, and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of December 31, 2023,
the Company has determined that the liabilities associated with certain litigation matters are
probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue
to monitor each related legal issue and adjust accruals as might be warranted based on new
information and further developments in accordance with ASC 450-20-25, Contingencies. For these and
other litigation and regulatory matters discussed below for which a loss is probable or reasonably
possible, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts
accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments
about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing
of related payments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various
factors including, among other things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated
or indeterminate; scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings
are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute;
procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and unpredictability of the number of potential
claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party settlements; complexity of related cross-claims
and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. To the extent adverse awards,
judgments or verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an accrual
until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated.
In the Company’s opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and
discussions with counsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in
the Company’s balance sheet, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
financial position. However, the resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these
matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of
operations and cash flows for that period.
 2023 Annual Report89 
Matters concerning talc
A significant number of personal injury claims alleging that talc causes cancer have been asserted
against Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc., its successor LTL Management LLC (now known as LLT
Management LLC) and the Company arising out of the use of body powders containing talc, primarily
JOHNSON’S Baby Powder.
In talc cases that previously have gone to trial, the Company has obtained a number of defense
verdicts, but there also have been verdicts against the Company, many of which have been reversed on
appeal. In June 2020, the Missouri Court of Appeals reversed in part and affirmed in part a July 2018
verdict of $ 4.7billion in Ingham v. Johnson & Johnson, et al., No. ED 207476 (Mo. App.), reducing
the overall award to $ 2.1billion. An application for transfer of the case to the Missouri Supreme
Court was subsequently denied and in June 2021, a petition for certiorari, seeking a review of the
Ingham decision by the United States Supreme Court, was denied. In June 2021, the Company paid the
award, which, including interest, totaled approximately $ 2.5billion. The facts and circumstances,
including the terms of the award, were unique to the Ingham decision and not representative of other
claims brought against the Company. The Company continues to believe that it has strong legal grounds
to contest the other talc verdicts that it has appealed. Notwithstanding the Company’s confidence in
the safety of its talc products, in certain circumstances the Company has settled cases.
In October 2021, Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc. (Old JJCI) implemented a corporate restructuring
(the 2021 Corporate Restructuring). As a result of that restructuring, Old JJCI ceased to exist and
threenew entities were created: (a) LTL Management LLC, a North Carolina limited liability company
(LTL or Debtor); (b) Royalty A&M LLC, a North Carolina limited liability company and a direct
subsidiary of LTL (RAM); and (c) the Debtor’s direct parent, Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc., a New
Jersey company (New JJCI). The Debtor received certain of Old JJCI’s assets and became solely
responsible for the talc-related liabilities of Old JJCI, including all liabilities related in any
way to injury or damage, or alleged injury or damage, sustained or incurred in the purchase or use
of, or exposure to, talc, including talc contained in any product, or to the risk of, or
responsibility for, any such damage or injury, except for any liabilities for which the exclusive
remedy is provided under a workers’ compensation statute or act (the Talc-Related Liabilities).
In October 2021, notwithstanding the Company’s confidence in the safety of its talc products, the
Debtor filed a voluntary petition with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of
North Carolina, Charlotte Division, seeking relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (the LTL
Bankruptcy Case). All litigation against LTL, Old JJCI, New JJCI, the Company, other of their
corporate affiliates, identified retailers, insurance companies, and certain other parties (the
Protected Parties) was stayed, although LTL did agree to lift the stay on a small number of appeals
where appeal bonds had been filed. The LTL Bankruptcy Case was transferred to the United States
Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey. Claimants filed motions to dismiss the LTL
Bankruptcy Case and, following a multiple day hearing, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court denied those
motions in March 2022.
The claimants subsequently filed notices of appeal as to the denial of the motions to dismiss the LTL
Bankruptcy Case and the extension of the stay to the Protected Parties. On January 30, 2023, the
Third Circuit reversed the Bankruptcy Court’s ruling and remanded to the Bankruptcy Court to dismiss
the LTL bankruptcy.
LTL filed a petition for rehearing of the Third Circuit’s decision, which was denied in March 2023.
LTL subsequently filed a motion in the Third Circuit to stay the mandate directing the New Jersey
Bankruptcy Court to dismiss the LTL bankruptcy pending filing and disposition of a petition for writ
of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court. The Third Circuit denied the motion to stay the
mandate and issued the mandate.
In April 2023, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court dismissed the LTL Bankruptcy Case, effectively lifting
the stay as to all parties and returning the talc litigation to the tort system. LTL re-filed in the
United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey seeking relief under chapter 11 of the
Bankruptcy Code (the LTL 2 Bankruptcy Case). As a result of the new filing, all talc claims against
LTL were again automatically stayed pursuant to section 362 of the Bankruptcy Code. Additionally, the
New Jersey Bankruptcy Court issued a temporary restraining order staying all litigation as to LTL,
Old JJCI, New JJCI, the Company, identified retailers, and certain other parties (the New Protected
Parties).
Also in April 2023, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court issued a decision that granted limited injunctive
relief to the Company and the New Protected Parties (the LTL 2 Preliminary Injunction). The LTL 2
Preliminary Injunction remained in force until late August 2023, following the Bankruptcy Court’s
extension of the initial LTL 2 Preliminary Injunction in June 2023. Under the LTL 2 Preliminary
Injunction, except for in those cases filed in the federal court ovarian cancer multi-district
litigation, discovery in all personal injury and wrongful death matters was permitted to proceed.
Furthermore, in April 2023, the Talc Claimants' Committee filed a motion to dismiss the LTL 2
Bankruptcy followed by similar motions from other claimants. Hearings on the motions to dismiss
occurred in June 2023. On July 28, 2023, the court dismissed the LTL 2 Bankruptcy case and, the same
day, the Company stated its intent to appeal the decision and to continue its efforts to obtain a
resolution of the talc claims. In September 2023, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order granting LTL
leave to seek a direct appeal to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. In October 2023, the Third
Circuit granted LTL’s petition for a direct appeal. Briefing is ongoing.
 90 
Following the dismissal of LTL 2, new lawsuits were filed and cases across the country that had been
stayed were reactivated. The majority of the cases are pending in federal court, organized in a
multi-district litigation (MDL) in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey.
In the MDL, case-specific discovery is proceeding with an expectation that a trial will occur in
early 2025. Separately, discovery and pre-trial activity is underway in various individually filed
and set cases around the country, with most activity for such cases centralized in New Jersey and
California.
In the original bankruptcy case, the Company agreed to provide funding to LTL for the payment of
amounts the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court determines are owed by LTL and the establishment of a $
2billion trust in furtherance of this purpose. The Company established a reserve for approximately $
2billion in connection with the aforementioned trust. During the bankruptcy proceedings LTL had been
de-consolidated by the Company. In the LTL 2 Bankruptcy Case, the Company had agreed to contribute an
additional amount which, when added to the prior $ 2billion, would be a total reserve of
approximately $ 9billion payable over 25years (nominal value approximately $ 12billion discounted at
a rate of 4.41%), to resolve all the current and future talc claims. The approximate $ 9billion
reserve encompasses actual and contemplated settlements, of which approximately one-third is recorded
as a current liability. The recorded amount remains the Company’s best estimate of probable loss
after the dismissal.
The parties have not yet reached a resolution of all talc matters and the Company is unable to
estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amount accrued.
A class action advancing claims relating to industrial talc was filed against the Company and others
in New Jersey state court in May 2022 (the Edley Class Action). The Edley Class Action asserts, among
other things, that the Company fraudulently defended past asbestos personal injury lawsuits arising
from exposure to industrial talc mined, milled, and manufactured before January 6, 1989 by the
Company’s then wholly owned subsidiary, Windsor Minerals, Inc., which is currently a debtor in the
Imerys Bankruptcy described hereafter. The Company removed the Edley Class Action to federal court in
the District of New Jersey. In October 2022, the Company filed motions to dismiss and to deny
certification of a class to pursue the Edley Class Action in the New Jersey District Court. Argument
on the motions was heard in November 2023. Thereafter, the Company resolved this matter.
In February 2019, the Company’s talc supplier, Imerys Talc America, Inc. and two of its affiliates,
Imerys Talc Vermont, Inc. and Imerys Talc Canada, Inc. (collectively, Imerys) filed a voluntary
petition for relief under chapter 11 of the United States Code (the Bankruptcy Code) in the United
States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (Imerys Bankruptcy). The Imerys Bankruptcy
relates to Imerys’s potential liability for personal injury from exposure to talcum powder sold by
Imerys. In its bankruptcy, Imerys alleges it has claims against the Company for indemnification and
rights to joint insurance proceeds. In its bankruptcy, Imerys proposed a chapter 11 plan (the Imerys
Plan) that contemplated all talc-related claims against it being channeled to a trust along with its
alleged indemnification rights against the Company. Following confirmation and consummation of the
plan, the trust would pay talc claims pursuant to proposed trust distribution procedures (the TDP)
and then seek indemnification from the Company.
In February 2021, Cyprus Mines Corporation (Cyprus), which had owned certain Imerys talc mines, filed
a voluntary petition for relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code and filed its Disclosure
Statement and Plan (the Cyprus Plan). The Cyprus Plan contemplates a settlement with Imerys and talc
claimants where Cyprus would make a monetary contribution to a trust established under the Imerys
Plan in exchange for an injunction against talc claims asserted against it and certain affiliated
parties.
The Imerys Plan proceeded to solicitation in early 2021. However, the Imerys Plan did not receive the
requisite number of votes to be confirmed after the Bankruptcy Court ruled certain votes cast in
favor of the Imerys Plan should be disregarded. Imerys subsequently canceled its confirmation
hearing.
Imerys, the Imerys Tort Claimants’ Committee, and the Imerys Future Claimants’ Representative, along
with Cyprus, the Cyprus Tort Claimants’ Committee, and the Cyprus Future Claimants’ Representative
(collectively the Mediation Parties) have been engaged in mediation since shortly after the
confirmation hearing was canceled in October 2021. In September 2023, the Bankruptcy Court entered an
order extending the term of the mediation among the Mediation Parties through the end of December
2023. The Bankruptcy Court also authorized Imerys and Cyprus to proceed with mediation with certain
of their insurers through the end of December 2023.
In September 2023, Imerys and Cyprus filed amended plans of reorganization. The amended plans
contemplate a similar construct as the prior Imerys and Cyprus Plans, including all talc claims
against Imerys and Cyprus (and certain other protected parties) being channeled to a trust along with
Imerys’s and Cyprus’s alleged indemnification rights against the Company. In January 2024, Imerys and
Cyprus filed revised TDP. In February 2024, Imerys and Cyprus filed certain motions related to their
Disclosure Statement.
In February 2018, a securities class action lawsuit was filed against the Company and certain named
officers in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging that the
Company violated the federal securities laws by failing to disclose alleged asbestos contamination in
body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON’S Baby Powder, and that purchasers of the Company’s
shares suffered losses as a result. In April 2019, the Company moved to dismiss the complaint. In
 2023 Annual Report91 
December 2019, the Court denied, in part, the motion to dismiss. In April 2021, briefing on
Plaintiff’s motion for class certification was completed. The case was stayed in May 2022 pursuant to
the LTL Bankruptcy Case and was reopened in May 2023. In December 2023, the Court granted Plaintiff’s
motion for class certification. In January 2024, Defendants filed a petition with the Third Circuit
under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(f) for permission to appeal the Court’s order granting class
certification. Fact discovery is proceeding.
A lawsuit was brought against the Company in the Superior Court of California for the County of San
Diego alleging violations of California’s Consumer Legal Remedies Act (CLRA) relating to JOHNSON’S
Baby Powder. In that lawsuit, the plaintiffs allege that the Company violated the CLRA by failing to
provide required Proposition 65 warnings. In July 2019, the Company filed a notice of removal to the
United States District Court for the Southern District of California and plaintiffs filed a second
amended complaint shortly thereafter. In October 2019, the Company moved to dismiss the second
amended complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. In response to those
motions, plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint. In December 2019, the Company moved to dismiss
the third amended complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. In April
2020, the Court granted the motion to dismiss but granted leave to amend. In May 2020, plaintiffs
filed a Fourth Amended Complaint but indicated that they would be filing a motion for leave to file a
fifth amended complaint. Plaintiffs filed a Fifth Amended Complaint in August 2020. The Company moved
to dismiss the Fifth Amended Complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.
In January 2021, the Court issued an Order and opinion ruling in the Company’s favor and granting the
motion to dismiss with prejudice. In February 2021, Plaintiffs filed a Notice of Appeal with the
Ninth Circuit. Plaintiffs filed their opening brief in July 2021. The company filed its responsive
brief in October 2021. After the Notice of Suggestion of Bankruptcy was filed with the Ninth Circuit,
a stay was imposed, and the Court held the reply deadline in abeyance. In September 2023, the stay
lifted. With briefing complete, the Court is expected to either schedule oral argument or issue its
decision at any time.
In June 2014, the Mississippi Attorney General filed a complaint in Chancery Court of The First
Judicial District of Hinds County, Mississippi against the Company and Johnson & Johnson Consumer
Companies, Inc. (now known as Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc.) (collectively, JJCI). The complaint
alleges that JJCI violated the Mississippi Consumer Protection Act by failing to disclose alleged
health risks associated with female consumers’ use of talc contained in JOHNSON’S Baby Powder and
JOHNSON’S Shower to Shower (a product divested in 2012) and seeks injunctive and monetary relief. In
February 2022, the trial court set the case for trial to begin in February 2023. However, in October
2022, the LTL bankruptcy court issued an order staying the case. In March 2023, the Third Circuit
issued the mandate to dismiss the LTL Bankruptcy Case and in April 2023, the New Jersey Bankruptcy
Court dismissed the LTL Bankruptcy Case, effectively lifting the stay as to this matter. The State
requested a new trial setting. Later in April 2023, the trial court set a new trial date for April
2024. The Company filed summary judgment and Daubert motions. The State filed a limited Daubert
motion. The parties agreed to the Court's request for mediation. A pretrial conference is set for
February 2024 and trial is scheduled for April 2024. However, the Company is actively engaged in
resolution discussions concerning this matter.
In January 2020, the State of New Mexico filed a consumer protection case alleging that the Company
deceptively marketed and sold its talcum powder products by making misrepresentations about the
safety of the products and the presence of carcinogens, including asbestos. In March 2022, the New
Mexico court denied the Company’s motion to compel the State of New Mexico to engage in discovery of
state agencies and denied the Company’s request for interlocutory appeal of that decision. The
Company then filed a Petition for Writ of Superintending Control and a Request for a Stay to the New
Mexico Supreme Court on the issue of the State of New Mexico’s discovery obligations. In April 2022,
in view of the efforts to resolve talc-related claims in the LTL Bankruptcy Case, the Company and the
State agreed to a 60-day stay of all matters except for the pending writ before the New Mexico
Supreme Court, which expired in June 2022. Thereafter, the Company moved to enjoin prosecution of the
case in the LTL Bankruptcy Case. In October 2022, the bankruptcy court issued an order staying the
case. In December 2022, the State filed an appeal to the Third Circuit concerning the stay order.
Separately, in September 2022, the New Mexico Supreme Court granted the Company's request for a stay
pending further briefing on the scope of the State of New Mexico’s discovery obligations. In March
2023, the Third Circuit issued the mandate to dismiss the LTL Bankruptcy Case and in April 2023, the
New Jersey Bankruptcy Court dismissed the LTL Bankruptcy Case, effectively lifting the stay as to
this matter. While the State notified the New Mexico Supreme Court of the lifted stay of litigation
in April 2023, the Court has not taken any action since being notified of the lifting of the stay and
it remains in effect.
Forty-two states and the District of Columbia (including Mississippi and New Mexico) have commenced a
joint investigation into the Company’s marketing of its talcum powder products. At this time, the
multi-state group has not asserted any claims against the Company. Five states have issued Civil
Investigative Demands seeking documents and other information. The Company has produced documents to
Arizona, North Carolina, Texas, and Washington and entered into confidentiality agreements. The
Company has not received any follow up requests from those states. In March 2022, each of the forty-
two states agreed to mediation of their claims in the LTL Bankruptcy Case. In July 2022, New Mexico
and Mississippi indicated they would no longer voluntarily submit to further mediation in the LTL
Bankruptcy and would proceed with their respective cases in state court. In March 2023, the mediation
was terminated. In January 2024, the Company reached an agreement in principle with the multi-state
group of state Attorneys General, subject to ongoing negotiation of non-monetary terms. The unique
procedural history and status of the New Mexico and Mississippi matters specifically have been
discussed above.
 92 
In addition, the Company has received inquiries, subpoenas, and requests to produce documents
regarding talc matters and the LTL Bankruptcy Case from various governmental authorities. The Company
has produced documents and responded to inquiries, and will continue to cooperate with government
inquiries.
Matters concerning opioids
Beginning in 2014 and continuing to the present, the Company and Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI),
along with other pharmaceutical companies, have been named in close to 3,500lawsuits related to the
marketing of opioids, including DURAGESIC, NUCYNTA and NUCYNTA ER. The majority of the cases have
been filed by state and local governments. Similar lawsuits have also been filed by private
plaintiffs and organizations, including but not limited to the following: individual plaintiffs on
behalf of children born with Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS); hospitals; and health
insurers/payors.
To date, the Company and JPI have litigated two of the cases to judgment and have prevailed in both,
either at trial or on appeal.
In October 2019, the Company announced a proposed agreement in principle with a negotiating committee
of state Attorneys General to settle all remaining government opioid litigation claims nationwide.
Under the final national settlement agreement, which was announced in July 2021, the Company agreed
to pay up to $ 5.0billion to resolve all opioid lawsuits and future opioid claims by states, cities,
counties, local school districts and other special districts, and tribal governments, contingent on
sufficient participation by eligible government entities, and with credits back for entities that
declined or were ineligible to participate. In July 2021, the Company announced that the terms of the
agreement to settle the state and subdivision claims had been finalized and approximately 60% of the
all-in settlement was paid by the end of fiscal 2023. The expected payment schedule provides that
approximately $ 0.7billion of payments are to be paid by the end of fiscal 2024. The agreement is not
an admission of liability or wrongdoing, and it provides for the release of all opioid-related claims
against the Company, JPI, and their affiliates (including the Company’s former subsidiaries Tasmanian
Alkaloids Pty, Ltd. and Noramco, Inc.). As of January 2024, the Company and JPI have settled or
otherwise resolved the opioid claims advanced by all government entity claimants except the City of
Baltimore, a number of school districts and other claimants.
The Company and JPI continue to defend the cases brought by the remaining government entity litigants
as well as the cases brought by private litigants, including NAS claimants, hospitals, and health
insurers/payors. Counting the private litigant cases, there are approximately 35remaining opioid
cases against the Company and JPI in various state courts, 430remaining cases in the Ohio MDL, and
4additional cases in other federal courts. Some of these cases have been dismissed and are being
appealed by the plaintiffs and certain others are scheduled for trial in 2024 or 2025.
In addition, the Province of British Columbia filed suit against the Company and its Canadian
affiliate Janssen Inc., and many other industry members, in Canada, and is seeking to have that
action certified as an opt in class action on behalf of other provincial/territorial and the federal
governments in Canada. Additional proposed class actions have been filed in Canada against the
Company and Janssen Inc., and many other industry members, by and on behalf of people who used
opioids (for personal injuries), municipalities and First Nations bands. These actions allege a
variety of claims related to opioid marketing practices, including false advertising, unfair
competition, public nuisance, consumer fraud violations, deceptive acts and practices, false claims
and unjust enrichment. An adverse judgment in any of these lawsuits could result in the imposition of
large monetary penalties and significant damages including, punitive damages, cost of abatement,
substantial fines, equitable remedies and other sanctions.
From June 2017 through December 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors received a series of
shareholder demand letters alleging breaches of fiduciary duties related to the marketing of opioids.
The Board retained independent counsel to investigate the allegations in the demands, and in April
2020, independent counsel delivered a report to the Board recommending that the Company reject the
shareholder demands and take the steps that are necessary or appropriate to secure dismissal of
related derivative litigation. The Board unanimously adopted the recommendations of the independent
counsel’s report.
In November 2019, one of the shareholders who sent a demand filed a derivative complaint against the
Company as the nominal defendant and certain current and former directors and officers as defendants
in the Superior Court of New Jersey. The complaint alleges breaches of fiduciary duties related to
the marketing of opioids, and that the Company has suffered damages as a result of those alleged
breaches. A series of additional derivative complaints making similar allegations against the same
and similar defendants were filed in New Jersey state and federal courts in 2019 and 2020. By 2022,
all but two state court cases had been voluntarily dismissed. In February 2022, the state court
granted the Company’s motion to dismiss one of the two cases, and the shareholder that brought the
second case filed a notice of dismissal. The shareholder whose complaint was dismissed filed a motion
for reconsideration. In May 2022, the state court held oral argument on the motion for
reconsideration and subsequently denied the motion. The shareholder has appealed the state court’s
dismissal order.
 2023 Annual Report93 
Product liability
The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in numerous product liability claims and
lawsuits involving multiple products. Claimants in these cases seek substantial compensatory and,
where available, punitive damages. While the Company believes it has substantial defenses, it is not
feasible to predict the ultimate outcome of litigation. From time to time, even if it has substantial
defenses, the Company considers isolated settlements based on a variety of circumstances. The Company
has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal issue and adjust
accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance with
ASC 450-20-25, Contingencies. The Company accrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to
defend each matter when those costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. For certain of
these matters, the Company has accrued additional amounts such as estimated costs associated with
settlements, damages and other losses. Product liability accruals can represent projected product
liability for thousands of claims around the world, each in different litigation environments and
with different fact patterns. Changes to the accruals may be required in the future as additional
information becomes available.
The table below contains the most significant of these cases and provides the approximate number of
plaintiffs in the United States with direct claims in pending lawsuits regarding injuries allegedly
due to the relevant product or product category as of December 31, 2023:
 Product or product category Number of plaintiffs 
 Body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON’S 59,140 
 Baby Powder 
 DePuy ASR XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR Hip 160 
 Resurfacing System 
 PINNACLE Acetabular Cup System 920 
 Pelvic meshes 6,720 
 ETHICON PHYSIOMESH Flexible Composite Mesh 370 
 RISPERDAL 200 
 ELMIRON 2,150 
The number of pending lawsuits is expected to fluctuate as certain lawsuits are settled or dismissed
and additional lawsuits are filed. There may be additional claims that have not yet been filed.

DePuy ASR XL Acetabular System and ASR Hip Resurfacing System
In August 2010, DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. (DePuy) announced a worldwide voluntary recall of its ASR XL
Acetabular System and DePuy ASR Hip Resurfacing System (ASR Hip) used in hip replacement surgery.
Claims for personal injury have been made against DePuy and the Company. Cases filed in federal
courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States
District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. Litigation has also been filed in countries outside
of the United States, primarily in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Ireland, Germany, India and
Italy. In November 2013, DePuy reached an agreement with a Court-appointed committee of lawyers
representing ASR Hip plaintiffs to establish a program to settle claims with eligible ASR Hip
patients in the United States who had surgery to replace their ASR Hips, known as revision surgery,
as of August 2013. DePuy reached additional agreements in February 2015 and March 2017, which further
extended the settlement program to include ASR Hip patients who had revision surgeries after August
2013 and prior to February 15, 2017. This settlement program has resolved more than 10,000claims,
thereby bringing to resolution significant ASR Hip litigation activity in the United States. However,
lawsuits in the United States remain, and the settlement program does not address litigation outside
of the United States. In Australia, a class action settlement was reached that resolved the claims of
the majority of ASR Hip patients in that country. In Canada, the Company has reached agreements to
settle the class actions filed in that country. The Company continues to receive information with
respect to potential additional costs associated with this recall on a worldwide basis. The Company
has established accruals for the costs associated with the United States settlement program and ASR
Hip-related product liability litigation.
DePuy PINNACLE Acetabular Cup System
Claims for personal injury have also been made against DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. and the Company
(collectively, DePuy) relating to the PINNACLE Acetabular Cup System used in hip replacement surgery.
Product liability lawsuits continue to be filed, and the Company continues to receive information
with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. Most cases filed in federal
courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States
 94 
District Court for the Northern District of Texas (Texas MDL). Beginning on June 1, 2022, the
Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation ceased transfer of new cases into the Texas MDL, and there
are now cases pending in federal court outside the Texas MDL. Litigation also has been filed in state
courts and in countries outside of the United States. During the first quarter of 2019, DePuy
established a United States settlement program to resolve these cases. As part of the settlement
program, adverse verdicts have been settled. The Company has established an accrual for product
liability litigation associated with the PINNACLE Acetabular Cup System and the related settlement
program.
Ethicon Pelvic Mesh
Claims for personal injury have been made against Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon) and the Company arising out
of Ethicon’s pelvic mesh devices used to treat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse.
The Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and additional cases.
Cases filed in federal courts in the United States had been organized as a multi-district litigation
(MDL) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia. In March 2021,
the MDL Court entered an order closing the MDL. The MDL Court has remanded cases for trial to the
jurisdictions where the case was originally filed and additional pelvic mesh lawsuits have been
filed, and remain, outside of the MDL. The Company has settled or otherwise resolved the majority of
the United States cases and the estimated costs associated with these settlements and the remaining
cases are reflected in the Company’s accruals. In addition, class actions and individual personal
injury cases or claims seeking damages for alleged injury resulting from Ethicon’s pelvic mesh
devices have been commenced in various countries outside of the United States, including claims and
cases in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Ireland, Italy, Spain and Slovenia and
class actions in Israel, Australia, Canada and South Africa. In November 2019, the Federal Court of
Australia issued a judgment regarding its findings with respect to liability in relation to the three
Lead Applicants and generally in relation to the design, manufacture, pre and post-market assessments
and testing, and supply and promotion of the devices in Australia used to treat stress urinary
incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. In September 2022, after exhausting its appeals, the Company
reached an in-principle agreement to resolve the two pelvic mesh class actions in Australia and in
March 2023 the Federal Court approved the settlement. The class actions in Canada were discontinued
in 2020 as a result of a settlement of a group of cases and an agreement to resolve the Israeli class
action was reached in May 2021. The parties in the Israeli class action are currently finalizing the
terms of the settlement. A motion to approve the settlement was filed with the Court. The Company has
established accruals with respect to product liability litigation associated with Ethicon’s pelvic
mesh products.
Ethicon Physiomesh
Following a June 2016 worldwide market withdrawal of Ethicon Physiomesh Flexible Composite Mesh
(Physiomesh), claims for personal injury have been made against Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon) and the
Company alleging personal injury arising out of the use of this hernia mesh device. Cases filed in
federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation (MDL) in the
United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. A multi-county litigation (MCL)
also has been formed in New Jersey state court and assigned to Atlantic County for cases pending in
New Jersey. In addition to the matters in the MDL and MCL, there are additional lawsuits pending in
the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, which are part of the MDL for
polypropylene mesh devices manufactured by C.R. Bard, Inc., and lawsuits pending in two New Jersey
MCLs formed for Proceed/Proceed Ventral Patch and Prolene Hernia systems, and lawsuits pending
outside the United States. In May 2021, Ethicon and lead counsel for the plaintiffs entered into a
term sheet to resolve approximately 3,600Physiomesh cases (covering approximately 4,300plaintiffs)
pending in the MDL and MCL at that time. A master settlement agreement (MSA) was entered into in
September 2021 and includes 3,729cases in the MDL and MCL. All deadlines and trial settings in those
proceedings are currently stayed pending the completion of the settlement agreement. Of the cases
subject to the MSA, 3,390have been dismissed with prejudice. Ethicon has received releases from
3,584plaintiffs, and releases continue to be submitted as part of the settlement process. Post-
settlement cases in the Physiomesh MDL and MCL are subject to docket control orders requiring early
expert reports and discovery requirements. In May 2023, Ethicon entered an additional settlement to
resolve the claims of 292Physiomesh claimants. That settlement is proceeding, and releases are being
returned. As of December 31, 2023, there were 5Physiomesh cases in the MDL and 3in the New Jersey MCL
which are not included in either settlement and which remain subject to the docket control orders.
Claims have also been filed against Ethicon and the Company alleging personal injuries arising from
the PROCEED Mesh and PROCEED Ventral Patch hernia mesh products. In March 2019, the New Jersey
Supreme Court entered an order consolidating these cases pending in New Jersey as an MCL in Atlantic
County Superior Court. Additional cases have been filed in various federal and state courts in the
United States, and in jurisdictions outside the United States.
Ethicon and the Company also have been subject to claims for personal injuries arising from the
PROLENE Polypropylene Hernia System. In January 2020, the New Jersey Supreme Court created an MCL in
Atlantic County Superior Court to handle such cases. Cases involving this product have also been
filed in other federal and state courts in the United States.
In October 2022, an agreement in principle, subject to various conditions, was reached to settle the
majority of the pending cases involving Proceed, Proceed Ventral Patch, Prolene Hernia System and
related multi-layered mesh products, as well as a number of unfiled claims. All litigation activities
in the two New Jersey MCLs are stayed pending effectuation of the proposed settlement. Future cases
that are filed in the New Jersey MCLs will be subject to docket control orders requiring early expert
reports and discovery requirements.
 2023 Annual Report95 
The Company has established accruals with respect to product liability litigation associated with
Ethicon Physiomesh Flexible Composite Mesh, PROCEED Mesh and PROCEED Ventral Patch, and PROLENE
Polypropylene Hernia System products.
Innovative Medicine
RISPERDAL
Claims for personal injury have been made against Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and the Company
arising out of the use of RISPERDAL, and related compounds, indicated for the treatment of
schizophrenia, acute manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder and irritability
associated with autism. Lawsuits primarily have been filed in state courts in Pennsylvania,
California, and Missouri. Other actions are pending in various courts in the United States and
Canada. Product liability lawsuits continue to be filed, and the Company continues to receive
information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. The Company has
successfully defended a number of these cases but there have been verdicts against the Company,
including a verdict in October 2019 of $ 8.0billion of punitive damages related to one plaintiff,
which the trial judge reduced to $ 6.8million in January 2020. In September 2021, the Company entered
into a settlement in principle with the counsel representing plaintiffs in this matter and in
substantially all of the outstanding cases in the United States. The costs associated with this and
other settlements are reflected in the Company’s accruals.
ELMIRON
Claims for personal injury have been made against a number of Johnson & Johnson companies, including
Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and the Company, arising out of the use of ELMIRON, a prescription
medication indicated for the relief of bladder pain or discomfort associated with interstitial
cystitis. These lawsuits, which allege that ELMIRON contributes to the development of permanent
retinal injury and vision loss, have been filed in both state and federal courts across the United
States. In December 2020, lawsuits filed in federal courts in the United States, including putative
class action cases seeking medical monitoring, were organized as a multi-district litigation in the
United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. All cases in the multi-district
litigation are in active discussions regarding resolution, and as a result, all activity is stayed.
In addition, cases have been filed in various state courts of New Jersey, which have been coordinated
in a multi-county litigation in Bergen County, as well as the Court of Common Pleas in Philadelphia,
which have been coordinated and granted mass tort designation. No activity has taken place in the New
Jersey state court litigation; however, three bellwether trials have been set in Philadelphia for
March, April and May 2024. In addition, three class action lawsuits have been filed in Canada.
Product liability lawsuits continue to be filed, and the Company continues to receive information
with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. The Company has established
accruals for defense and indemnity costs associated with ELMIRON related product liability
litigation.
Intellectual property
Certain subsidiaries of the Company are subject, from time to time, to legal proceedings and claims
related to patent, trademark and other intellectual property matters arising out of their businesses.
Many of these matters involve challenges to the coverage and/or validity of the patents on various
products and allegations that certain of the Company’s products infringe the patents of third
parties. Although these subsidiaries believe that they have substantial defenses to these challenges
and allegations with respect to all significant patents, there can be no assurance as to the outcome
of these matters. A loss in any of these cases could adversely affect the ability of these
subsidiaries to sell their products, result in loss of sales due to loss of market exclusivity,
require the payment of past damages and future royalties, and may result in a non- cash impairment
charge for any associated intangible asset.
Innovative Medicine - litigation against filers of abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs)
The Company’s subsidiaries have brought lawsuits against generic companies that have filed ANDAs with
the U.S. FDA (or similar lawsuits outside of the United States) seeking to market generic versions of
products sold by various subsidiaries of the Company prior to expiration of the applicable patents
covering those products. These lawsuits typically include allegations of non-infringement and/or
invalidity of patents listed in FDA’s publication “Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic
Equivalence Evaluations” (commonly known as the Orange Book). In each of these lawsuits, the
Company’s subsidiaries are seeking an order enjoining the defendant from marketing a generic version
of a product before the expiration of the relevant patents (Orange Book Listed Patents). In the event
the Company’s subsidiaries are not successful in an action, or any automatic statutory stay expires
before the court rulings are obtained, the generic companies involved would have the ability, upon
regulatory approval, to introduce generic versions of their products to the market, resulting in the
potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for the applicable products, and which may
result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. In addition, from time to
time, the Company’s subsidiaries may settle these types of actions
 96 
and such settlements can involve the introduction of generic versions of the products at issue to the
market prior to the expiration of the relevant patents.
The Inter Partes Review (IPR) process with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO),
created under the 2011 America Invents Act, is also being used at times by generic companies in
conjunction with ANDAs and lawsuits to challenge the applicable patents.

MedTech
In March 2016, Abiomed, Inc. (Abiomed) filed a declaratory judgment action against Maquet
Cardiovascular LLC (Maquet) in U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts seeking a
declaration that the Impella does not infringe certain Maquet patents, currently U.S. Patent Nos.

non-infringement of the ’100 patent, and in September 2023, the district court entered final judgment
in favor of Abiomed on all patents-in-suit. Maquet appealed.
Government proceedings
Like other companies in the pharmaceutical and medical technologies industries, the Company and
certain of its subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation by national, state and local
government agencies in the United States and other countries in which they operate. Such regulation
has been the basis of government investigations and litigations. The most significant litigation
brought by, and investigations conducted by, government agencies are listed below. It is possible
that criminal charges and substantial fines and/or civil penalties or damages could result from
government investigations or litigation.
MedTech
In July 2018, the Public Prosecution Service in Rio de Janeiro and representatives from the Brazilian
antitrust authority CADE inspected the offices of more than 30 companies including Johnson & Johnson
do Brasil Indústria e Comércio de Produtos para Saúde Ltda. The authorities appear to be
investigating allegations of possible anti-competitive behavior and possible improper payments in the
medical device industry. The Company continues to respond to inquiries regarding the Foreign
 98 
Corrupt Practices Act from the United States Department of Justice and the United States Securities
and Exchange Commission.
In July 2023, the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) issued Civil Investigative Demands to the
Company, Johnson & Johnson Surgical Vision, Inc., and Johnson & Johnson Vision Care, Inc.
(collectively, “J&J Vision”) in connection with a civil investigation under the False Claims Act
relating to free or discounted intraocular lenses and equipment used in eye surgery, such as
phacoemulsification and laser systems. J&J Vision has begun producing documents and information
responsive to the Civil Investigative Demands. J&J Vision is in ongoing discussions with the DOJ
regarding its inquiry.
Innovative Medicine
In July 2016, the Company and Janssen Products, LP were served with a qui tam complaint pursuant to
the False Claims Act filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey
alleging the off-label promotion of two HIV products, PREZISTA and INTELENCE, and anti-kickback
violations in connection with the promotion of these products. The complaint was filed under seal in
December 2012. The federal and state governments have declined to intervene, and the lawsuit is being
prosecuted by the relators. The Court denied summary judgment on all claims in December 2021. Daubert
motions were granted in part and denied in part in January 2022, and the case is proceeding to trial.
Trial is scheduled for May 2024.
In March 2017, Janssen Biotech, Inc. (JBI) received a Civil Investigative Demand from the United
States Department of Justice regarding a False Claims Act investigation concerning management and
advisory services provided to rheumatology and gastroenterology practices that purchased REMICADE or
SIMPONI ARIA. In August 2019, the United States Department of Justice notified JBI that it was
closing the investigation. Subsequently, the United States District Court for the District of
Massachusetts unsealed a qui tam False Claims Act complaint, which was served on the Company. The
Department of Justice had declined to intervene in the qui tam lawsuit in August 2019. The Company
filed a motion to dismiss, which was granted in part and denied in part. Discovery is underway.
From time to time, the Company has received requests from a variety of United States Congressional
Committees to produce information relevant to ongoing congressional inquiries. It is the policy of
Johnson & Johnson to cooperate with these inquiries by producing the requested information.
General litigation
The Company or its subsidiaries are also parties to various proceedings brought under the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund,
and comparable state, local or foreign laws in which the primary relief sought is the Company’s
agreement to implement remediation activities at designated hazardous waste sites or to reimburse the
government or third parties for the costs they have incurred in performing remediation as such sites.
In October 2017, certain United States service members and their families brought a complaint against
a number of pharmaceutical and medical devices companies, including Johnson & Johnson and certain of
its subsidiaries in United States District Court for the District of Columbia, alleging that the
defendants violated the United States Anti-Terrorism Act. The complaint alleges that the defendants
provided funding for terrorist organizations through their sales practices pursuant to pharmaceutical
and medical device contracts with the Iraqi Ministry of Health. In July 2020, the District Court
dismissed the complaint. In January 2022, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia Circuit reversed the District Court’s decision. In June 2023, defendants filed a petition
for a writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court.
In February 2024, a putative class action was filed against the Company, the Pension & Benefits
Committee of Johnson & Johnson, and certain named officers and employees, in United States District
Court for the District of New Jersey. The complaint alleges that defendants breached fiduciary duties

 20. Restructuring 
In fiscal 2023, the Company commenced restructuring actions within its Innovative Medicine and
MedTech segments. The amounts and details of the current year programs are included below.
In fiscal 2023, the Company completed a prioritization of its research and development (R&D)
investment within its Innovative Medicine segment to focus on the most promising medicines with the
greatest benefit to patients. This resulted in the exit of certain programs within certain
therapeutic areas. The R&D program exits are primarily in infectious diseases and vaccines including
the discontinuation of its respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) adult vaccine program, hepatitis and HIV
development. Pre- tax Restructuring expenses of $ 479million in the fiscal year 2023, included the
termination of partnered and non-partnered development program costs and asset impairments. The
estimated costs of these total activities is between $ 500million - $ 600million and is expected to
be completed by the end of fiscal year 2024.
In fiscal 2023, the Company initiated a restructuring program of its Orthopaedics franchise within
the MedTech segment to streamline operations by exiting certain markets, product lines and
distribution network arrangements. The pre-tax restructuring expense of $ 319million in the fiscal
year 2023 primarily included inventory and instrument charges related to market and product exits.
The estimated costs of the total program are between $ 700million - $ 800million and is expected to
be completed by the end of fiscal year 2025.
The following table summarizes the restructuring expenses for the fiscal year 2023:
 (Pre-tax Dollars in Millions) 2023 
 Innovative Medicine Segment(1) $479 
 MedTech Segment(2) 319 
 Total Programs $798 
(1) Included $ 449million in Restructuring and $ 30million in Cost of products sold on the
Consolidated Statement of Earnings
(2) Included $ 40million in Restructuring and $ 279million in Cost of products sold on the
Consolidated Statement of Earnings
Restructuring reserves as of December 31, 2023 and January 1, 2023 were insignificant.
 2023 Annual Report101 
 21. Kenvue separation and discontinued operations 
On May 8, 2023, Kenvue, completed an initial public offering (the IPO) resulting in the issuance of
198,734,444shares of its common stock, par value $ 0.01per share (the “Kenvue Common Stock”), at an
initial public offering of $ 22.00per share for net proceeds of $ 4.2billion. The excess of the net
proceeds from the IPO over the net book value of the Johnson & Johnson divested interest was $
2.5billion and was recorded to additional paid-in capital. As of the closing of the IPO, Johnson &
Johnson owned approximately 89.6% of the total outstanding shares of Kenvue Common Stock and at July
2, 2023, the non-controlling interest of $ 1.3billion associated with Kenvue was reflected in equity
attributable to non-controlling interests in the consolidated balance sheet in the fiscal second
quarter of 2023.
On August 23, 2023, Johnson & Johnson completed the disposition of an additional 80.1% ownership of
Kenvue Common Stock through an exchange offer, which resulted in Johnson & Johnson acquiring
190,955,436shares of the Company’s common stock in exchange for 1,533,830,450shares of Kenvue Common
Stock. The $ 31.4billion of Johnson & Johnson common stock received in the exchange offer is recorded
in Treasury stock. Following the exchange offer, the Company owns 9.5% of the total outstanding
shares of Kenvue Common Stock that was recorded in other assets within continuing operations at the
fair market value of $ 4.3billion as of August 23, 2023. Subsequent changes are reflected in other
income/expense and amounted to $ 0.4billion expense through December 31, 2023.
Johnson & Johnson divested net assets of $ 11.6billion as of August 23, 2023, and the accumulated
other comprehensive loss attributable to the Consumer Health business at that date was $ 4.3billion.
Additionally, at the date of the exchange offer, Johnson & Johnson decreased the non-controlling
interest by $ 1.2billion to record the deconsolidation of Kenvue. This resulted in a non-cash gain on
the exchange offer of $ 21.0billion that was recorded in Net earnings from discontinued operations,
net of taxes in the consolidated statements of earnings for the fiscal third quarter of 2023. This
one-time gain includes a gain of $ 2.8billion on the Kenvue Common Stock retained by Johnson &
Johnson. The gain on the exchange offer qualifies as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income
tax purposes.
Also in connection with the separation, Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue entered into a separation
agreement and also entered into various other agreements that provide for certain transactions to
effect the transfer of the assets and liabilities of the Consumer Health business to Kenvue and to
govern various interim and ongoing relationships between Kenvue and Johnson & Johnson following the
completion of the Kenvue IPO, including transition services agreements (TSAs), transition
manufacturing agreements (TMAs), trademark agreements, intellectual property agreements, an employee
matters agreement, and a tax matters agreement. Under the TSAs, Johnson & Johnson will provide Kenvue
various services and, similarly, Kenvue will provide Johnson & Johnson various services. The
provision of services under the TSAs generally will terminate within 24months following the Kenvue
IPO. Additionally, Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue entered into TMAs pursuant to which Johnson & Johnson
will manufacture and supply to Kenvue certain products and, similarly, Kenvue will manufacture and
supply to Johnson & Johnson certain products. The terms of the TMAs range in initial duration from
3months to 5years.
Amounts related to the TSAs and TMAs included in the consolidated statements of earnings were
immaterial for the fiscal year 2023. Additionally, the amounts due to and from Kenvue for the above
agreements was not material as of December 31, 2023.
The results of the Consumer Health business (previously reported as a separate business segment), as
well as the associated gain, have been reflected as discontinued operations in the Company’s
consolidated statements of earnings as Net earnings from discontinued operations, net of taxes. Prior
periods have been recast to reflect this presentation. As a result of the separation of Kenvue,
Johnson & Johnson incurred separation costs of $ 986million, $ 1,089million and $ 67million in the
fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which are also included in Net earnings from
discontinued operations, net of taxes. These costs were primarily related to external advisory,
legal, accounting, contractor and other incremental costs directly related to separation activities.
In the fiscal 2022, as part of the planned separation of the Company’s Consumer Health business, the
Company recognized approximately $ 0.5billion in net incremental tax costs. As of January 1, 2023,
the assets and liabilities associated with the Consumer Health business were classified as assets and
liabilities of discontinued operations in the consolidated balance sheets.

 2023 Annual Report105 
Report of independent registered public accounting firm
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Johnson & Johnson
Opinions on the financial statements and internal control over financial reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Johnson & Johnson and its
subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2023 and January 1, 2023, and the related
consolidated statements of earnings, of comprehensive income, of equity and of cash flows for each of
the three fiscal years in the period ended December 31, 2023, including the related notes
(collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the
Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria
established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and January 1, 2023,
and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period
ended December 31, 2023 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in
Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.
 Basis for opinions 
The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s
consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting
based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the
Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations
of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated
financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the
risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or
fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on
a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial
statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated
financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for
our opinions.
Definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and
(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
 106 
 Critical audit matters 
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of
the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the
audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated
financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.
The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated
financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters
below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to
which they relate.
U.S. pharmaceutical rebate reserves – managed care, medicare and medicaid
As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes revenue from
product sales when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied. Rebates
and discounts provided to customers are accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as a
reduction in sales. The liability for such rebates and discounts is recognized within Accrued
Rebates, Returns, and Promotions on the consolidated balance sheet. A significant portion of the
liability related to rebates is from the sale of pharmaceutical goods within the U.S., primarily the
Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid programs, which amounted to $11.5 billion as of December 31,
2023. For significant rebate programs, which include the U.S. Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid
rebate programs, rebates and discounts estimated by management are based on contractual terms,
historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis, and projected market conditions in the U.S.
pharmaceutical market.
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to U.S.
pharmaceutical rebate reserves - Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid is a critical audit matter are
the significant judgment by management due to the significant measurement uncertainty involved in
developing these reserves and the high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and audit effort in
performing procedures and evaluating the assumptions related to contractual terms, historical
experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis, and projected market conditions in the U.S.
pharmaceutical market.
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with
forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included
testing the effectiveness of controls relating to U.S. pharmaceutical rebate reserves - Managed Care,
Medicare and Medicaid, including controls over the assumptions used to estimate these rebates. These
procedures also included, among others, (i) developing an independent estimate of the rebates by
utilizing third party information on price and market conditions in the U.S. pharmaceutical market,
the terms of the specific rebate programs, and the historical experience and trend analysis of actual
rebate claims paid; (ii) testing rebate claims processed by the Company, including evaluating those
claims for consistency with the contractual and mandated terms of the Company’s rebate arrangements;
and (iii) comparing the independent estimates to management’s estimates.
 Litigation contingencies – talc 
As described in Notes 1 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company records accruals
for loss contingencies associated with legal matters, including talc, when it is probable that a
liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. To the extent
adverse awards, judgments, or verdicts have been rendered against the Company, management does not
record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated. For
these matters, management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts
accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments
about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing
of related payments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various
factors, including, among other things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated
or indeterminate; scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings
are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute;
procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and unpredictability of the number of potential
claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party settlements; complexity of related cross-claims
and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. Management continues to believe that
the Company has strong legal grounds to contest the talc verdicts it has appealed. Notwithstanding
management’s confidence in the safety of the Company’s talc products, in certain circumstances the
Company has settled cases. The Company has recognized a total provision of approximately $9 billion,
of which approximately one-third is recorded as a current liability and which encompasses actual and
contemplated settlements. The recorded amount remains the Company's best estimate of probable loss
after the dismissal. The parties have not yet reached a full resolution of all talc matters and the
Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the remaining amount accrued.
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the talc
litigation is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when assessing the
likelihood of a loss being incurred, when determining whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or
range of loss for the future and existing talc claims can be made, and when determining the timing of
any settlement payments, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and
effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s assessment of the loss contingencies
associated with this litigation.
 2023 Annual Report107 
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with
forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included
testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s evaluation of the talc litigation,
including controls over determining whether a loss is probable and whether the amount of loss can be
reasonably estimated, as well as financial statement disclosures. These procedures also included,
among others, (i) gaining an understanding of the Company’s process around the accounting and
reporting for the talc litigation; (ii) obtaining and evaluating certain executed settlement
agreements related to the talc litigation (iii) discussing the status of significant known actual and
potential litigation and settlements activity with the Company’s in-house legal counsel, as well as
external counsel when deemed necessary; (iv) obtaining and evaluating the letters of audit inquiry
with internal and external legal counsel for significant litigation; (v) evaluating the
reasonableness of management’s assessment regarding whether an unfavorable outcome is reasonably
possible or probable and reasonably estimable; and (vi) evaluating the sufficiency of the Company’s
litigation contingencies disclosures.

Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting
Under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, management is required to assess the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal
year and report, based on that assessment, whether the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting is effective.
Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control
over financial reporting. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to
provide reasonable assurance as to the reliability of the Company’s financial reporting and the
preparation of external financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles.
Internal controls over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations.
Therefore, internal control over financial reporting determined to be effective can provide only
reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and may not prevent or detect
all misstatements. Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
The Company’s management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. In making this assessment, the Company used the criteria
established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in
“Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013).” These criteria are in the areas of control
environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and communication, and monitoring. The
Company’s assessment included extensive documenting, evaluating and testing the design and operating
effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting.
Based on the Company’s processes and assessment, as described above, management has concluded that,
as of December 31, 2023, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective.
The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023
has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as
stated in their report, which appears herein.

Disclosure controls and procedures. At the end of the period covered by this Report, the Company
evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures.
The Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to

recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and
forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it
files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management,
including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar
functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Joaquin Duato,
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Joseph J. Wolk, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial
Officer, reviewed and participated in this evaluation. Based on this evaluation, Messrs. Duato and
Wolk concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Report, the Company’s disclosure
controls and procedures were effective.

control over financial reporting. The Company continues to monitor and assess the effectiveness of
the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures.
The Company is implementing a multi-year, enterprise-wide initiative to integrate, simplify and
standardize processes and systems for the human resources, information technology, procurement,
