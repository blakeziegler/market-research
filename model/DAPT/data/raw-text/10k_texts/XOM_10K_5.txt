│ BUSINESS │
Exxon Mobil Corporation was incorporated in the State of New Jersey in 1882. Divisions and affiliated
companies of ExxonMobil operate or market products in the United States and most other countries of
the world. Their principal business involves exploration for, and production of, crude oil and
natural gas and manufacture, trade, transport and sale of crude oil, natural gas, petroleum products,
petrochemicals and a wide variety of specialty products. Affiliates of ExxonMobil conduct extensive
research programs in support of these businesses.
Exxon Mobil Corporation has several divisions and hundreds of affiliates, many with names that
include ExxonMobil , Exxon , Esso, Mobil or XTO . For convenience and simplicity, in this report the
terms ExxonMobil, Exxon, Esso, Mobil and XTO , as well as terms like Corporation , Company , our , we
and its , are sometimes used as abbreviated references to specific affiliates or groups of
affiliates. The precise meaning depends on the context in question.
The energy and petrochemical industries are highly competitive, both within the industries and also
with other industries in supplying the energy, fuel and chemical needs of industrial and individual
consumers. The Corporation competes with other firms in the sale or purchase of needed goods and
services in many national and international markets and employs all methods of competition which are
lawful and appropriate for such purposes.
Operating data and industry segment information for the Corporation are contained in the Financial
Section of this report under the following: “Note 18: Disclosures about Segments and Related
Information” and “Operating Information”. Information on oil and gas reserves is contained in the
“Oil and Gas Reserves” part of the “Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Exploration and
Production Activities” portion of the Financial Section of this report.
ExxonMobil has a long-standing commitment to the development of proprietary technology. We have a
wide array of research programs designed to meet the needs identified in each of our business
segments. ExxonMobil held nearly 9 thousand active patents worldwide at the end of 2020. For
technology licensed to third parties, revenues totaled approximately $130 million in 2020. Although
technology is an important contributor to the overall operations and results of our Company, the
profitability of each business segment is not dependent on any individual patent, trade secret,
trademark, license, franchise or concession.
ExxonMobil operates in a highly complex, competitive and changing global energy business environment
where decisions and risks play out over time horizons that are often decades in length. This long-
term orientation underpins the Corporation's philosophy on talent development.
Talent development begins with recruiting exceptional candidates and continues with individually
planned experiences and training designed to facilitate broad development and a deep understanding of
our business across the business cycle. Our career-oriented approach to talent development results in
strong retention and an average length of service of 30 years for our career employees. Compensation,
benefits and workplace programs support the Corporation's talent management approach, and are
designed to attract and retain employees for a career through compensation that is market
competitive, long-term oriented, and highly differentiated by individual performance.
Sixty percent of our global employee workforce is from outside the U.S., and over the past decade 39
percent of our global hires for management, professional and technical positions were female and 31
percent of our U.S. hires for management, professional and technical positions were minorities. With
over 160 nationalities represented in the Company, we encourage and respect diversity of thought,
ideas and perspective from our workforce. We consider and monitor diversity through all stages of
employment, including recruitment, training and development of our employees. We also work closely
with the communities where we operate to identify and invest in initiatives that help support local
needs, including local talent and skill development.
The number of regular employees was 72 thousand, 75 thousand, and 71 thousand at years ended 2020,
2019, and 2018, respectively. Regular employees are defined as active executive, management,
professional, technical and wage employees who work full time or part time for the Corporation and
are covered by the Corporation’s benefit plans and programs.
As discussed in item 1A. Risk Factors in this report, compliance with existing and potential future
government regulations, including taxes, environmental regulations, and other government regulations
and policies that directly or indirectly affect the production and sale of our products, may have
material effects on the capital expenditures, earnings, and competitive position of ExxonMobil. With
respect to the environment, throughout ExxonMobil’s businesses, new and ongoing measures are taken to
prevent and minimize the impact of our operations on air, water and ground, including, but not
limited to, compliance with environmental regulations. These include a significant investment in
refining infrastructure and technology to manufacture clean fuels, as well as projects to monitor and
reduce nitrogen oxide, sulfur oxide and greenhouse gas emissions, and expenditures for asset
retirement obligations. Using definitions and guidelines established by the American Petroleum
Institute, ExxonMobil’s 2020 worldwide environmental expenditures for all such preventative and
remediation steps, including ExxonMobil’s share of equity company expenditures, were $4.5 billion, of
which $3.4 billion were included in expenses with the remainder in capital expenditures. The total
cost for such activities is expected to increase to approximately $4.9 billion in 2021 and 2022.
Capital expenditures are expected to account for approximately 25 percent of the total.

│ ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS │
ExxonMobil’s financial and operating results are subject to a variety of risks inherent in the global
oil, gas, and petrochemical businesses. Many of these risk factors are not within the Company’s
control and could adversely affect our business, our financial and operating results, or our
financial condition. These risk factors include:
 Supply and Demand 
The oil, gas, and petrochemical businesses are fundamentally commodity businesses. This means
ExxonMobil’s operations and earnings may be significantly affected by changes in oil, gas, and
petrochemical prices and by changes in margins on refined products. Oil, gas, petrochemical, and
product prices and margins in turn depend on local, regional, and global events or conditions that
affect supply and demand for the relevant commodity. Any material decline in oil or natural gas
prices could have a material adverse effect on certain of the Company’s operations, especially in the
Upstream segment, financial condition, and proved reserves. On the other hand, a material increase in
oil or natural gas prices could have a material adverse effect on certain of the Company’s
operations, especially in the Downstream and Chemical segments.
Economic conditions. The demand for energy and petrochemicals is generally linked closely with broad-
based economic activities and levels of prosperity. The occurrence of recessions or other periods of
low or negative economic growth will typically have a direct adverse impact on our results. Other
factors that affect general economic conditions in the world or in a major region, such as changes in
population growth rates, periods of civil unrest, government austerity programs, trade tariffs,
security or public health issues and responses, or currency exchange rate fluctuations, can also
impact the demand for energy and petrochemicals. Sovereign debt downgrades, defaults, inability to
access debt markets due to credit or legal constraints, liquidity crises, the breakup or
restructuring of fiscal, monetary, or political systems such as the European Union, and other events
or conditions that impair the functioning of financial markets and institutions also pose risks to
ExxonMobil, including risks to the safety of our financial assets and to the ability of our partners
and customers to fulfill their commitments to ExxonMobil. Demand reduction due to the COVID-19
pandemic as well as accompanying conditions of oversupply have led to a significant decrease in
commodity prices and margins. Future business results, including cash flows and financing needs, will
be affected by the extent and duration of these conditions and the effectiveness of responsive
actions that the Corporation and others take, including actions to reduce capital and operating
expenses, and actions taken by governments and others to address the COVID-19 pandemic including the
ongoing development and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, and the impact of the pandemic on national
and global economies and markets.
Other demand-related factors. Other factors that may affect the demand for oil, gas, and
petrochemicals, and therefore impact our results, include technological improvements in energy
efficiency; seasonal weather patterns; increased competitiveness of, or government policy support
for, alternative energy sources; changes in technology that alter fuel choices, such as technological
advances in energy storage that make wind and solar more competitive for power generation; changes in
consumer preferences for our products, including consumer demand for alternative fueled or electric
transportation or alternatives to plastic products; and broad-based changes in personal income
levels.
Other supply-related factors. Commodity prices and margins also vary depending on a number of factors
affecting supply. For example, increased supply from the development of new oil and gas supply
sources and technologies to enhance recovery from existing sources tend to reduce commodity prices to
the extent such supply increases are not offset by commensurate growth in demand. Similarly,
increases in industry refining or petrochemical manufacturing capacity relative to demand tend to
reduce margins on the affected products. World oil, gas, and petrochemical supply levels can also be
affected by factors that reduce available supplies, such as adherence by countries to OPEC production
quotas and other agreements among sovereigns, government policies that restrict oil and gas
production or increase associated costs, and the occurrence of wars, hostile actions, natural
disasters, disruptions in competitors’ operations, logistics constraints or unexpected unavailability
of distribution channels that may disrupt supplies. Technological change can also alter the relative
costs for competitors to find, produce, and refine oil and gas and to manufacture petrochemicals.
Other market factors. ExxonMobil’s business results are also exposed to potential negative impacts
due to changes in interest rates, inflation, currency exchange rates, and other local or regional
market conditions.
 2 
 Government and Political Factors 
ExxonMobil’s results can be adversely affected by political or regulatory developments affecting our
operations.
Access limitations. A number of countries limit access to their oil and gas resources, including by
restricting leasing or permitting activities, or may place resources off-limits from development
altogether. Restrictions on production of oil and gas could increase to the extent governments view
such measures as a viable approach for pursuing national and global energy and climate policies.
Restrictions on foreign investment in the oil and gas sector tend to increase in times of high
commodity prices, when national governments may have less need of outside sources of private capital.
Many countries also restrict the import or export of certain products based on point of origin.
Restrictions on doing business. ExxonMobil is subject to laws and sanctions imposed by the United
States or by other jurisdictions where we do business that may prohibit ExxonMobil or certain of its
affiliates from doing business in certain countries, or restricting the kind of business that may be
conducted. Such restrictions may provide a competitive advantage to competitors who may not be
subject to comparable restrictions.
Lack of legal certainty. Some countries in which we do business lack well-developed legal systems, or
have not yet adopted, or may be unable to maintain, clear regulatory frameworks for oil and gas
development. Lack of legal certainty exposes our operations to increased risk of adverse or
unpredictable actions by government officials, and also makes it more difficult for us to enforce our
contracts. In some cases these risks can be partially offset by agreements to arbitrate disputes in
an international forum, but the adequacy of this remedy may still depend on the local legal system to
enforce an award.
Regulatory and litigation risks. Even in countries with well-developed legal systems where ExxonMobil
does business, we remain exposed to changes in law or interpretation of settled law (including
changes that result from international treaties and accords) that could adversely affect our results,
such as:
• increases in taxes, duties, or government royalty rates (including retroactive claims);
• price controls;
• changes in environmental regulations or other laws that increase our cost of compliance or reduce
or delay available business opportunities (including changes in laws affecting offshore drilling
operations, water use, methane emissions, hydraulic fracturing or use of plastics);
• actions by regulators or other political actors to delay or deny necessary licenses and permits or
restrict the transportation of our products;
• adoption of regulations mandating efficiency standards, the use of alternative fuels or
uncompetitive fuel components;
• adoption of government payment transparency regulations that could require us to disclose
competitively sensitive commercial information, or that could cause us to violate the non-disclosure
laws of other countries; and
• government actions to cancel contracts, re-denominate the official currency, renounce or default on
obligations, renegotiate terms unilaterally, or expropriate assets.
Legal remedies available to compensate us for expropriation or other takings may be inadequate.
We also may be adversely affected by the outcome of litigation, especially in countries such as the
United States in which very large and unpredictable punitive damage awards may occur; by government
enforcement proceedings alleging non-compliance with applicable laws or regulations; or by state and
local government actors as well as private plaintiffs acting in parallel that attempt to use the
legal system to promote public policy agendas, gain political notoriety, or obtain monetary awards
from the Company.
Security concerns. Successful operation of particular facilities or projects may be disrupted by
civil unrest, acts of sabotage or terrorism, cybersecurity attacks, and other local security
concerns. Such concerns may require us to incur greater costs for security or to shut down operations
for a period of time.
Climate change and greenhouse gas restrictions. Driven by concern over the risks of climate change, a
number of countries have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, regulatory frameworks to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions or production and use of oil and gas. These include adoption of cap and
trade regimes, carbon taxes, trade tariffs, minimum renewable usage requirements, restrictive
permitting, increased efficiency standards, and incentives or mandates for renewable energy.
Political and other actors and their agents also increasingly seek to advance climate change
objectives indirectly, such as by seeking to reduce the availability of or increase the cost for,
financing and investment in the oil and gas sector and taking actions intended to promote changes in
business strategy for oil and gas companies. Depending on how policies are formulated and applied,
they could have the potential to negatively affect investment returns, make our products more
expensive or less competitive, lengthen project implementation times, and reduce demand for
hydrocarbons, as well as shift hydrocarbon demand toward relatively lower-carbon sources such as
natural gas. Current and pending greenhouse gas regulations or policies may also increase our
compliance costs, such as for monitoring or sequestering emissions.
 3 
Alternative energy. Many governments are providing tax advantages and other subsidies to support
transitioning to alternative energy sources or are mandating the use of specific fuels or
technologies. Governments and others are also promoting research into new technologies to reduce the
cost and increase the scalability of alternative energy sources. We are conducting our own research
both in-house and by working with more than 80 leading universities around the world, including the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Princeton University, The University of Texas, and Stanford
University in the U.S., and in Singapore with Nanyang Technological Institute and the National
University. Our research projects focus on developing advanced biofuels and hydrogen, carbon capture
and storage, breakthrough energy efficiency processes, advanced energy-saving materials, and other
technologies in collaboration with our partners including Synthetic Genomics, FuelCell Energy and
Global Thermostat. Our future results may depend in part on the success of our research efforts and
on our ability to adapt and apply the strengths of our current business model to providing the energy
products of the future in a cost-competitive manner. See “Operational and Other Factors” below.
 Operational and Other Factors 
In addition to external economic and political factors, our future business results also depend on
our ability to manage successfully those factors that are at least in part within our control. The
extent to which we manage these factors will impact our performance relative to competition. For
projects in which we are not the operator, we depend on the management effectiveness of one or more
co-venturers whom we do not control.
Exploration and development program. Our ability to maintain and grow our oil and gas production
depends on the success of our exploration and development efforts. Among other factors, we must
continuously improve our ability to identify the most promising resource prospects and apply our
project management expertise to bring discovered resources on line as scheduled and within budget.
Project and portfolio management. The long-term success of ExxonMobil’s Upstream, Downstream, and
Chemical businesses depends on complex, long-term, capital intensive projects. These projects in turn
require a high degree of project management expertise to maximize efficiency. Specific factors that
can affect the performance of major projects include our ability to: negotiate successfully with
joint venturers, partners, governments, suppliers, customers, or others; model and optimize reservoir
performance; develop markets for project outputs, whether through long-term contracts or the
development of effective spot markets; manage changes in operating conditions and costs, including
costs of third party equipment or services such as drilling rigs and shipping; prevent, to the extent
possible, and respond effectively to unforeseen technical difficulties that could delay project
startup or cause unscheduled project downtime; and influence the performance of project operators
where ExxonMobil does not perform that role. In addition to the effective management of individual
projects, ExxonMobil’s success, including our ability to mitigate risk and provide attractive returns
to shareholders, depends on our ability to successfully manage our overall portfolio, including
diversification among types and locations of our projects and strategies to divest assets. We may not
be able to divest assets at a price or on the timeline we contemplate in our strategies.
Additionally, we may retain certain liabilities following a divestment and could be held liable for
past use or for different liabilities than anticipated.
The term “project” as used in this report can refer to a variety of different activities and does not
necessarily have the same meaning as in any government payment transparency reports.
Operational efficiency. An important component of ExxonMobil’s competitive performance, especially
given the commodity-based nature of many of our businesses, is our ability to operate efficiently,
including our ability to manage expenses and improve production yields on an ongoing basis. This
requires continuous management focus, including technology improvements, cost control, productivity
enhancements, regular reappraisal of our asset portfolio, and the recruitment, development, and
retention of high caliber employees.
Research and development and technological change. To maintain our competitive position, especially
in light of the technological nature of our businesses and the need for continuous efficiency
improvement, ExxonMobil’s research and development organizations must be successful and able to adapt
to a changing market and policy environment, including developing technologies to help reduce
greenhouse gas emissions. To remain competitive we must also continuously adapt and capture the
benefits of new and emerging technologies, including successfully applying advances in the ability to
process very large amounts of data to our businesses.
Safety, business controls, and environmental risk management. Our results depend on management’s
ability to minimize the inherent risks of oil, gas, and petrochemical operations, to control
effectively our business activities, and to minimize the potential for human error. We apply rigorous
management systems and continuous focus on workplace safety and avoiding spills or other adverse
environmental events. For example, we work to minimize spills through a combined program of effective
operations integrity management, ongoing upgrades, key equipment replacements, and comprehensive
inspection and surveillance. Similarly, we are implementing cost-effective new technologies and
adopting new operating practices to reduce air emissions, not only in response to government
requirements but also to address community priorities. We also maintain a disciplined framework of
internal controls and apply a controls management system for monitoring compliance with this
framework. Substantial liabilities and other adverse impacts could result if our management systems
and controls do not function as intended.
 4 
Cybersecurity. ExxonMobil is regularly subject to attempted cybersecurity disruptions from a variety
of threat actors including state-sponsored actors. ExxonMobil’s defensive preparedness includes
multi-layered technological capabilities for prevention and detection of cybersecurity disruptions;
non-technological measures such as threat information sharing with governmental and industry groups;
internal training and awareness campaigns including routine testing of employee awareness and an
emphasis on resiliency including business response and recovery. If the measures we are taking to
protect against cybersecurity disruptions prove to be insufficient or if our proprietary data is
otherwise not protected, ExxonMobil as well as our customers, employees, or third parties could be
adversely affected. Cybersecurity disruptions could cause physical harm to people or the environment;
damage or destroy assets; compromise business systems; result in proprietary information being
altered, lost, or stolen; result in employee, customer, or third-party information being compromised;
or otherwise disrupt our business operations. We could incur significant costs to remedy the effects
of a major cybersecurity disruption in addition to costs in connection with resulting regulatory
actions, litigation or reputational harm.
Preparedness. Our operations may be disrupted by severe weather events, natural disasters, human
error, and similar events. For example, hurricanes may damage our offshore production facilities or
coastal refining and petrochemical plants in vulnerable areas. Our facilities are designed,
constructed, and operated to withstand a variety of extreme climatic and other conditions, with
safety factors built in to cover a number of engineering uncertainties, including those associated
with wave, wind, and current intensity, marine ice flow patterns, permafrost stability, storm surge
magnitude, temperature extremes, extreme rainfall events, and earthquakes. Our consideration of
changing weather conditions and inclusion of safety factors in design covers the engineering
uncertainties that climate change and other events may potentially introduce. Our ability to mitigate
the adverse impacts of these events depends in part upon the effectiveness of our robust facility
engineering as well as our rigorous disaster preparedness and response, and business continuity
planning.
Insurance limitations. The ability of the Corporation to insure against many of the risks it faces as
described in this Item 1A is limited by the capacity of the applicable insurance markets, which may
not be sufficient.
Competition. As noted in Item 1 above, the energy and petrochemical industries are highly
competitive. We face competition not only from other private firms, but also from state-owned
companies that are increasingly competing for opportunities outside of their home countries and as
partners with other private firms. In some cases, these state-owned companies may pursue
opportunities in furtherance of strategic objectives of their government owners, with less focus on
financial returns than companies owned by private shareholders, such as ExxonMobil. Technology and
expertise provided by industry service companies may also enhance the competitiveness of firms that
may not have the internal resources and capabilities of ExxonMobil or reduce the need for resource-
owning countries to partner with private-sector oil and gas companies in order to monetize national
resources.
Reputation. Our reputation is an important corporate asset. An operating incident, significant
cybersecurity disruption, change in consumer views concerning our products, or other adverse event
such as those described in this Item 1A may have a negative impact on our reputation, which in turn
could make it more difficult for us to compete successfully for new opportunities, obtain necessary
regulatory approvals, obtain financing, or could reduce consumer demand for our branded products.
ExxonMobil’s reputation may also be harmed by events which negatively affect the image of our
industry as a whole.
Projections, estimates, and descriptions of ExxonMobil’s plans and objectives included or
incorporated in Items 1, 1A, 2, 7 and 7A of this report are forward-looking statements. Actual future
results, including project completion dates, production rates, capital expenditures, costs, and
business plans could differ materially due to, among other things, the factors discussed above and
elsewhere in this report.

Information with regard to oil and gas producing activities follows:
 1. Disclosure of Reserves 
A. Summary of Oil and Gas Reserves at Year-End 2020
The table below summarizes the oil-equivalent proved reserves in each geographic area and by product
type for consolidated subsidiaries and equity companies. Natural gas is converted to an oil-
equivalent basis at six billion cubic feet per one million barrels. The Corporation has reported
proved reserves on the basis of the average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month during
the last 12-month period. Primarily as a result of very low prices during 2020 and the effects of
reductions in capital expenditures, under the SEC definition of proved reserves, certain quantities
of crude oil, bitumen, and natural gas that qualified as proved reserves in prior years did not
qualify as proved reserves at year-end 2020. Otherwise, no major discovery or other favorable or
adverse event has occurred since December 31, 2020, that would cause a significant change in the
estimated proved reserves as of that date.

In the preceding reserves information, consolidated subsidiary and equity company reserves are
reported separately. However, the Corporation operates its business with the same view of equity
company reserves as it has for reserves from consolidated subsidiaries.
The Corporation anticipates several projects will come online over the next few years providing
additional production capacity. However, actual volumes will vary from year to year due to the timing
of individual project start-ups; operational outages; reservoir performance; performance of enhanced
oil recovery projects; regulatory changes; the impact of fiscal and commercial terms; asset sales;
weather events; price effects on production sharing contracts; changes in the amount and timing of
capital investments that may vary depending on the oil and gas price environment; and other factors
described in Item 1A. Risk Factors.
The estimation of proved reserves, which is based on the requirement of reasonable certainty, is an
ongoing process based on rigorous technical evaluations, commercial and market assessments and
detailed analysis of well and reservoir information such as flow rates and reservoir pressures.
Furthermore, the Corporation only records proved reserves for projects which have received
significant funding commitments by management toward the development of the reserves. Although the
Corporation is reasonably certain that proved reserves will be produced, the timing and amount
recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects,
reservoir performance, regulatory approvals, government policies, consumer preferences, and
significant changes in crude oil and natural gas price levels. In addition, proved reserves could be
affected by an extended period of low prices which could reduce the level of the Corporation’s
capital spending and also impact our partners’ capacity to fund their share of joint projects.
During the first and second quarters of 2020, the balance of supply and demand for petroleum and
petrochemical products experienced two significant disruptive effects. On the demand side, the
COVID-19 pandemic spread rapidly through most areas of the world resulting in substantial reductions
in consumer and business activity and significantly reduced demand for crude oil, natural gas, and
petroleum products. This reduction in demand coincided with announcements of increased production in
certain key oil-producing countries which led to increases in inventory levels and sharp declines in
prices for crude oil, natural gas, and petroleum products. Market conditions continued to reflect
considerable uncertainty throughout 2020.
As noted above, certain quantities of crude oil, bitumen, and natural gas that qualified as proved
reserves in prior years did not qualify as proved reserves at year-end 2020. Amounts no longer
qualifying as proved reserves include 3.1 billion barrels of bitumen at Kearl, 0.6 billion barrels of
bitumen at Cold Lake, and 0.5 billion oil-equivalent barrels in the United States. The Corporation's
near-term reduction in capital expenditures resulted in a net reduction to estimates of proved
reserves of approximately 1.5 billion oil-equivalent barrels, mainly related to unconventional
drilling in the United States. Among the factors that could result in portions of these amounts being
recognized again as proved reserves at some point in the future are a recovery in the SEC price
basis, cost reductions, operating efficiencies, and increases in planned capital spending.
B. Technologies Used in Establishing Proved Reserves Additions in 2020
Additions to ExxonMobil’s proved reserves in 2020 were based on estimates generated through the
integration of available and appropriate geological, engineering and production data, utilizing well-
established technologies that have been demonstrated in the field to yield repeatable and consistent
results.
Data used in these integrated assessments included information obtained directly from the subsurface
via wellbores, such as well logs, reservoir core samples, fluid samples, static and dynamic pressure
information, production test data, and surveillance and performance information. The data utilized
also included subsurface information obtained through indirect measurements including high-quality
3-D and 4-D seismic data, calibrated with available well control information. The tools used to
interpret the data included proprietary seismic processing software, proprietary reservoir modeling
and simulation software, and commercially available data analysis packages.
In some circumstances, where appropriate analog reservoirs were available, reservoir parameters from
these analogs were used to increase the quality of and confidence in the reserves estimates.
 7 
C. Qualifications of Reserves Technical Oversight Group and Internal Controls over Proved Reserves
ExxonMobil has a dedicated Global Reserves and Resources group that provides technical oversight and
is separate from the operating organization. Primary responsibilities of this group include oversight
of the reserves estimation process for compliance with Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules
and regulations, review of annual changes in reserves estimates, and the reporting of ExxonMobil’s
proved reserves. This group also maintains the official company reserves estimates for ExxonMobil’s
proved reserves of crude oil, natural gas liquids, bitumen, synthetic oil, and natural gas. In
addition, the group provides training to personnel involved in the reserves estimation and reporting
process within ExxonMobil and its affiliates. The Manager of the Global Reserves and Resources group
has more than 30 years of experience in reservoir engineering and reserves assessment, has a degree
in Engineering and currently serves on the Oil and Gas Reserves Committee of the Society of Petroleum
Engineers (SPE). The group is staffed with individuals that have an average of more than 15 years of
technical experience in the petroleum industry, including expertise in the classification and
categorization of reserves under SEC guidelines. This group includes individuals who hold degrees in
either Engineering or Geology.
The Global Reserves and Resources group maintains a central database containing the official company
reserves estimates. Appropriate controls, including limitations on database access and update
capabilities, are in place to ensure data integrity within this central database. An annual review of
the system’s controls is performed by internal audit. Key components of the reserves estimation
process include technical evaluations, commercial and market assessments, analysis of well and field
performance, and long-standing approval guidelines. No changes may be made to the reserves estimates
in the central database, including additions of any new initial reserves estimates or subsequent
revisions, unless these changes have been thoroughly reviewed and evaluated by duly authorized
geoscience and engineering professionals within the operating organization. In addition, changes to
reserves estimates that exceed certain thresholds require further review and approval by the
appropriate level of management within the operating organization before the changes may be made in
the central database. Endorsement by the Global Reserves and Resources group for all proved reserves
changes is a mandatory component of this review process. After all changes are made, reviews are held
with senior management for final endorsement.
 2. Proved Undeveloped Reserves 
At year-end 2020, approximately 5.0 billion oil-equivalent barrels (GOEB) of ExxonMobil’s proved
reserves were classified as proved undeveloped. This represents 33 percent of the 15.2 GOEB reported
in proved reserves. This compares to the 7.7 GOEB of proved undeveloped reserves reported at the end
of 2019. During the year, ExxonMobil conducted development activities that resulted in the transfer
of approximately 0.9 GOEB from proved undeveloped to proved developed reserves by year end. The
largest transfers were related to development activities in the United States, Qatar, the United Arab
Emirates, and Guyana. During 2020, extensions, primarily in the United States and Canada, resulted in
an addition of approximately 0.5 GOEB of proved undeveloped reserves. Also, as a result of very low
prices during 2020 and the effects of reductions in capital expenditures, the Corporation
reclassified approximately 2.3 GOEB of proved undeveloped reserves which no longer met the SEC
definition of proved reserves, primarily in the United States and Canada.
Overall, investments of $10.7 billion were made by the Corporation during 2020 to progress the
development of reported proved undeveloped reserves, including $10.4 billion for oil and gas
producing activities, along with additional investments for other non-oil and gas producing
activities such as the construction of support infrastructure and other related facilities. These
investments represented 74 percent of the $14.4 billion in total reported Upstream capital and
exploration expenditures.
One of ExxonMobil’s requirements for reporting proved reserves is that management has made
significant funding commitments toward the development of the reserves. ExxonMobil has a disciplined
investment strategy and many major fields require long lead-time in order to be developed.
Development projects typically take several years from the time of recording proved undeveloped
reserves to the start of production and can exceed five years for large and complex projects. Proved
undeveloped reserves in Australia, Kazakhstan, the United States, and the United Arab Emirates have
remained undeveloped for five years or more primarily due to constraints on the capacity of
infrastructure, as well as the time required to complete development for very large projects. The
Corporation is reasonably certain that these proved reserves will be produced; however, the timing
and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development
projects, reservoir performance, regulatory approvals, government policies, consumer preferences, the
pace of co-venturer/government funding, changes in the amount and timing of capital investments, and
significant changes in crude oil and natural gas price levels. Of the proved undeveloped reserves
that have been reported for five or more years, over 80 percent are contained in the aforementioned
countries. In Australia, proved undeveloped reserves are associated with future compression for the
Gorgon Jansz LNG project. In Kazakhstan, the proved undeveloped reserves are related to the remainder
of the Tengizchevroil joint venture development that includes a production license in the Tengiz -
Korolev field complex. The Tengizchevroil joint venture is producing, and proved undeveloped reserves
will continue to move to proved developed as approved development phases progress. In the United Arab
Emirates, proved undeveloped reserves are associated with an approved development plan and continued
drilling investment for the producing Upper Zakum field.

Average production prices have been calculated by using sales quantities from the Corporation’s own
production as the divisor. Average production costs have been computed by using net production
quantities for the divisor. The volumes of crude oil and natural gas liquids (NGL) production used
for this computation are shown in the oil and gas production table in section 3.A. The volumes of
natural gas used in the calculation are the production volumes of natural gas available for sale and
are also shown in section 3.A. The natural gas available for sale volumes are different from those
shown in the reserves table in the “Oil and Gas Reserves” part of the “Supplemental Information on
Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Activities” portion of the Financial Section of this report
due to volumes consumed or flared. Natural gas is converted to an oil-equivalent basis at six million
cubic feet per one thousand barrels.

B. Exploratory and Development Activities Regarding Oil and Gas Resources Extracted by Mining
Technologies
Syncrude Operations. Syncrude is a joint venture established to recover shallow deposits of oil sands
using open-pit mining methods to extract the crude bitumen, and then upgrade it to produce a high-
quality, light (32 degrees API), sweet, synthetic crude oil. Imperial Oil Limited is the owner of a
25 percent interest in the joint venture. Exxon Mobil Corporation has a 69.6 percent interest in
Imperial Oil Limited. In 2020, the company’s share of net production of synthetic crude oil was about
68 thousand barrels per day and share of net acreage was about 55 thousand acres in the Athabasca oil
sands deposit.
Kearl Operations. Kearl is a joint venture established to recover shallow deposits of oil sands using
open-pit mining methods to extract the crude bitumen. Imperial Oil Limited holds a 70.96 percent
interest in the joint venture and ExxonMobil Canada Properties holds the other 29.04 percent. Exxon
Mobil Corporation has a 69.6 percent interest in Imperial Oil Limited and a 100 percent interest in
ExxonMobil Canada Properties. Kearl is comprised of six oil sands leases covering about 49 thousand
acres in the Athabasca oil sands deposit.
Kearl is located approximately 40 miles north of Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada. Bitumen is extracted
from oil sands and processed through bitumen extraction and froth treatment trains. The product, a
blend of bitumen and diluent, is shipped to our refineries and to other third parties. Diluent is
natural gas condensate or other light hydrocarbons added to the crude bitumen to facilitate
transportation by pipeline and rail. During 2020, average net production at Kearl was about 219
thousand barrels per day.
Primarily as a result of very low prices during 2020, under the SEC definition of proved reserves,
the entire 3.1 billion barrels of bitumen at Kearl did not qualify as proved reserves at year-end
2020. Among the factors that could result in portions of these amounts being recognized again as
proved reserves at some point in the future are a recovery in the SEC price basis, cost reductions,
and/or operating efficiencies.

in the southern PNG Highlands, onshore and offshore pipelines, and a 6.9 million tonnes per year
liquefied natural gas facility near Port Moresby.
 WORLDWIDE EXPLORATION 
At year-end 2020, exploration activities were under way in several areas in which ExxonMobil has no
established production operations and thus are not included above. A total of 29.8 million net acres
were held at year-end 2020 and 0.7 net exploration wells were completed during the year in these
countries.
 6. Delivery Commitments 
ExxonMobil sells crude oil and natural gas from its producing operations under a variety of
contractual obligations, some of which may specify the delivery of a fixed and determinable quantity
for periods longer than one year. ExxonMobil also enters into natural gas sales contracts where the
source of the natural gas used to fulfill the contract can be a combination of our own production and
the spot market. Worldwide, we are contractually committed to deliver approximately 31 million
barrels of oil and 2,600 billion cubic feet of natural gas for the period from 2021 through 2023. We
expect to fulfill the majority of these delivery commitments with production from our proved
developed reserves. Any remaining commitments will be fulfilled with production from our proved
undeveloped reserves and purchases on the open market as necessary.

ExxonMobil’s investment in developed and undeveloped acreage is comprised of numerous concessions,
blocks, and leases. The terms and conditions under which the Corporation maintains exploration and/or
production rights to the acreage are property-specific, contractually defined, and vary significantly
from property to property. Work programs are designed to ensure that the exploration potential of any
property is fully evaluated before expiration. In some instances, the Corporation may elect to
relinquish acreage in advance of the contractual expiration date if the evaluation process is
complete and there is not a business basis for extension. In cases where additional time may be
required to fully evaluate acreage, the Corporation has generally been successful in obtaining
extensions. The scheduled expiration of leases and concessions for undeveloped acreage over the next
three years is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the Corporation.
 D. Summary of Acreage Terms 
 UNITED STATES 
Oil and gas exploration and production rights are acquired from mineral interest owners through a
lease. Mineral interest owners include the Federal and State governments, as well as private mineral
interest owners. Leases typically have an exploration period ranging from one to ten years, and a
production period that normally remains in effect until production ceases. Under certain
circumstances, a lease may be held beyond its exploration term even if production has not commenced.
In some instances regarding private property, a “fee interest” is acquired where the underlying
mineral interests are owned outright.
 CANADA / OTHER AMERICAS 
Canada
Exploration licenses or leases in onshore areas are acquired for varying periods of time with
renewals or extensions possible. These licenses or leases entitle the holder to continue existing
licenses or leases upon completing specified work. In general, these license and lease agreements are
held as long as there is proven production capability on the licenses and leases. Exploration
licenses in offshore eastern Canada and the Beaufort Sea are held by work commitments of various
amounts and rentals. They are valid for a term of nine years. Offshore production licenses are valid
for 25 years, with rights of extension for continued production. Significant discovery licenses in
the offshore, relating to currently undeveloped discoveries, do not have a definite term.
Argentina
The Federal Hydrocarbon Law was amended in 2014. Pursuant to the amended law, the production term for
an onshore unconventional concession is 35 years, and 25 years for a conventional concession, with
unlimited 10-year extensions possible, once a field has been developed. In 2019, the government
granted three offshore exploration licenses, with terms of eight years, divided into two exploration
periods of four years, with an optional extension of five years for each license. Two onshore
exploration concessions were initially granted prior to the amendment and are governed under
Provincial Law with expiration terms through 2024.
Guyana
The Petroleum (Exploration and Production) Act authorizes the government of Guyana to grant petroleum
prospecting and production licenses and to enter into petroleum agreements for the exploration and
production of hydrocarbons. Petroleum agreements provide for an exploration period of up to 10 years
and a production period of 20 years, with a 10-year extension.
 EUROPE 
Germany
Exploration concessions are granted for an initial maximum period of five years, with an unlimited
number of extensions up to three years each. Extensions are subject to specific minimum work
commitments. Production licenses are normally granted for 20 to 25 years with multiple possible
extensions subject to production on the license.
Netherlands
Under the Mining Law, effective January 1, 2003, exploration and production licenses for both onshore
and offshore areas are issued for a period as explicitly defined in the license. The term is based on
the period of time necessary to perform the activities for which the license is issued. License
conditions are stipulated in the license and are based on the Mining Law.
Production rights granted prior to January 1, 2003, remain subject to their existing terms, and
differ slightly for onshore and offshore areas. Onshore production licenses issued prior to 1988 were
indefinite; from 1988 they were issued for a period as explicitly defined in the license, ranging
from 35 to 45 years. Offshore production licenses issued before 1976 were issued for a fixed period
of 40 years; from 1976 they were again issued for a period as explicitly defined in the license,
ranging from 15 to 40 years.
 20 
United Kingdom
Acreage terms are fixed by the government and are periodically changed. For example, many of the
early licenses issued under the first four licensing rounds provided an initial term of six years
with relinquishment of at least one-half of the original area at the end of the initial term, subject
to extension for a further 40 years. At the end of any such 40-year term, licenses may continue in
producing areas until cessation of production; or licenses may continue in development areas for
periods agreed on a case-by-case basis until they become producing areas; or licenses terminate in
all other areas. The majority of traditional licenses currently issued have an initial exploration
term of four years with a second term extension of four years, and a final production term of 18
years, with a mandatory relinquishment of 50 percent of the acreage after the initial term and of all
acreage that is not covered by a development plan at the end of the second term.
Terms for exploration acreage in technically challenged areas are governed by frontier production
licenses, generally covering a larger initial area than traditional licenses, with an initial
exploration term of six or nine years with a second term extension of six years, and a final
production term of 18 years, with relinquishment of 75 percent of the original area after three years
and 50 percent of the remaining acreage after the next three years. Innovate licenses issued replace
traditional and frontier licenses and offer greater flexibility with respect to periods and work
program commitments.
 AFRICA 
Angola
Exploration and production activities are governed by either production sharing agreements or other
contracts with initial exploration terms ranging from three to four years with options to extend from
one to five years. The production periods range from 20 to 30 years, and the agreements generally
provide for negotiated extensions.
Chad
Exploration permits are issued for a period of five years, and are renewable for one or two further
five-year periods. The terms and conditions of the permits, including relinquishment obligations, are
specified in a negotiated convention. The production term is 30 years and in 2017 was extended by 20
years to 2050.
Equatorial Guinea
Exploration, development and production activities are governed by production sharing contracts
(PSCs) negotiated with the State Ministry of Mines and Hydrocarbons. A new PSC was ratified in 2018;
the initial exploration period is five years for oil and gas, with multi-year extensions available at
the discretion of the Ministry and limited relinquishments in the absence of commercial discoveries.
The production period for crude oil ranges from 25 to 30 years, while the production period for
natural gas ranges from 25 to 50 years.
Mozambique
Exploration and production activities are generally governed by concession contracts with the
Government of the Republic of Mozambique, represented by the Ministry of Mineral Resources and
Energy. An interest in Area 4 offshore Mozambique was acquired in 2017. Terms for Area 4 are governed
by the Exploration and Production Concession Contract (EPCC) for Area 4 Offshore of the Rovuma Block.
The EPCC expires 30 years after an approved plan of development becomes effective for a given
discovery area.
In 2018, an interest was acquired in offshore blocks, A5-B, Z5-C and Z5-D. Terms for the three blocks
are governed by their respective EPCCs, which have an initial exploration phase that expires in 2022
with the possibility of two additional exploration phases expiring in 2024 and 2026. The EPCCs
provide a development and production period that expires 30 years after the approval of a plan of
development.
Nigeria
Exploration and production activities in the deepwater offshore areas are typically governed by
production sharing contracts (PSCs) with the national oil company, the Nigerian National Petroleum
Corporation (NNPC). NNPC typically holds the underlying Oil Prospecting License (OPL) and any
resulting Oil Mining Lease (OML). The terms of the PSCs are generally 30 years, including a 10-year
exploration period (an initial exploration phase that can be divided into multiple optional periods)
covered by an OPL. Upon commercial discovery, an OPL may be converted to an OML. Partial
relinquishment is required under the PSC at the end of the 10-year exploration period, and OMLs have
a 20-year production period that may be extended.
Some exploration activities are carried out in deepwater by joint ventures with local companies
holding interests in an OPL. OPLs in deepwater offshore areas are valid for 10 years, while in all
other areas the licenses are for five years. Demonstrating a commercial discovery is the basis for
conversion of an OPL to an OML.
 21 
OMLs granted prior to the 1969 Petroleum Act (i.e., under the Mineral Oils Act 1914, repealed by the
1969 Petroleum Act) were for 30 years onshore and 40 years in offshore areas and have been renewed,
effective December 1, 2008, for a further period of 20 years, with a further renewal option of 20
years. Operations under these pre-1969 OMLs are conducted under a joint venture agreement with NNPC
rather than a PSC. Commercial terms applicable to the existing joint venture oil production are
defined by the Petroleum Profits Tax Act.
OMLs granted under the 1969 Petroleum Act, which include all deepwater OMLs, have a maximum term of
20 years without distinction for onshore or offshore location and are renewable, upon 12-months
written notice, for another period of 20 years. OMLs not held by NNPC are also subject to a mandatory
50-percent relinquishment after the first 10 years of their duration.
 ASIA 
Azerbaijan
The production sharing agreement (PSA) for the development of the Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli field was
established for an initial period of 30 years starting from the PSA execution date in 1994. The PSA
was amended in September 2017 to extend the term by 25 years to 2049.
Other exploration and production activities are governed by PSAs negotiated with the national oil
company of Azerbaijan. The exploration period typically consists of three or four years with the
possibility of a one to three-year extension. The production period, which includes development, is
for 25 years or 35 years with the possibility of one or two five-year extensions.
Indonesia
Exploration and production activities in Indonesia are generally governed by cooperation contracts,
usually in the form of a production sharing contract (PSC), negotiated with BPMIGAS, a government
agency established in 2002 to manage upstream oil and gas activities. In 2012, Indonesia’s
Constitutional Court ruled certain articles of law relating to BPMIGAS to be unconstitutional, but
stated that all existing PSCs signed with BPMIGAS should remain in force until their expiry, and the
functions and duties previously performed by BPMIGAS are to be carried out by the relevant Ministry
of the Government of Indonesia until the promulgation of a new oil and gas law. By presidential
decree, SKKMIGAS became the interim successor to BPMIGAS. The current PSCs have an exploration period
of six years, which can be extended up to 10 years, and an exploitation period of 20 years. PSCs
generally require the contractor to relinquish 10 to 20 percent of the contract area after three
years and generally allow the contractor to retain no more than 50 to 80 percent of the original
contract area after six years, depending on the acreage and terms.
Iraq
Development and production activities in the state-owned oil and gas fields are governed by contracts
with regional oil companies of the Iraqi Ministry of Oil. An ExxonMobil affiliate entered into a
contract with Basra Oil Company of the Iraqi Ministry of Oil for the rights to participate in the
development and production activities of the West Qurna Phase I oil and gas field effective March 1,
2010. The term of the contract is 20 years with the right to extend for five years. The contract
provides for cost recovery plus per-barrel fees for incremental production above specified levels.
Exploration and production activities in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq are governed by production
sharing contracts (PSCs) negotiated with the regional government of Kurdistan in 2011. The
exploration term is for five years, with extensions available as provided by the PSCs and at the
discretion of the regional government of Kurdistan. Current PSCs remain in effect by agreement of the
regional government to allow additional time for exploration or evaluation of commerciality. The
production period is 20 years with the right to extend for five years.
Kazakhstan
Onshore exploration and production activities are governed by the production license, exploration
license, and joint venture agreements negotiated with the Republic of Kazakhstan. Existing production
operations have a 40-year production period that commenced in 1993.
Offshore exploration and production activities are governed by a production sharing agreement
negotiated with the Republic of Kazakhstan. The exploration period is six years followed by separate
appraisal periods for each discovery. The production period for each discovery, which includes
development, is 20 years from the date of declaration of commerciality with the possibility of two
10-year extensions.
Malaysia
Production activities are governed by production sharing contracts (PSCs) negotiated with the
national oil company. The PSCs have production terms of 25 years. Extensions are generally subject to
the national oil company’s prior written approval.
 22 
Qatar
The State of Qatar grants gas production development project rights to develop and supply gas from
the offshore North Field to permit the economic development and production of gas reserves sufficient
to satisfy the gas and LNG sales obligations of these projects.
Russia
Terms for ExxonMobil’s Sakhalin acreage are fixed by the current production sharing agreement between
the Russian government and the Sakhalin-1 consortium, of which ExxonMobil is the operator.
Thailand
The Petroleum Act of 1971 allows production under ExxonMobil’s concessions for 30 years with a
10-year extension at terms generally prevalent at the time. The term of one of the two concessions
expires in 2021.
United Arab Emirates
An interest in the development and production activities of the offshore Upper Zakum field was
acquired in 2006. In 2017, the governing agreements were extended to 2051.
 AUSTRALIA / OCEANIA 
Australia
Exploration and production activities conducted offshore in Commonwealth waters are governed by
Federal legislation. Exploration permits are granted for an initial term of six years with two
possible five-year renewal periods. Retention leases may be granted for resources that are not
commercially viable at the time of application, but are expected to become commercially viable within
15 years. These are granted for periods of five years and renewals may be requested. Prior to July
1998, production licenses were granted initially for 21 years, with a further renewal of 21 years and
thereafter indefinitely, i.e., for the life of the field. Effective from July 1998, new production
licenses are granted indefinitely. In each case, a production license may be terminated if no
production operations have been carried on for five years.
Papua New Guinea
Exploration and production activities are governed by the Oil and Gas Act. Petroleum prospecting
licenses are granted for an initial term of six years with a five-year extension possible (an
additional extension of three years is possible in certain circumstances). Generally, a 50-percent
relinquishment of the license area is required at the end of the initial six-year term, if extended.
Petroleum development licenses are granted for an initial 25-year period. An extension of up to 20
years may be granted at the Minister’s discretion. Petroleum retention licenses may be granted for
gas resources that are not commercially viable at the time of application, but may become
commercially viable within the maximum possible retention time of 15 years. Petroleum retention
licenses are granted for five-year terms, and may be extended, at the Minister’s discretion, twice
for the maximum retention time of 15 years. Extensions of petroleum retention licenses may be for
periods of less than one year, renewable annually, if the Minister considers at the time of extension
that the resources could become commercially viable in less than five years.
