 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
This report contains information that may constitute “forward-looking statements.” Generally, the
words “believe,” “expect,” “intend,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “project,” “will” and similar
expressions identify forward-looking statements, which generally are not historical in nature.
However, the absence of these words or similar expressions does not mean that a statement is not
forward-looking. All statements that address operating performance, events or developments that we
expect or anticipate will occur in the future — including statements relating to volume growth, share
of sales and net income per share growth, and statements expressing general views about future
operating results — are forward-looking statements. Management believes that these forward-looking
statements are reasonable as and when made. However, caution should be taken not to place undue
reliance on any such forward-looking statements because such statements speak only as of the date
when made. Our Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking
statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by
law. In addition, forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that
could cause our Company’s actual results to differ materially from historical experience and our
present expectations or projections. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to,
the possibility that the assumptions used to calculate our estimated aggregate incremental tax and
interest liability related to the potential unfavorable outcome of the ongoing tax dispute with the
United States Internal Revenue Service could significantly change; those described in Part I, “Item
1A. Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this report; and those described from time to time in our future
reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

│ ITEM 1. BUSINESS │
In this report, the terms “The Coca-Cola Company,” “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” mean The Coca-Cola
Company and all entities included in our consolidated financial statements.
 General 
The Coca-Cola Company is a total beverage company, and beverage products bearing our trademarks, sold
in the United States since 1886, are now sold in more than 200 countries and territories. We own or
license and market numerous beverage brands, which we group into the following categories: Trademark
Coca-Cola; sparkling flavors; water, sports, coffee and tea; juice, value-added dairy and plant-based
beverages; and emerging beverages. We own and market five of the world’s top six nonalcoholic
sparkling soft drink brands: Coca-Cola, Sprite, Fanta, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar and Diet Coke/Coca-Cola
Light.
We make our branded beverage products available to consumers throughout the world through our network
of independent bottling partners, distributors, wholesalers and retailers as well as our consolidated
bottling and distribution operations. Beverages bearing trademarks owned by or licensed to the
Company account for 2.2 billion of the estimated 64 billion servings of all beverages consumed
worldwide every day.
We believe our success depends on our ability to connect with consumers by providing them with a wide
variety of beverage options to meet their desires, needs and lifestyles. Our success further depends
on the ability of our people to execute effectively, every day.
We are guided by our purpose, which is to refresh the world and make a difference. Our vision for
growth has three connected pillars:
• Loved Brands. We craft meaningful brands and a choice of drinks that people love and enjoy and that
refresh them in body and spirit.
• Done Sustainably. We grow our business in ways that achieve positive change in the world and build
a more sustainable future for our planet.
• For A Better Shared Future. We invest to improve people’s lives, from our employees to all those
who touch our business system, to our investors, to the broad communities we call home.
The Coca-Cola Company was incorporated in September 1919 under the laws of the State of Delaware and
succeeded to the business of a Georgia corporation with the same name that had been organized in
1892.
 2 
 Operating Segments 
The Company’s operating structure is the basis for our internal financial reporting. Our operating
structure includes the following operating segments:
• Europe, Middle East and Africa
• Latin America
• North America
• Asia Pacific
• Global Ventures
• Bottling Investments
Additionally, our operating structure includes operating units, which sit under our four geographic
operating segments. The operating units are focused on regional and local execution and are highly
interconnected, with the goal of eliminating duplication of resources and scaling new products more
quickly. The operating units work closely with five global marketing category leadership teams to
rapidly scale ideas while staying close to the consumer. The global marketing category leadership
teams primarily focus on innovation as well as marketing efficiency and effectiveness.
Our operating structure also includes Corporate, which consists of two components: (1) a center
focusing on strategic initiatives, policy, governance and scaling global initiatives, and (2) a
platform services organization supporting the operating units, global marketing category leadership
teams and the center by providing efficient and scaled global services and capabilities, including,
but not limited to, transactional work, data management, consumer analytics, digital commerce and
social/digital hubs.
For additional information about our operating segments and Corporate, refer to Note 19 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part II, “Item 8. Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data” of this report.
Except to the extent that differences among operating segments are material to an understanding of
our business taken as a whole, the description of our business in this report is presented on a
consolidated basis.
 Products and Brands 
As used in this report:
• “concentrates” means flavorings and other ingredients which, when combined with water and,
depending on the product, sweeteners (nutritive or non-nutritive) are used to prepare syrups or
finished beverages, and includes powders/minerals for purified water products;
• “syrups” means intermediate products in the beverage manufacturing process produced by combining
concentrates with water and, depending on the product, sweeteners (nutritive or non-nutritive);
• “fountain syrups” means syrups that are sold to fountain retailers, such as restaurants and
convenience stores, which use dispensing equipment to mix the syrups with sparkling or still water at
the time of purchase to produce finished beverages that are served in cups or glasses for immediate
consumption;
• “Company Trademark Beverages” means beverages bearing our trademarks and certain other beverages
bearing trademarks licensed to us by third parties for which we provide marketing support and from
the sale of which we derive an economic benefit; and
• “Trademark Coca-Cola Beverages” or “Trademark Coca-Cola” means nonalcoholic beverages bearing the
trademark Coca-Cola or any trademark that includes Coca-Cola or Coke (that is, Coca-Cola, Diet
Coke/Coca-Cola Light and Coca-Cola Zero Sugar and all their variations and any line extensions,
including caffeine free Diet Coke, Cherry Coke, etc.). Likewise, when we use the capitalized word
“Trademark” together with the name of one of our other beverage products (such as “Trademark Fanta,”
“Trademark Sprite” or “Trademark Simply”), we mean beverages bearing the indicated trademark (that
is, Fanta, Sprite or Simply, respectively) and all its variations and line extensions (such that
“Trademark Fanta” includes Fanta Orange, Fanta Zero Orange, Fanta Zero Sugar, Fanta Apple, etc.;
“Trademark Sprite” includes Sprite, Sprite Zero Sugar, etc.; and “Trademark Simply” includes Simply
Orange, Simply Apple, Simply Grapefruit, etc.).
 3 
Our Company markets, manufactures and sells:
• beverage concentrates, sometimes referred to as “beverage bases,” and syrups, including fountain
syrups (we refer to this part of our business as our “concentrate operations”); and
• finished sparkling soft drinks and other beverages (we refer to this part of our business as our
“finished product operations”).
Generally, finished product operations generate higher net operating revenues but lower gross profit
margins than concentrate operations.
Our concentrate operations typically generate net operating revenues by selling concentrates, syrups
and certain finished beverages to authorized bottling operations (to which we typically refer as our
“bottlers” or our “bottling partners”). Our bottling partners either combine concentrates with still
or sparkling water and sweeteners (depending on the product), or combine syrups with still or
sparkling water, to produce finished beverages. The finished beverages are packaged in authorized
containers, such as cans and refillable and nonrefillable glass and plastic bottles, bearing our
trademarks or trademarks licensed to us and are then sold to retailers directly or, in some cases,
through wholesalers or other bottlers. In addition, outside the United States, our bottling partners
are typically authorized to manufacture fountain syrups, using our concentrates, which they sell to
fountain retailers for use in producing beverages for immediate consumption, or to authorized
fountain wholesalers who in turn sell and distribute the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. Our
concentrate operations are included in our geographic operating segments and our Global Ventures
operating segment.
Our finished product operations generate net operating revenues by selling sparkling soft drinks and
a variety of other finished beverages to retailers or to distributors and wholesalers who in turn
sell the beverages to retailers. These operations consist primarily of our consolidated bottling and
distribution operations, which are included in our Bottling Investments operating segment. In certain
markets, the Company also operates non-bottling finished product operations in which we sell finished
beverages to distributors and wholesalers that are generally not one of the Company’s bottling
partners. These operations are generally included in one of our geographic operating segments or our
Global Ventures operating segment. Additionally, we sell directly to consumers through retail stores
operated by Costa Limited (“Costa”). These sales are included in our Global Ventures operating
segment. In the United States, we manufacture fountain syrups and sell them to fountain retailers,
who use the fountain syrups to produce beverages for immediate consumption, or to authorized fountain
wholesalers or bottling partners who in turn sell the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. These
fountain syrup sales are included in our North America operating segment.
For information regarding net operating revenues and unit case volume related to our concentrate
operations and finished product operations, refer to the heading “Our Business — General” set forth
in Part II, “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations” of this report.
For information regarding how we measure the volume of Company beverage products sold by the Company
and our bottling partners (“Coca-Cola system”), refer to the heading “Operations Review — Beverage
Volume” set forth in Part II, “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations” of this report.
We own and market numerous valuable beverage brands, including the following:
• sparkling soft drinks: Coca-Cola, Diet Coke/Coca-Cola Light, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, Fanta, Fresca,
Schweppes 1 , Sprite and Thums Up;
• water, sports, coffee and tea: Aquarius, Ayataka, BODYARMOR, Ciel, Costa, Dasani, doğadan, FUZE
TEA, Georgia, glacéau smartwater, glacéau vitaminwater, Gold Peak, Ice Dew, I LOHAS, Powerade and
Topo Chico; and
• juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages: AdeS, Del Valle, fairlife, innocent, Minute
Maid, Minute Maid Pulpy and Simply.
1 Schweppes is owned by the Company in certain countries other than the United States.
In addition to the beverage brands we own, we also provide marketing support and otherwise
participate in the sales of other beverage brands through licenses, joint ventures and strategic
relationships. For example, certain Coca-Cola system bottlers distribute certain brands of Monster
Beverage Corporation (“Monster”), primarily Monster Energy, in designated territories in the United
States, Canada and other international territories pursuant to distribution coordination agreements
between the Company and Monster and related distribution agreements between Monster and Coca-Cola
system bottlers.
Consumer demand determines the optimal menu of Company product offerings. Consumer demand can vary
from one market to another and can change over time within a single market. Our Company continually
seeks to further optimize its portfolio of brands, products and services in order to create and
satisfy consumer demand in every market.
 4 
 Distribution System 
We make our branded beverage products available to consumers in more than 200 countries and
territories through our network of independent bottling partners, distributors, wholesalers and
retailers as well as our consolidated bottling and distribution operations. Consumers enjoy finished
beverage products bearing trademarks owned by or licensed to the Company at a rate of 2.2 billion
servings each day. Our strong and stable bottling and distribution system helps us capture growth by
manufacturing, distributing and selling existing, enhanced and new innovative products to consumers
throughout the world.
The Coca-Cola system sold 32.7 billion and 31.3 billion unit cases of our products in 2022 and 2021,
respectively. Sparkling soft drinks represented 69 percent of our worldwide unit case volume in both
2022 and 2021. Trademark Coca-Cola accounted for 46 percent and 47 percent of our worldwide unit case
volume in 2022 and 2021, respectively. In 2022, unit case volume in the United States represented 17
percent of the Company’s worldwide unit case volume. Of the U.S. unit case volume, 61 percent was
attributable to sparkling soft drinks. Trademark Coca-Cola accounted for 42 percent of U.S. unit case
volume. Unit case volume outside the United States represented 83 percent of the Company’s worldwide
unit case volume in 2022. The countries outside the United States in which our unit case volumes were
the largest were Mexico, China, Brazil and India, which together accounted for 32 percent of our
worldwide unit case volume. Of the non-U.S. unit case volume, 70 percent was attributable to
sparkling soft drinks. Trademark Coca-Cola accounted for 47 percent of non-U.S. unit case volume.
Our five largest independent bottling partners based on unit case volume in 2022 were as follows:
• Coca-Cola FEMSA, S.A.B. de C.V. (“Coca-Cola FEMSA”), which has bottling and distribution operations
in Mexico (a substantial part of central Mexico, including Mexico City, as well as southeast and
northeast Mexico), Guatemala (most of the country), Colombia (most of the country), Nicaragua, Costa
Rica, Panama, Venezuela, Uruguay, Brazil (a major part of the states of São Paulo and Minas Gerais;
the states of Mato Grosso do Sul, Paraná and Santa Catarina; and part of the states of Rio Grande do
Sul, Goiás and Rio de Janeiro), and Argentina (federal capital of Buenos Aires and surrounding
areas);
• Coca-Cola Europacific Partners plc (“CCEP”), which has bottling and distribution operations in
Andorra, Australia, Belgium, Fiji, continental France, Germany, Great Britain, Iceland, Indonesia,
Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Papua New Guinea, Portugal, Samoa, Spain
and Sweden;
• Coca-Cola HBC AG (“Coca-Cola Hellenic”), which has bottling and distribution operations in Armenia,
Austria, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Egypt,
Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Montenegro, Nigeria, North Macedonia,
Northern Ireland, Poland, Republic of Ireland, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia,
Switzerland and Ukraine;
• Arca Continental, S.A.B. de C.V., which has bottling and distribution operations in northern and
western Mexico, northern Argentina, Ecuador, Peru, and the state of Texas and part of the states of
New Mexico, Oklahoma and Arkansas in the United States; and
• Swire Coca-Cola Limited, which as of December 31, 2022 had bottling and distribution operations in
11 provinces and the Shanghai municipality in mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Cambodia and
territories in 13 states in the western United States. Swire Coca-Cola Limited acquired our bottling
and distribution operations in Vietnam in January 2023.
In 2022, these five bottling partners combined represented 42 percent of our total worldwide unit
case volume.
Being a bottler does not create a legal partnership or joint venture between us and our bottlers. Our
bottlers are independent contractors and are not our agents.
 Bottler’s Agreements 
We have separate contracts, to which we generally refer as “bottler’s agreements,” with our bottling
partners under which our bottling partners are granted certain authorizations by us. Subject to
specified terms and conditions and certain variations, the bottler’s agreements generally authorize
the bottlers to prepare, package, distribute and sell Company Trademark Beverages in authorized
containers in (but, subject to applicable local law, generally only in) an identified territory. The
bottler is obligated to purchase its entire requirement of concentrates or syrups for the designated
Company Trademark Beverages from the Company or Company-authorized suppliers. We typically agree to
refrain from selling or distributing, or from authorizing third parties to sell or distribute, the
designated Company Trademark Beverages throughout the identified territory in the particular
authorized containers. However, we typically reserve for us or our designee the right (1) to prepare
and package such Company Trademark Beverages in such containers in the territory for sale outside the
territory; (2) to prepare, package, distribute and sell such Company Trademark Beverages in the
territory in any other manner or form (territorial restrictions on bottlers vary in some cases in
accordance with local law); and (3) to handle certain key accounts (accounts that cover multiple
territories).
 5 
While under most of our bottler’s agreements we generally have complete flexibility to determine the
price and other terms of sale of the concentrates and syrups we sell to our bottlers, as a practical
matter, our Company’s ability to exercise its contractual flexibility to determine the price and
other terms of sale of concentrates and syrups is subject, both outside and within the United States,
to competitive market conditions. However, in an effort to allow our Company and our bottling
partners to grow together through shared value, aligned financial objectives and the flexibility
necessary to meet consumers’ always changing needs and tastes, we have implemented an incidence-based
concentrate pricing model in most markets. Under this model, the concentrate price we charge is
impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, bottler pricing, the channels in
which the finished products produced from the concentrates are sold, and package mix.
As further discussed below, our bottler’s agreements for territories outside the United States differ
in some respects from our bottler’s agreements for territories within the United States.
Bottler’s Agreements Outside the United States
Bottler’s agreements between us and our authorized bottlers outside the United States generally are
of stated duration, subject in some cases to possible extensions or renewals. Generally, these
bottler’s agreements are subject to termination by the Company following the occurrence of certain
designated events, including defined events of default and certain changes in ownership or control of
the bottlers. Most of the bottler’s agreements in force between us and bottlers outside the United
States authorize the bottlers to manufacture and distribute fountain syrups, usually on a
nonexclusive basis.
In certain parts of the world outside the United States, we have not granted comprehensive beverage
production and distribution rights to the bottlers. In such instances, we have authorized certain
bottlers to (1) prepare and package Company Trademark Beverages for sale to other bottlers or (2)
purchase Company Trademark Beverages from other bottlers for sale and distribution throughout their
respective designated territories, often on a nonexclusive basis.
Bottler’s Agreements Within the United States
In the United States, most bottlers operate under a contract to which we generally refer as a
“Comprehensive Beverage Agreement” (“CBA”) that is of stated duration, subject in most cases to
renewal rights of bottlers and in some cases to renewal rights of the Company. A small number of
bottlers continue to operate under legacy bottler’s agreements with no stated expiration date for
Trademark Coca-Cola Beverages and other cola-flavored Company Trademark Beverages. In all instances,
the bottler’s agreements in the United States are subject to termination by the Company for
nonperformance or upon the occurrence of certain defined events of default that may vary from
contract to contract.
Certain U.S. bottlers have been granted certain additional exclusive territory rights for the
distribution, promotion, marketing and sale of Company-owned and licensed beverage brands (as defined
by the CBAs). We refer to these bottlers as “expanding participating bottlers” or “EPBs.” EPBs
operate under CBAs (“EPB CBAs”) under which the Company generally retained the rights to produce the
applicable beverage products for territories not covered by specific manufacturing agreements, and
such bottlers purchase from the Company (or from Company-authorized manufacturing bottlers)
substantially all of the finished beverage products needed in order to service the customers in these
territories. Each EPB CBA has a term of 10 years and is renewable, in most cases by the bottler, and
in some cases by the Company, indefinitely for successive additional terms of 10 years each and
includes additional requirements that provide for, among other things, a binding national governance
model, mandatory incidence pricing and certain core performance requirements. The Company has also
entered into manufacturing agreements that authorize certain EPBs that have executed EPB CBAs to
manufacture certain beverage products for their own account and for supply to other bottlers.
In addition, certain U.S. bottlers that were not granted additional exclusive territory rights, which
we refer to as “participating bottlers,” converted their legacy bottler’s agreements to CBAs, to
which we refer as “participating bottler CBAs,” each of which has a term of 10 years, is renewable by
the bottler indefinitely for successive additional terms of 10 years each, and is substantially
similar in most material respects to the EPB CBAs, including with respect to requirements for a
binding national governance model and mandatory incidence pricing, but includes core performance
requirements that vary in certain respects from those in the EPB CBAs.
Those bottlers that have not signed CBAs continue to operate under legacy bottler’s agreements that
include pricing formulas that generally provide for a baseline price for Trademark Coca-Cola
Beverages and other cola-flavored Company Trademark Beverages. This baseline price may be adjusted
periodically by the Company, up to a maximum indexed ceiling price, and is adjusted quarterly based
upon changes in certain sugar or sweetener prices, as applicable. The U.S. unit case volume prepared,
packaged, sold and distributed under these legacy bottler’s agreements is not material.
Under the terms of the bottler’s agreements, bottlers in the United States generally are not
authorized to manufacture fountain syrups. Rather, the Company manufactures and sells fountain syrups
to authorized fountain wholesalers (including certain authorized bottlers) and some fountain
retailers. These wholesalers in turn sell the syrups, or deliver them on our behalf, to restaurants
and other retailers.
 6 
 Promotional and Marketing Programs 
In addition to conducting our own independent advertising and marketing activities, we may provide
promotional and marketing support and/or funds to our bottlers. In most cases, we do this on a
discretionary basis under the terms of commitment letters or agreements, even though we are not
obligated to do so under the terms of the bottler’s agreements between our Company and the bottlers.
Also, on a discretionary basis in most cases, our Company may develop and introduce new products,
packages and equipment to assist the bottlers. Likewise, in many instances, we provide promotional
and marketing support and/or funds and/or dispensing equipment and repair services to fountain and
bottle/can retailers, typically pursuant to marketing agreements. The aggregate amount provided by
our Company to bottlers, resellers and other customers of our Company’s products, principally for
participation in promotional and marketing programs, was $4.8 billion in 2022.
 Investments in Bottling Operations 
Most of our branded beverage products are prepared, packaged, distributed and sold by independent
bottling partners. However, from time to time we acquire or take control of a bottling operation,
often in underperforming markets where we believe we can use our resources and expertise to improve
performance. Owning a bottling operation enables us to compensate for limited local resources; help
focus the bottler’s sales and marketing programs; assist in the development of the bottler’s business
and information systems; and establish an appropriate capital structure for the bottler. In line with
our long-term bottling strategy, we may periodically consider options for divesting or reducing our
ownership interest in a consolidated bottling operation, typically by selling all or a portion of our
interest in the bottling operation to an independent bottler to improve Coca-Cola system efficiency.
When we sell a consolidated bottling operation to an independent bottling partner in which we have an
equity method investment, our Company continues to participate in the bottler’s results of operations
through our share of the equity method investee’s earnings or losses.
In addition, from time to time we make equity investments representing noncontrolling interests in
certain bottling operations with the intention of maximizing the strength and efficiency of the Coca-
Cola system’s production, marketing, sales and distribution capabilities around the world by
providing expertise and resources to strengthen those businesses. These investments are intended to
result in increases in unit case volume, net operating revenues and profits at the bottler level,
which in turn generate increased sales for our Company’s concentrate operations. When our equity
investment provides us with the ability to exercise significant influence over the investee bottler’s
operating and financial policies, we account for the investment under the equity method.
 Seasonality 
Sales of our ready-to-drink beverages are somewhat seasonal, with the second and third calendar
quarters historically accounting for the highest sales volumes. The volume of sales in the beverage
business may be affected by weather conditions.
 Competition 
The commercial beverage industry is highly competitive and consists of numerous companies, ranging
from small or emerging to very large and well established. These include companies that, like our
Company, compete globally in multiple geographic areas, as well as businesses that are primarily
regional or local in operation. Competitive products include numerous nonalcoholic sparkling soft
drinks; water products, including flavored and enhanced waters; juices, juice drinks and nectars;
dilutables (including syrups and powders); coffees; teas; energy drinks; sports drinks; milk and
other dairy-based drinks; plant-based beverages; functional beverages, including vitamin-based
products and relaxation beverages; and various other nonalcoholic beverages. These competitive
products are sold to consumers in both ready-to-drink and non-ready-to-drink form. The Company has
directly entered the alcohol beverage category in numerous markets outside the United States. In the
United States, the Company has authorized alcohol-licensed third parties to use certain of our
trademarks and related intellectual property on alcohol beverages that contain Company beverage
bases. Competitive products include all flavored alcohol beverages containing various alcohol bases.
In many of the countries in which we do business, PepsiCo, Inc. is a primary competitor. Other
significant competitors include, but are not limited to, Nestlé S.A., Keurig Dr Pepper Inc., Danone
S.A., Suntory Beverage & Food Limited, Unilever, AB InBev, Kirin Holdings, Heineken N.V., Diageo and
Red Bull GmbH. We also compete against numerous regional and local companies and, increasingly,
against smaller companies that are developing microbrands and selling them directly to consumers
through e-commerce retailers and other e-commerce platforms. In addition, in some markets, we compete
against retailers that have developed their own store or private-label beverage brands.
Competitive factors impacting our business include, but are not limited to, pricing, advertising,
sales promotion programs, in-store displays and point-of-sale marketing, digital marketing, product
and ingredient innovation, increased efficiency in production techniques, the introduction of new
packaging as well as new vending and dispensing equipment, contracting with marketing assets
(theaters, sports arenas, universities, etc.), and brand and trademark development and protection.
Our competitive strengths include leading brands with high levels of consumer recognition and
loyalty; a worldwide network of bottlers and distributors of Company products; sophisticated
marketing capabilities; and a talented group of dedicated employees. Our competitive challenges
include strong competitors in all geographic regions; in many countries, a concentrated
 7 
retail sector with powerful buyers able to freely choose among Company products, products of
competitive beverage suppliers and individual retailers’ own store or private-label beverage brands;
new industry entrants; and dramatic shifts in consumer shopping methods and patterns due to a rapidly
evolving digital landscape.
 Raw Materials 
We and our bottling partners use various ingredients in our business, including high fructose corn
syrup (“HFCS”), sucrose, aspartame, acesulfame potassium, sucralose, saccharin, cyclamate, steviol
glycosides, ascorbic acid, citric acid, phosphoric acid, caffeine and caramel color; other raw
materials such as coffee, orange and other fruit juice and juice concentrates; packaging materials
such as polyethylene terephthalate (“PET”), bio-based PET and recycled PET for bottles; and aluminum
cans, glass bottles and other containers.
Water is a main ingredient in substantially all of our products. While historically we have not
experienced significant water supply difficulties, water is a limited natural resource in many parts
of the world, and our Company recognizes water availability, quality and sustainability, for both our
operations and also the communities where we operate, as one of the key challenges facing our
business.
In addition to water, the principal raw materials used in our business are nutritive and non-
nutritive sweeteners. In the United States, the principal nutritive sweetener is HFCS, which is
nutritionally equivalent to sugar. HFCS is available from numerous domestic sources and has
historically been subject to fluctuations in its market price. Adverse weather conditions may affect
the supply of agricultural commodities from which key ingredients for our products are derived. For
example, drought conditions in certain parts of the United States or in other major corn-producing
areas of the world may negatively affect the supply of corn, which in turn may result in shortages of
and higher prices for HFCS. The principal nutritive sweetener used by our business outside the United
States is sucrose (i.e., table sugar), which is also available from numerous sources and has
historically been subject to fluctuations in its market price. Our Company generally has not
experienced any difficulties in obtaining its requirements for nutritive sweeteners. In the United
States, we purchase HFCS to meet our and our bottlers’ requirements with the assistance of Coca-Cola
Bottlers’ Sales & Services Company LLC (“CCBSS”). CCBSS is a limited liability company that is owned
by authorized Coca-Cola bottlers doing business in the United States. Among other things, CCBSS
provides procurement services to our North American operations and to our U.S. bottling partners for
the purchase of various goods and services, including HFCS.
The principal non-nutritive sweeteners we use in our business are aspartame, acesulfame potassium,
sucralose, saccharin, cyclamate and steviol glycosides. Generally, these raw materials are readily
available from numerous sources. We purchase sucralose, which we consider a critical raw material,
from suppliers in the United States and China. Our Company generally has not experienced major
difficulties in obtaining its requirements for non-nutritive sweeteners.
Juice and juice concentrate from various fruits, particularly orange juice and orange juice
concentrate, are the principal raw materials for our juice and juice drink products. We source our
orange juice and orange juice concentrate primarily from Florida and the Southern Hemisphere
(particularly Brazil). We work closely with Cutrale Citrus Juices U.S.A., Inc., our primary supplier
of orange juice from Florida and Brazil, to ensure an adequate supply of orange juice and orange
juice concentrate that meets our Company’s standards. However, the citrus industry is impacted by
citrus greening disease and the variability of weather conditions that can affect the quality and
supply of orange juice and orange juice concentrate. In particular, freezing weather or hurricanes in
central Florida may result in shortages and higher prices for orange juice and orange juice
concentrate throughout the industry. In addition, citrus greening disease is reducing the number of
citrus trees and increasing grower costs and prices.
We generate most of our coffee revenues through Costa. Costa purchases Rainforest Alliance Certified
and other green coffee through multiple suppliers. While most of Costa’s coffee is sourced as readily
available bulked commercial grade from Brazil, Vietnam and Colombia, many of Costa’s suppliers have
vertically integrated supply chains with direct access to yields from cooperatives and producer
groups.
Our consolidated bottling operations and our non-bottling finished product operations also purchase
various other raw materials, including, but not limited to, PET resin, preforms and bottles; glass
and aluminum bottles; aluminum and steel cans; plastic closures; aseptic fiber packaging; labels;
cartons; cases; postmix packaging; and beverage gases, including carbon dioxide and liquid nitrogen.
While we generally purchase these raw materials from multiple suppliers and historically have not
experienced significant shortages, certain packaging materials, such as aluminum cans, are available
from a limited number of suppliers.
 Patents, Copyrights, Trade Secrets and Trademarks 
Our Company owns numerous patents, copyrights, trade secrets and other know-how and technology, which
we collectively refer to in this report as “technology.” This technology generally relates to
beverage products and the processes for their production; packages and packaging materials; design
and operation of processes and equipment useful for our business; and
 8 
certain software. Some of the technology is licensed to suppliers and other parties. Trade secrets
are an important aspect of our technology, and our sparkling beverage and other beverage formulas are
among the important trade secrets of our Company.
We also own numerous trademarks that are very important to our business. Depending upon the
jurisdiction, trademarks are valid as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly
maintained. Pursuant to our bottler’s agreements, we authorize our bottlers to use applicable Company
trademarks in connection with their preparation, packaging, distribution and sale of Company
products. In addition, we authorize certain third parties to use applicable Company trademarks in
connection with their preparation, packaging, distribution and sale of beverages bearing Company
trademarks in certain territories. We also grant licenses to third parties from time to time to use
certain of our trademarks in conjunction with certain merchandise and food products.
 Governmental Regulation 
Our Company is required to comply, and it is our policy to comply, with all applicable laws in the
countries and territories throughout the world in which we do business. In many jurisdictions, our
operations may come under special scrutiny by competition law authorities due to our competitive
position in those jurisdictions.
In the United States, the safety, production, transportation, distribution, advertising, labeling and
sale of our Company’s products and their ingredients are subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act; the Federal Trade Commission Act; the Lanham Act; state consumer protection laws;
various federal and state laws and regulations governing competition and trade practices, including
the Robinson-Patman Act of 1936, as amended, and the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914, as amended;
federal, state and local workplace health and safety laws; various federal, state and local
environmental protection laws; privacy and personal data protection laws; and various other federal,
state and local statutes and regulations. Outside the United States, our business is subject to
numerous similar statutes and regulations, as well as other legal and regulatory requirements and
regulatory reviews.
Under the Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 (“Proposition 65”) of the state of
California, if the state has determined that a substance causes cancer or harms human reproduction or
development, a warning must be provided for any product sold in the state that exposes consumers to
that substance, unless the conditions of an exemption (described below) can be met. The state
maintains lists of these substances and periodically adds other substances to these lists. The
detection of even a trace amount of a listed substance can subject an affected product to the
requirement of a warning label. However, Proposition 65 exempts a product from a warning if the
manufacturer can demonstrate that the use of that product exposes consumers to a daily quantity of a
listed substance that is:
• below a “safe harbor” threshold that may be established;
• naturally occurring;
• the result of necessary cooking; or
• subject to another applicable exemption.
One or more substances that are currently on the Proposition 65 list can be detected in certain
Company products at low levels that are safe. The Company maintains that the presence of each such
substance in Company products is subject to an applicable exemption from the warning requirement or
that the product is otherwise in compliance with Proposition 65. However, the state of California and
other parties have in the past taken a contrary position and may do so in the future. Additionally,
the state of California may include other substances on the Proposition 65 list in the future.
Bottlers of our beverage products presently offer, among other beverage containers, nonrefillable
recyclable containers in the United States and various other markets around the world. Some of these
bottlers also offer and use refillable containers, which are also recyclable. Legal requirements
apply in various jurisdictions in the United States and elsewhere around the world requiring that
deposits or certain ecotaxes or fees be charged in connection with the sale, marketing and use of
certain beverage containers. The precise requirements imposed by these measures vary. Other types of
statutes and regulations relating to beverage container deposits, recycling, ecotaxes, product
stewardship and/or restrictions or bans on the use of certain types of packaging, including certain
packaging containing per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (“PFAS”), also apply in various
jurisdictions in the United States and elsewhere around the world. We anticipate that additional such
legal requirements may be proposed or enacted in the future at federal, state and local levels, both
in the United States and elsewhere around the world.
All of our Company’s facilities and other operations in the United States and elsewhere around the
world are subject to various environmental protection statutes and regulations, including those
relating to the use of water resources, discharge of wastewater and air emissions. In addition,
increasing concern over climate change is expected to continue to result in additional legal or
regulatory requirements (both inside and outside the United States) designed to reduce or mitigate
the effects of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions on the environment, to discourage
the use of plastic materials, to limit or impose additional costs on commercial water use due to
local water scarcity concerns, or to expand disclosure of certain sustainability metrics. Our policy
is to comply with all such legal requirements. We have made, and plan on continuing to make,
expenditures
 9 
necessary to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations and to make progress toward
achieving our sustainability goals. While compliance has not had a material adverse effect on our
Company’s capital expenditures, net income or competitive position, changes in environmental
compliance requirements along with expenditures necessary to comply with such requirements and to
make progress toward achieving our sustainability goals could adversely affect our financial
performance.
We are also subject to various federal, state and international laws and regulations related to
cybersecurity, privacy and data protection, including the European Union’s General Data Protection
Regulation, China’s Personal Information Protection Law, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018,
which became effective on January 1, 2020, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act, which
became effective on January 1, 2023, the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, which became
effective on January 1, 2023, and privacy laws in Colorado, Connecticut and Utah, which are slated to
take effect during 2023. The interpretation and application of privacy, data protection and data
residency laws are often uncertain and are expanding in the United States and internationally,
including in the European Union, Brazil, China and other jurisdictions. We monitor pending and
proposed legislation and regulatory initiatives to ascertain their relevance to and potential impact
on our business, and we develop strategies to address regulatory trends and developments, including
any required changes to our privacy and data protection compliance programs and policies. Globally,
we see a trend toward data protection laws and regulations increasing in complexity and number, and
we anticipate that our obligations will expand commensurately. As a result, our ability to maximize
the utility of our data could be impacted and we may need to modify our practices to accommodate
legal and regulatory constraints and obligations or meet consumer expectations.
 Human Capital Management 
Our people and culture agendas are critical business priorities. Our Board of Directors, through the
Talent and Compensation Committee, provides oversight of the Company’s policies and strategies
relating to talent; leadership and culture, including diversity, equity and inclusion; and the
Company’s compensation philosophy and programs. The Talent and Compensation Committee also evaluates
and approves the Company’s compensation plans, policies and programs applicable to our senior
executives. In addition, the Committee on Directors and Corporate Governance of our Board of
Directors oversees succession planning and talent development for our senior executives.
 Employees 
We believe people are our most important asset, and we strive to attract and retain high-performing
talent. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, our Company had approximately 82,500 and 79,000 employees,
respectively, of which approximately 9,000 and 9,400, respectively, were located in the United
States. The increase in the total number of employees was primarily due to Costa opening new retail
stores as well as the existing Costa retail stores requiring additional staff to meet increased
demand, partially offset by the impact of refranchising our bottling operations in Cambodia. Our
Company, through its divisions and subsidiaries, is a party to numerous collective bargaining
agreements. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 600 employees in North America were covered by
collective bargaining agreements. These agreements typically have terms of three to five years. We
currently anticipate that we will be able to successfully renegotiate such agreements when they
expire.
 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
We believe that a diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace that mirrors the markets we serve is
critical to the Company’s continued growth and success. We take a comprehensive view of diversity,
equity and inclusion across different races, ethnicities, tribes, religions, socioeconomic
backgrounds, generations, abilities, and expressions of gender and sexual identity.
As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 7,800 employees located in the United States, excluding
the employees of the Global Ventures operating segment; fairlife, LLC; and BA Sports Nutrition, LLC.
Of these 7,800 employees, 40 percent and 48 percent were female and people of color, respectively.
We seek to create a better shared future for everyone our brands and business touch. We are focused
on providing access to equal opportunity and fostering belonging both in our workplaces and the local
communities we proudly serve. We have publicly announced our 2030 aspirations to be 50 percent led by
women globally, and in the United States, to reflect the U.S. Census racial and ethnic representation
at all job grade levels. Each of our operating units outside the United States has developed locally
relevant diversity, equity and inclusion aspirations. Diversity and inclusion metrics, which
highlight progress and help drive accountability, are shared with our senior leaders on a quarterly
basis. Our Global Women’s Leadership Council, composed of ten senior leaders, focuses on accelerating
the development and promotion of women into roles of increasing responsibility and influence.
We believe our sustainability goals, including our diversity, equity and inclusion aspirations, are
key drivers for growth. Accordingly, in 2022, we introduced quantitative and qualitative components
into our compensation programs for our executives to promote progress toward our diversity, equity
and inclusion aspirations, as well as to encourage the design and implementation of sustainable
diversity, equity and inclusion strategies and programs that foster the recruitment, development and
retention of diverse talent.
 10 
We conduct annual pay equity analyses, with regard to gender globally and race/ethnicity in the
United States, to help ensure our base pay structures are fair and to identify and address potential
issues or disparities. When appropriate, we adjust base pay. Also, as permitted by local law, during
the annual rewards cycle, we perform an adverse impact analysis on base pay, annual incentives and
long-term incentives to help ensure fairness.
We support many employee-led inclusion networks, which are an integral part of operationalizing and
embedding our diversity, equity and inclusion strategies. Our inclusion networks are regionally
structured to meet relevant local needs, and they provide employees with the opportunity to engage
with colleagues around the world based on common interests or backgrounds.
 Talent and Development 
Through our comprehensive global talent management processes, we continuously identify and develop
our talent for acceleration in our networked organization. We believe in providing challenging and
diverse experiences and opportunities to our people to help them develop and grow.
In 2022, we launched a global career strategy program called “Thrive,” which is designed to provide
clarity to employees on what it means to have a career at the Company. Through our people-centered
approach, we strive to create an integrated, streamlined and inspiring career experience. We believe
that development is anchored in acquiring skills and work experiences. We focus on investing in
inspirational leadership, capability development, and providing learning opportunities to equip our
global workforce with the skills they need for the future and to improve employee engagement and
retention. We provide a range of formal and informal learning programs, which are designed to help
our employees continuously grow and strengthen their skills throughout their careers. We provide
online learning through a robust catalog of digital content as well as experiential learning
opportunities, and we are continually identifying opportunities to provide democratized access to
content for all of our employees. We also have Thrive Opportunity Marketplace, a people-centered
technology solution that helps connect project opportunities to interested employees who have the
capacity, skills and interest in short-term experiences and assignments. Additionally, we offer
comprehensive Company-wide coaching and mentoring programs that support leadership and employee
development at all levels in our organization.
We also believe that talent thrives in a growth-oriented environment where high performance and
leadership effectiveness are valued. Our talent practices rely on data and feedback from multiple
sources to help our employees get the transparent and timely feedback they need to be successful.
 Compensation and Benefits 
Through comprehensive and competitive compensation and benefits, ongoing employee learning and
development, and a focus on health and well-being, we strive to support our employees in all aspects
of their lives. Our compensation programs are designed to reinforce our growth agenda and our talent
strategy as well as to drive a strong connection between the contributions of our employees and their
pay.
We believe the structure of our compensation packages provides the appropriate incentives to attract,
retain and motivate our employees. We provide base pay that is competitive and that aligns with
employee positions, skill levels, experience and geographic location. In addition to base pay, we
seek to reward employees with annual incentive awards, recognition programs, and equity awards for
employees at certain job levels.
We also offer competitive employee benefits packages, which vary by country and region. These
employee benefits packages may include: 401(k) plan, pension plan, core and supplemental life
insurance, financial courses and advisors, employee assistance programs, tuition assistance, commuter
assistance, adoption assistance, medical and dental insurance, vision insurance, health savings
accounts, health reimbursement and flexible spending accounts, well-being rewards programs, vacation
pay, holiday pay, and parental and adoption leave .
 Culture and Engagement 
As our employees work together to achieve our purpose to refresh the world and make a difference,
they collectively build and reinforce our culture. Our culture is rooted in our growth mindset, which
expects each employee, leader and function to be curious, empowered, inclusive and agile. We use a
variety of practices to measure and support progress against these growth behaviors and to ensure
that our employees are engaged and fulfilled at work. For example, our Performance Enablement and
Culture & Engagement Pulse platforms provide regular opportunities for employees across the
organization to provide feedback on how their leaders, teammates and work experiences support the
growth behaviors. Data from questionnaires are anonymized and plotted against historical results to
inform teams and functions on areas of strength and opportunities for improvement. We also encourage
regular, live communication across the organization and host quarterly global town halls with our
senior leadership that include employee question-and-answer sessions. In addition, function-level
town halls are held on a regular basis.

│ ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS │
In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the
following factors, which could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of
operations in future periods. The risks described below are not the only risks facing our Company.
Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may
materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations in future
periods.
 RISKS RELATED TO OUR OPERATIONS 
Unfavorable general economic and geopolitical conditions could negatively impact our financial
results.
Our business, operating results, financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected by
changes in global economic conditions, including inflation, credit market conditions, increased
unemployment, levels of consumer and business confidence, commodity (including energy) prices and
supply, a recession or economic slowdown, trade policies, foreign currency exchange rates, changing
policy positions or priorities, levels of government spending and deficits, and actual or anticipated
default on sovereign debt. Many of the jurisdictions in which our products are sold have experienced,
and could continue to experience, unfavorable changes in economic conditions, which could negatively
affect the affordability of, and consumer demand for, our beverages. Under difficult economic
conditions, consumers may seek to reduce discretionary spending by forgoing purchases of our products
or by shifting away from our beverages to lower-priced products offered by other companies, including
private-label brands, which could reduce our profitability and negatively affect our overall
financial performance.
Other financial uncertainties in our major markets and unstable geopolitical conditions or events in
certain markets, including civil unrest, acts of war, terrorism or governmental changes, or changes
in international relations could undermine global consumer confidence and reduce consumers’
purchasing power, thereby reducing demand for our products. Product boycotts resulting from political
activism could reduce demand for our products. Restrictions on our ability to transfer earnings or
capital across borders, price controls, limitations on profits, retaliatory tariffs, import
authorization requirements and other restrictions on business activities, which have been or may be
imposed or expanded as a result of political and economic instability, deterioration of economic
relations between countries or otherwise, could impact our profitability. In addition, U.S. trade
sanctions against countries designated by the U.S. government as state sponsors of terrorism and/or
financial institutions accepting transactions for commerce within such countries could increase
significantly, which could make it difficult, or even impossible, for us to continue to make sales to
bottlers in such countries. The imposition of retaliatory sanctions against U.S. multinational
corporations by countries that are or may become subject to U.S. trade sanctions, or the delisting of
our branded products by retailers in various countries in reaction to U.S. trade sanctions or other
governmental actions or policies, could also negatively affect our business.
In March 2022, the Company announced the suspension of its business in Russia. While we have
maintained our operations in Ukraine to the extent possible, our business in Ukraine has been
disrupted due to the conflict. Although we currently do not anticipate that the suspension of our
operations in Russia or the disruptions in Ukraine will have a material impact on our results of
operations, the conflict has resulted, and could continue to result, in volatile commodity markets,
supply chain disruptions, increased risk of cyber incidents or other disruptions to our information
systems, reputational risk, heightened risks to employee safety, business disruptions (including
labor shortages), reduced availability and increased costs for transportation, energy, packaging and
raw materials and other input costs, additional sanctions, export controls and other legislation or
regulations (including restrictions on the transfer of funds to and from Russia), or difficulty
protecting and enforcing our intellectual property rights. The ongoing conflict could result in the
temporary or permanent loss of assets or result in additional impairment charges. We cannot predict
how and the extent to which the conflict will continue to affect our employees, operations, customers
or business partners or our ability to achieve certain of our sustainability goals.
 12 
 Increased competition could hurt our business. 
We operate in the highly competitive commercial beverage industry. For additional information
regarding the competitive environment in which we operate, including the names of certain of our
significant competitors, refer to the heading “Competition” set forth in Part I, “Item 1. Business”
of this report. Our ability to maintain or gain share of sales in the global market or in regional or
local markets may be limited as a result of actions by competitors. Competitive pressures may cause
the Company and our bottling partners to reduce prices we charge customers or may restrict our and
our bottlers’ ability to increase prices, as may be necessary in response to commodity and other cost
increases. Such pressures may also increase marketing costs along with in-store placement, slotting
and other marketing fees. In addition, the rapid growth of e‑commerce may create additional consumer
price deflation by, among other things, facilitating comparison shopping, and could potentially
threaten the value of some of our legacy route-to-market strategies and thus negatively affect
revenues. If we do not continuously strengthen our capabilities in marketing and innovation to
maintain consumer interest, brand loyalty and market share while strategically expanding into other
profitable categories of the commercial beverage industry, our business could be negatively affected.
If we are not successful in our innovation activities, our financial results may be negatively
affected.
Achieving our business growth objectives depends in part on our ability to evolve and improve our
existing beverage products through innovation and to successfully develop, introduce and market new
beverage products. The success of our innovation activities depends on our ability to correctly
anticipate customer and consumer acceptance and trends; obtain, maintain and enforce necessary
intellectual property rights; and avoid infringing on the intellectual property rights of others. If
we are not successful in our innovation activities, we may not be able to achieve our growth
objectives, which may have a negative impact on our financial results.
Changes in the retail landscape or the loss of key retail or foodservice customers could adversely
affect our financial results.
Our industry is being affected by the trend toward consolidation in, and the blurring of the lines
between, retail channels, particularly in Europe and the United States. Retailers may seek lower
prices from us and our bottling partners, may demand increased marketing or promotional expenditures
in support of their businesses, and may be more likely to use their distribution networks to
introduce and develop private-label brands, any of which could negatively affect the Coca-Cola
system’s profitability. In addition, in developed markets, discounters and value stores are growing
at a rapid pace, while in emerging and developing markets, modern trade is growing at a faster pace
than traditional trade outlets. Our industry is also being affected by the rapid growth in sales
through e-commerce retailers, e-commerce websites, mobile commerce applications and subscription
services, which may result in a shift away from physical retail operations to digital channels. As we
and our bottling partners build e-commerce capabilities, we may not be able to develop and maintain
successful relationships with existing and new e-commerce retailers without experiencing a
deterioration of our relationships with key customers operating physical retail channels. If we are
unable to successfully adapt to the rapidly changing retail landscape, including the rapid growth in
digital commerce, our share of sales, volume growth and overall financial results could be negatively
affected. In addition, our success depends in part on our ability to maintain good relationships with
key retail and foodservice customers. The loss of one or more of our key retail or foodservice
customers could have an adverse effect on our financial performance.
If we are unable to expand our business in emerging and developing markets, our growth could be
negatively affected.
Our success depends in part on our ability to grow our business in emerging and developing markets,
which in turn depends on economic and political conditions in those markets and on our ability to
work with local bottlers to make necessary infrastructure enhancements to production facilities,
distribution networks, sales equipment and technology. Additionally, we rely on local availability of
talented management and employees to establish and manage our operations in these markets. Scarcity
of, or heavy competition for, talented employees could impede our abilities in such markets.
Moreover, the supply of our products in emerging and developing markets must match consumer demand
for those products. Due to product price, limited purchasing power and cultural differences, our
products may not be accepted in any particular emerging or developing market.
If we do not successfully manage the potential negative consequences of our productivity initiatives,
our business operations could be adversely affected.
We believe that improved productivity is essential to achieving our long-term growth objectives and,
therefore, a leading priority of our Company is to design and implement the most effective and
efficient business model possible. Consequently, we continuously search for productivity
opportunities in our business. Some of the actions we may take from time to time in pursuing these
opportunities may become a distraction for our managers and employees and may disrupt our ongoing
business operations; cause deterioration in employee morale, which may make it more difficult for us
to retain or attract qualified managers and employees; disrupt or weaken the internal control
structures of the affected business operations; and give rise to negative publicity, which could
affect our corporate reputation. If we are unable to successfully manage the potential negative
consequences of our productivity initiatives, our business operations could be adversely affected.
 13 
If we are unable to attract or retain a highly skilled and diverse workforce, our business could be
negatively affected.
The success of our business depends on our Company’s and the Coca-Cola system’s ability to attract,
hire, develop, motivate and retain a highly skilled and diverse workforce as well as on our success
in nurturing a culture that supports our growth and aligns employees around the Company’s purpose and
work that matters most. Competition for, along with compensation and benefits expectations of,
existing and prospective personnel have increased. In addition, the broader labor market is
experiencing a shortage of qualified workers, which has further increased the competition we face for
qualified employees. We may not be able to successfully compete for, attract or retain the highly
skilled and diverse workforce that we want and that our future business needs may require, such as
employees with e-commerce, social media and digital marketing and advertising skills, and/or digital
and analytics capabilities. Changes in immigration laws and policies could also make it more
difficult for us to recruit or relocate highly skilled technical, professional and management
personnel to meet our business needs. In addition, the unexpected loss of experienced and highly
skilled employees due to an increase in aggressive recruiting for best-in-class talent could deplete
our institutional knowledge base and erode our competitiveness. Failure to attract, hire, develop,
motivate and retain highly skilled and diverse talent; to meet our goals related to fostering an
inclusive and diverse culture, including increasing the number of underrepresented employees in the
United States; to develop and implement an adequate succession plan for our management team; to
maintain a corporate culture that fosters innovation, collaboration and inclusion; or to design and
successfully implement flexible work models that meet the expectations of employees and prospective
employees could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business and our future success.
Disruption of our supply chain, including increased commodity, raw material, packaging, energy,
transportation and other input costs may adversely affect our financial condition or results of
operations.
We have experienced, and could continue to experience, disruptions in our manufacturing operations
and supply chain. In connection with our manufacturing and bottling operations, we and our bottling
partners are dependent upon, among other things, various ingredients and other raw materials and
packaging materials. For additional information on the raw materials and supplies we use in our
business, refer to the heading “Raw Materials” set forth in Part I, “Item 1. Business” of this
report. Some of the raw materials and supplies used in the production of our products are available
from a limited number of suppliers or from a sole supplier or are in short supply when seasonal
demand is at its peak. Furthermore, some of our suppliers are located in countries experiencing
political or other risks and/or unfavorable economic conditions. We and our bottling partners may not
be able to maintain favorable arrangements and relationships with these suppliers, and our
contingency plans may not be effective in preventing disruptions that may arise from shortages of any
ingredients or other raw materials. In addition, adverse weather conditions may affect the supply of
agricultural commodities from which key ingredients for our products are derived. Any sustained or
significant disruption to the manufacturing or sourcing of products or materials could increase our
costs and interrupt product supply, which could adversely impact our business.
We and our independent bottlers operate a large fleet of trucks and other motor vehicles to
distribute beverage products to customers. In addition, we and our independent bottlers use a
significant amount of electricity, natural gas and other energy sources to operate production plants,
bottling plants and distribution facilities. Throughout 2022, increases in energy demand, along with
supply disruptions exacerbated by the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, resulted in significantly
higher energy prices, particularly in Europe, which could continue to impact us and our independent
bottlers in the future.
The raw materials and other supplies, including ingredients, agricultural commodities, energy, fuel,
packaging materials, transportation, labor and other supply chain inputs that we use for the
production and distribution of our products, are subject to price volatility and fluctuations in
availability caused by many factors. These factors include changes in supply and demand; supplier
capacity constraints; a deterioration of our or our bottling partners’ relationships with suppliers;
inflation; weather conditions (including the effects of climate change); wildfires and other natural
disasters; disease or pests (including the impact of citrus greening disease on the citrus industry);
agricultural uncertainty; health epidemics, pandemics or other contagious outbreaks (including
COVID-19); labor shortages, strikes or work stoppages; changes in or the enactment of new laws and
regulations; governmental actions or controls (including import/export restrictions, such as new or
increased tariffs, sanctions, quotas or trade barriers); port congestion or delays; transport
capacity constraints; cybersecurity incidents or other disruptions; political uncertainties; acts of
terrorism; governmental instability; or fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Many of our
raw materials and supplies are purchased in the open market and the prices we pay for such items are
subject to fluctuation. We expect the inflationary pressures on input and other costs to continue to
impact our business in 2023.
Our attempts to offset these cost pressures, such as through price increases of some of our products,
may not be successful. Higher product prices may result in reductions in sales volume. Consumers may
be less willing to pay a price differential for our branded products and may increasingly purchase
lower-priced offerings, or may forgo some purchases altogether. To the extent that price increases
are not sufficient to offset higher costs adequately or in a timely manner, and/or if they result in
significant decreases in sales volume, our financial condition or results of operations may be
adversely affected. Furthermore, we may not be able to offset cost increases through productivity
initiatives or through our commodity hedging activity.
 14 
The COVID-19 pandemic and related ongoing impacts may have a material adverse effect on our results
of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
Since early 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic and the related actions by governments around the world to
attempt to contain the spread of the virus have negatively impacted, and could continue to negatively
impact, our business globally. The extent and nature of governmental actions related to the COVID-19
pandemic have varied across our markets based upon the then-current extent and severity of the
COVID-19 pandemic. At times we have experienced a decrease in sales of certain of our products in
markets around the world, as well as a shift in consumer demand to more at-home consumption versus
away-from-home consumption. While we have experienced improved trends throughout 2021 and 2022 in
away-from-home channels and improved margins, our recovery has been asynchronous, and the full extent
to which the COVID-19 pandemic will affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash
flows will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain. If COVID-19 infection rates
increase, the pandemic intensifies, or continued efforts to curb the pandemic are ineffective, the
negative impacts of the pandemic on our sales could be more prolonged and may become more severe than
what we have experienced to date.
The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted and could continue to disrupt our global supply chain. We and our
bottling partners have experienced temporary disruptions in certain of our operations; delays in
delivery of concentrates, ingredients, packaging and equipment; temporary plant closures; production
slowdowns; and difficulty or delays in sourcing key ingredients and beverage containers. We and our
bottling partners may face similar disruptions in the future, which may increase supply chain and
packaging costs, or may result in an inability to secure key ingredients and inputs, which could
cause delays in delivering our products to our customers and consumers. Although we are unable to
predict the impact on our ability to source materials in the future, we expect supply chain pressures
to continue into 2023.
In addition to the above risks, the COVID-19 pandemic may exacerbate other risks related to our
business, including risks related to changes in the retail landscape or the loss of key retail or
foodservice customers; fluctuations in input costs, inflation rates, and foreign currency exchange
rates; and the ability of third-party service providers and business partners to fulfill their
respective commitments and responsibilities to us in a timely manner and in accordance with the
agreed-upon terms. The continuing evolution of the pandemic may also present risks not currently
known to us.
If we do not successfully integrate and manage our acquired businesses, brands or bottling
operations, or if we are unable to realize a significant portion of the anticipated benefits of our
joint ventures or strategic relationships, our financial results could suffer.
We routinely evaluate opportunities to acquire businesses or brands to expand our beverage portfolio
and capabilities. Additionally, from time to time, we have acquired or taken control of bottling
operations, often in underperforming markets where we believe we can use our resources and expertise
to improve performance. We may incur unforeseen liabilities and obligations in connection with
acquiring businesses, brands or bottling operations. The expected benefits of business or brand
acquisitions, including cost and growth synergies associated with such acquisitions, may take longer
to realize than expected or may not be realized at all. Moreover, we may encounter challenges to
successfully integrating the operations, technologies, services, products and systems of any acquired
businesses in an effective, timely and cost-efficient manner. We may also encounter unexpected
difficulties, costs or delays in restructuring and integrating acquired businesses, brands or
bottling operations into our Company’s operating, governance, sustainability and internal control
structures, including extending our Company’s internal control over financial reporting to newly
acquired businesses, which may increase the risk of failure to prevent misstatements in their
financial records and in our consolidated financial statements. In addition, our quality management
program, which is designed to ensure product quality and safety, may not be sufficiently robust to
effectively manage the expanded range of product offerings introduced through newly acquired
businesses or brands, which may increase our costs or subject us to negative publicity. Also, we may
not be able to successfully manage the additional complexities involved with overseeing various
supply chain models as we expand our product offerings. Our financial performance is impacted by how
well we can integrate and manage acquired businesses, brands and bottling operations, and we may not
be able to achieve our strategic and financial objectives for acquired businesses, brands or bottling
operations. If we incur unforeseen liabilities or costs in connection with acquiring or integrating
businesses, brands or bottling operations, experience internal control or product quality failures,
or are unable to achieve our strategic and financial objectives for acquired businesses, brands or
bottling operations, our consolidated results could be negatively affected.
We also participate in the sales of other beverage brands through licenses, joint ventures and
strategic relationships. If we are unable to successfully manage our relationships with our joint
venture partners or our strategic relationships, including our relationship with Monster, or if for
any other reason we fail to realize all or a significant portion of the benefits we expect from our
joint ventures or strategic relationships, our financial performance could be adversely affected.
 15 
If our third-party service providers and business partners do not satisfactorily fulfill their
commitments and responsibilities, our financial results could suffer.
In the conduct of our business, we rely on relationships with third parties, including cloud data
storage and other information technology service providers, suppliers, distributors, contractors,
joint venture partners and other external business partners, for certain services in support of key
portions of our operations. These third parties are subject to similar risks as we are relating to
cybersecurity, privacy violations, business interruption, and systems and employee failures, and are
subject to legal, regulatory and market risks of their own. Our third-party service providers and
business partners may not fulfill their respective commitments and responsibilities in a timely
manner and in accordance with the agreed-upon terms or applicable laws. In addition, while we have
procedures in place for assessing risk along with selecting, managing and monitoring our
relationships with third-party service providers and other business partners, we do not have control
over their business operations or governance and compliance systems, practices and procedures, which
increases our financial, legal, reputational and operational risk. If we are unable to effectively
manage our third-party relationships, or for any reason our third-party service providers or business
partners fail to satisfactorily fulfill their commitments and responsibilities, our financial results
could suffer.
If we are unable to renew collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms, or if we or our
bottling partners experience strikes, work stoppages or labor unrest, our business could suffer.
Many of our employees at our key manufacturing locations and bottling plants are covered by
collective bargaining agreements. While we generally have been able to renegotiate collective
bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms when they expire and regard our relations with employees
and their representatives as generally satisfactory, negotiations may nevertheless be challenging, as
the Company must have competitive cost structures in each market while meeting the compensation and
benefits needs of our employees. If we are unable to renew collective bargaining agreements on
satisfactory terms, our labor costs could increase, which could affect our profit margins. In
addition, many of our bottling partners’ employees are represented by labor unions. Strikes, work
stoppages or other forms of labor unrest at any of our major manufacturing facilities or at our
bottling operations or our major bottlers’ plants could impair our ability to supply concentrates and
syrups to our bottling partners or our bottlers’ ability to supply finished beverages to customers,
which could reduce our net operating revenues and could expose us to customer claims. Furthermore,
from time to time we and our bottling partners restructure manufacturing and other operations to
improve productivity, which may have negative impacts on employee morale and work performance, result
in escalation of grievances and adversely affect the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements.
If these labor relations are not effectively managed at the local level, they could escalate in the
form of corporate campaigns supported by the labor organizations and could negatively affect our
Company’s overall reputation and brand image, which in turn could have a negative impact on our
products’ acceptance by consumers.
 RISKS RELATED TO CONSUMER DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS 
Obesity and other health-related concerns may reduce demand for some of our products.
There is growing concern among consumers, public health professionals and government agencies about
the health problems associated with obesity. Increasing public concern about obesity; other health-
related public concerns surrounding consumption of sweetened beverages; potential new or increased
taxes on sweetened beverages by government entities to reduce consumption or to raise revenue;
additional governmental regulations concerning the advertising, marketing, labeling, packaging or
sale of our sweetened beverages; and negative publicity resulting from actual or threatened legal
actions against us or other companies in our industry relating to the marketing, labeling or sale of
sweetened beverages may reduce demand for, or increase the cost of, our sweetened beverages, which
could adversely affect our profitability.
If we do not address evolving consumer product and shopping preferences, our business could suffer.
Consumer product preferences have evolved and continue to evolve as a result of, among other things,
health, wellness and nutrition considerations, including concerns regarding caloric intake associated
with sweetened beverages and the perceived undesirability of artificial ingredients; concerns
regarding the perceived health effects of, or location of origin of, ingredients, raw materials or
substances in our products or packaging, including due to the results of third-party studies (whether
or not scientifically valid); shifting consumer demographics; changes in consumer tastes and needs
coupled with a rapid expansion of beverage options and delivery methods; changes in consumer
lifestyles; concerns regarding the environmental, social and sustainability impact of ingredient
sources and the product manufacturing process; consumer emphasis on transparency related to
ingredients we use in our products and collection and recyclability of, and amount of recycled
content contained in, our packaging containers and other materials; concerns about the health and
welfare of animals in our dairy supply chain; and competitive product and pricing pressures. In
addition, in many of our markets, shopping patterns are being affected by the digital evolution, with
consumers rapidly embracing shopping by way of mobile device applications, e-commerce retailers and
e-commerce websites or platforms. If we fail to address changes in consumer product and shopping
preferences, do not successfully anticipate and prepare for future changes in such preferences, or
are ineffective or slow in developing and implementing appropriate digital transformation
initiatives, our share of sales, revenue growth and overall financial results could be negatively
affected.
 16 
Product safety and quality concerns could negatively affect our business.
Our success depends in large part on our ability to maintain consumer confidence in the safety and
quality of all of our products. We have rigorous product safety and quality standards, which we
expect our operations as well as our bottling partners to meet. However, despite our strong
commitment to product safety and quality, we or our bottling partners periodically have not met, and
may not always meet, these standards, particularly as we expand our product offerings through
innovation or acquisitions into beverage categories, such as value-added dairy and plant-based
beverages, that are beyond our traditional range of beverage products. If we or our bottling partners
fail to comply with applicable product safety and quality standards, or if our beverage products
taken to the market are or become contaminated or adulterated by any means, we may be required to
conduct costly product recalls and may become subject to product liability claims and negative
publicity, which could cause our business to suffer.
Public debate and concern about perceived negative health consequences of certain ingredients, such
as non-nutritive sweeteners and biotechnology-derived substances, and of other substances present in
our beverage products or packaging materials, may reduce demand for our beverage products.
Public debate and concern about perceived negative health consequences of certain ingredients in our
beverage products, such as synthetic colors, non-nutritive sweeteners and biotechnology-derived
substances; substances that are present in our beverage products naturally or that occur as a result
of the manufacturing process, such as 4-methylimidazole (“4-MEI”), a chemical compound that is formed
during the manufacturing of certain types of caramel coloring used in cola-flavored beverages; or
substances used in packaging materials, such as bisphenol A (“BPA”), an odorless, tasteless food-
grade chemical commonly used in the food and beverage industries as a component in the coating of the
interior of cans, may affect consumers’ preferences and cause them to shift away from some of our
beverage products. In addition, increasing public concern about perceived or potential health
consequences of the presence of ingredients or substances in our beverage products or in packaging
materials (or alleged presence of substances such as PFAS) and/or the results of third-party studies
(whether or not scientifically valid) purporting to assess the health implications of consumption of
certain ingredients or substances present in certain of our products or packaging materials have
resulted, and could result, in additional governmental regulations concerning the advertising,
marketing, labeling, packaging or sale of our beverages; potential new or increased taxes on our
beverages by government entities; and negative publicity, or actual or threatened legal actions
against us or other companies in our industry, all of which could damage the reputation of, and may
reduce demand for, our beverage products.
If we are not successful in our efforts to digitalize the Coca-Cola system, our financial results
could be negatively affected.
The digital evolution is affecting how we interact with consumers, customers, suppliers, bottlers and
other business partners and stakeholders. We believe our future success will depend in part on our
ability to adapt to and thrive in the digital environment. Therefore, one of our top priorities is to
digitalize the Coca-Cola system by, among other things, creating more relevant and more personalized
experiences wherever our system interacts with consumers, whether in a digital environment or through
digital devices in an otherwise physical environment; finding ways to create more powerful digital
tools and capabilities for the Coca-Cola system’s retail customers to enable them to grow their
businesses; and digitalizing operations through the use of data, artificial intelligence, automation,
robotics and digital devices to increase efficiency and productivity. If we are not successful in our
efforts to digitalize the Coca-Cola system, our ability to increase sales and improve margins may be
negatively affected and the cost and expenses we have incurred or may incur in connection with our
digitalization initiatives may adversely impact our financial performance.
If negative publicity, whether or not warranted, concerning product safety or quality, workplace and
human rights, obesity or other issues damages our brand image, corporate reputation and social
license to operate, our business may suffer.
Our success depends in large part on our ability to maintain the brand image of our existing
products, build the brand image for new products and brand extensions, and maintain our corporate
reputation and social license to operate. However, our continuing investment in advertising and
marketing and our strong commitment to product safety and quality and human rights have not always
had, and may not in the future always have, the desired impact on our products’ brand image and on
consumer preferences. Product safety or quality issues, actual or perceived, or allegations of
product contamination, even when false or unfounded, could tarnish the image of the affected brands
and may cause consumers to choose other products. In some emerging markets, the production and sale
of counterfeit or “spurious” products, which we and our bottling partners may not be able to fully
combat, may damage the image and reputation of our products. In addition, from time to time, we and
our executives have engaged, and may in the future engage, in public policy endeavors that are either
directly related to our products and packaging or to our business operations and the general economic
climate affecting the Company. These engagements in public policy debates have been, and could in the
future be, the subject of backlash from advocacy groups or others that have a differing point of view
and could result in adverse media and consumer reaction, including product boycotts. Similarly, our
sponsorship relationships have subjected us in the past, and could subject us in the future, to
negative publicity as a result of actual or alleged misconduct by individuals, hosts or entities
associated with organizations we sponsor or support financially or through in-kind contributions.
Likewise, campaigns by activists connecting us, or our bottling system or supply
 17 
chain, with workplace, human rights or animal welfare issues, whether actual or perceived, could
adversely impact our corporate image and reputation. Additionally, negative postings or comments on
social media or networking websites about the Company or one of its brands, even if inaccurate or
malicious, have in the past, and could in the future, generate adverse publicity that could damage
the reputation of our brands or the Company. Furthermore, allegations, even if untrue, that we are
not respecting internationally recognized human rights; actual or perceived failure by our suppliers
or other business partners to comply with applicable workplace and labor laws, including child labor
laws, or their actual or perceived abuse or misuse of migrant workers; actual or perceived failure by
our suppliers, joint venture partners or other business partners to engage in proper animal welfare
practices; and adverse publicity surrounding obesity and health concerns related to our products,
water usage, environmental impact, labor relations or the like could negatively affect our Company’s
overall reputation and brand image, which in turn could have a negative impact on our products’
acceptance by consumers. In addition, if we fail to respect our employees’ and our supply chain
employees’ human rights, or inadvertently discriminate against any group of employees or hiring
prospects, our ability to hire and retain the best talent will be diminished, which could have an
adverse impact on our overall business.
If we are unable to successfully manage new product launches, our business and financial results
could be adversely affected.
Due to the highly competitive nature of the commercial beverage industry, the Company continually
introduces new products and evolves existing products to stimulate consumer demand. For instance, the
Company has directly entered the alcohol beverage category in numerous markets outside the United
States, and in the United States, the Company has authorized alcohol-licensed third parties to use
certain of our trademarks and related intellectual property on alcohol beverages that contain Company
beverage bases. The success of new and evolved products depends on a number of factors, including
timely and successful product development, adherence to new global and/or local standards of
practice, consumer acceptance and stakeholder perception. Such endeavors may also involve significant
risks and uncertainties, including greater execution risks; higher costs; lower rates of sales;
distraction of management from existing operations; lower product, category or industry knowledge and
expertise; slower than expected or inadequate return on investments; increased competitive pressures;
stakeholder scrutiny; and reliance on the performance of third parties. As we become subject to
additional governmental regulations, including alcohol regulations related to licensing, trade and
pricing practices, labeling, advertising, promotion and marketing practices, and relationships with
distributors, we may become exposed to the risk of increased compliance costs and disruptions to our
existing business.
 RISKS RELATED TO THE COCA-COLA SYSTEM 
We rely on our bottling partners for a significant portion of our business. If we are unable to
maintain good relationships with our bottling partners, our business could suffer.
We generate a significant portion of our net operating revenues by selling concentrates and syrups to
independent bottling partners. As independent companies, our bottling partners, some of which are
publicly traded companies, make their own business decisions that may not always align with our
interests. In addition, some of our bottling partners have the right to manufacture or distribute
their own products or certain products of other beverage companies. If we are unable to maintain
operating and strategic alignment or agree on appropriate pricing and marketing and advertising
support, or if our bottling partners are not satisfied with our brand innovation and development
efforts, they may take actions that, while maximizing their own short-term profits, may be
detrimental to our Company or our brands, or they may devote more of their resources to business
opportunities or products other than those of the Company. Such actions could, in the long term, have
an adverse effect on our profitability.
If our bottling partners’ financial condition deteriorates, our business and financial results could
be affected.
In the vast majority of our markets, our products are sold and distributed by independent bottling
partners, and we therefore derive a significant portion of our net operating revenues from sales of
concentrates and syrups to independent bottling partners. Accordingly, the success of our business
depends in part on our bottling partners’ financial strength and profitability. While under our
agreements with our bottling partners we generally have the right to unilaterally change the prices
we charge for our concentrates and syrups, our ability to do so may be materially limited by our
bottling partners’ financial condition and their ability to pass price increases along to their
customers. In addition, we have investments in certain of our bottling partners, which we account for
under the equity method, and our operating results include our proportionate share of such bottling
partners’ income or loss. Our bottling partners’ financial condition is affected in large part by
conditions and events that are beyond our and their control, including competitive and general market
conditions; the availability of capital and other financing resources on reasonable terms; loss of
major customers; changes in or additional regulations; or disruptions of bottling operations that may
be caused by strikes, work stoppages, labor unrest, natural disasters or other catastrophic events. A
deterioration of the financial condition or results of operations of one or more of our major
bottling partners could adversely affect our net operating revenues from sales of concentrates and
syrups; and, if such deterioration involves one or more of our
 18 
equity method investee bottling partners, it could also result in a decrease in our equity income
and/or impairments of our equity method investments.
We may from time to time engage in refranchising activities or divestitures of certain brands or
businesses, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
As part of our strategic initiative to focus on our core business of building brands and leading our
system of bottling partners, we continue to seek opportunities to refranchise our consolidated
bottling operations. Our refranchising activities require significant attention and effort on the
part of, and therefore may be a distraction for, senior management. If we are unable to complete
future refranchising transactions on terms and conditions favorable to us, or if our refranchising
partners are not efficient or not aligned with our long-term vision for the Coca-Cola system, our
business and results of operations could be adversely affected. Additionally, we have divested and
may in the future divest certain brands or businesses. These divestitures may adversely impact our
business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition if we are unable to offset
impacts from the loss of revenue associated with the divested brands or businesses, or if we are
otherwise unable to achieve the anticipated benefits or cost savings from such divestitures.
 RISKS RELATED TO REGULATORY AND LEGAL MATTERS 
Increases in income tax rates, changes in income tax laws or regulations, or unfavorable resolutions
of tax matters could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.
We are subject to income tax in the United States and numerous other jurisdictions in which we
generate profits. Our overall effective income tax rate is a function of applicable local tax rates
in the jurisdictions in which we operate, tax treaties between such jurisdictions, and the geographic
mix of our income before income taxes, which is itself impacted by currency movements. Consequently,
the isolated or combined effects of unfavorable movements in tax rates, geographic mix or foreign
currency exchange rates could reduce our net income. Tax laws and regulations, including rates of
taxation, are subject to revisions by individual taxing jurisdictions, and such revisions may result
from multilateral agreements. Many jurisdictions have enacted legislation and adopted policies
resulting from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (“OECD”) anti-Base
Erosion and Profit Shifting project. The OECD is currently coordinating a project on behalf of the
G20 and other participating countries which would grant additional taxing rights over profits earned
by multinational enterprises to the countries in which their products are sold and services rendered.
Model rules adopted pursuant to this project would establish a global per-country minimum tax of 15
percent, and the European Union has approved a directive requiring member states to incorporate
similar provisions into their respective domestic laws. The directive requires the rules to initially
become effective for fiscal years starting on or after December 31, 2023. Other countries have taken
similar actions. It is possible that the legislative adoption of these or other proposals could have
a material impact on our net income and cash flows. Significant judgment is required in determining
our annual income tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions. Although we believe our tax
estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related disputes could be
materially different from our historical income tax provisions, estimates and accruals. The results
of audits or related disputes could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements for
the period or periods for which the applicable final determinations are made and for periods for
which the statute of limitations is open.
For instance, the United States Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) is seeking to increase our U.S.
taxable income for tax years 2007 through 2009 by an amount that creates a potential additional U.S.
federal income tax liability of approximately $3.3 billion for that period, plus interest. The
Company firmly believes that the IRS’ claims are without merit and is pursuing, and will continue to
pursue, all available administrative and judicial remedies necessary to vigorously defend its
position. On November 18, 2020, the U.S. Tax Court (“Tax Court”) issued an opinion (“Opinion”)
predominantly siding with the IRS. Although the Company disagrees with the unfavorable portions of
the Opinion and intends to vigorously defend its position, considering all avenues of appeal, there
is no assurance that the courts will ultimately rule in the Company’s favor. It is therefore possible
that all or some of the unfavorable portions of the Opinion could ultimately be upheld. In that
event, the Company would be subject to significant additional liabilities for the years at issue and
potentially also for the subsequent years if the unfavorable portions of the Opinion were to be
applied to the foreign licensees covered within the scope of the Opinion. Moreover, the IRS could
successfully appeal the portions of the Opinion that are favorable to the Company and/or assert new
claims for additional tax relating to the subsequent years by broadening the scope to cover
additional foreign licensees. These adjustments could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s
financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Any such adjustments related to years prior
to 2018, either in the litigation period or thereafter, may also have an impact on the transition tax
payable as part of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Reform Act”). For additional information
regarding the tax litigation, refer to Part I, “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” of this report.
Increased or new indirect taxes could negatively affect our business.
Our business operations are subject to numerous duties or taxes that are not based on income,
sometimes referred to as “indirect taxes,” including import duties, tariffs, excise taxes, sales or
value-added taxes, taxes on sweetened beverages, packaging taxes, carbon taxes, property taxes and
payroll taxes, in many of the jurisdictions in which we operate. In addition, in the past, the
 19 
U.S. Congress considered imposing a federal excise tax on beverages sweetened with sugar, HFCS or
other nutritive sweeteners and may consider similar proposals in the future. As federal, state and
local governments in the United States and throughout the world experience significant budget
deficits, some lawmakers have singled out beverages among a plethora of revenue-raising items and
have imposed or increased, or proposed to impose or increase, sales or similar taxes on beverages,
particularly sweetened beverages and alcohol beverages, as well as packaging and/or packaging
materials. Increases in or the imposition of new indirect taxes on our business operations or
products would increase the cost of products or, to the extent levied directly on consumers, make our
products less affordable, which may negatively impact our net operating revenues and profitability.
Changes in laws and regulations relating to beverage containers and packaging could increase our
costs and reduce demand for our products.
We and our bottlers offer, among other beverage containers, nonrefillable containers in the United
States and in various other markets around the world. Legal requirements have been enacted in various
jurisdictions requiring that deposits or certain ecotaxes or fees be charged in connection with the
sale, marketing and use of certain beverage containers. Other proposals relating to beverage
container deposits, recycling, recycling content, tethered bottle caps, ecotax and/or product
stewardship, or prohibitions on certain types of plastic products, packages and cups (including
packaging containing PFAS) have been introduced and/or adopted in various jurisdictions, and we
anticipate that similar legislation or regulations may be proposed in the future at federal, state
and local levels, both in the United States and elsewhere. Consumers’ increased concerns and changing
attitudes about solid waste streams and environmental responsibility and the related publicity could
result in the adoption of additional such legislation or regulations in the future. If these types of
requirements are adopted and implemented on a large scale, they could affect our costs or require
changes in our distribution model, which could reduce our net operating revenues and profitability.
Significant additional labeling or warning requirements or limitations on the marketing or sale of
our products may inhibit sales of affected products.
Various jurisdictions have adopted and may seek to adopt significant additional product labeling or
warning requirements or limitations on the marketing or sale of our products because of what they
contain or allegations that they cause adverse health effects. If these types of requirements become
applicable to one or more of our products under current or future environmental or health laws or
regulations, they may inhibit sales of such products.
For example, under one such law in California, known as Proposition 65, if the state has determined
that a substance causes cancer or harms human reproduction or development, a warning must be provided
for any product sold in the state that exposes consumers to that substance, unless the exposure falls
under an established safe harbor level or another exemption is applicable. For additional information
regarding Proposition 65, refer to the heading “Governmental Regulation” set forth in Part I, “Item
1. Business” of this report. If we were required to add Proposition 65 warnings on the labels of one
or more of our beverage products produced for sale in California, the resulting consumer reaction to
the warnings and potential adverse publicity could negatively affect our sales both in California and
in other markets.
Litigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and damage our reputation.
We are party to various litigation claims and legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business,
including, but not limited to, those arising out of our advertising and marketing practices, product
claims and labels, competition, distribution and pricing, intellectual property and commercial
disputes, tax disputes, and environmental and employment matters. We evaluate these litigation claims
and legal proceedings to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and to estimate, if possible,
the amount of potential losses. Based on these assessments and estimates, we establish reserves
and/or disclose the relevant litigation claims or legal proceedings, as appropriate. These
assessments and estimates are based on the information available to management at the time and
involve a significant amount of management judgment. Actual outcomes or losses may differ materially
from our current assessments and estimates.
We conduct business in markets with high-risk legal compliance environments, which exposes us to
increased legal and reputational risk.
We have bottling and other business operations in markets with high-risk legal compliance
environments. Our policies and procedures require strict compliance by our employees and agents with
all United States and local laws and regulations and consent orders applicable to our business
operations, including those prohibiting improper payments to government officials. Nonetheless, our
policies, procedures and related training programs may not always ensure full compliance by our
employees and agents with all applicable legal requirements. Improper conduct by our employees or
agents could damage our reputation in the United States and internationally or lead to litigation or
legal proceedings that could result in civil or criminal penalties, including substantial monetary
fines as well as disgorgement of profits.
 20 
Failure to adequately protect, or disputes relating to, trademarks, formulas and other intellectual
property rights could harm our business.
Our trademarks, formulas and other intellectual property rights (refer to the heading “Patents,
Copyrights, Trade Secrets and Trademarks” in Part I, “Item 1. Business” of this report) are essential
to the success of our business. We cannot be certain that the legal steps we are taking around the
world are sufficient to protect our intellectual property rights or that, notwithstanding legal
protection, others do not or will not infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property rights. If
we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, or if changes in laws diminish or
remove the current legal protections available to them, the competitiveness of our products may be
eroded and our business could suffer. In addition, we could come into conflict with third parties
over intellectual property rights, which could result in disruptive and expensive litigation. Any of
the foregoing could harm our business.
Changes in, or failure to comply with, the laws and regulations applicable to our products or our
business operations could increase our costs or reduce our net operating revenues.
Our Company is subject to various laws and regulations in the countries and territories throughout
the world in which we do business, including laws and regulations relating to competition,
distribution and pricing, product safety, advertising and labeling, container deposits, recycling,
recycled content, product stewardship, the protection of the environment, occupational health and
safety, employment and labor practices, personal data protection and privacy, and data security. For
additional information regarding laws and regulations applicable to our business, refer to the
heading “Governmental Regulation” set forth in Part I, “Item 1. Business” of this report. Changes in
applicable laws or regulations or evolving interpretations thereof, changes in enforcement priorities
of regulators, and differing or competing regulations and standards across the markets where our
products or raw materials are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, have in the past resulted in,
and could continue to result in, higher compliance costs, higher capital expenditures and higher
production costs, or make it necessary for us to reformulate certain of our products, resulting in
adverse effects on our business. In addition, increased or additional regulations to limit and/or
report carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions as a result of concern over climate change;
to discourage the use of plastic materials, including regulations relating to recovery and/or
disposal of plastic bottles and other packaging materials due to environmental concerns; or to limit
or impose additional costs on commercial water use due to local water scarcity concerns, have in the
past and could continue to result in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures and other
financial obligations for us and our bottling partners, which could affect our profitability, or may
impede the production, distribution, marketing and sale of our products, which could affect our net
operating revenues. Failure to comply with various laws and regulations (or allegations thereof),
such as U.S. trade sanctions, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the Office of Foreign Assets
Control trade sanction regulations and anti-boycott regulations; antitrust and competition laws;
anti-modern slavery laws; anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws; data privacy laws, including the
European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation and China’s Personal Information Protection Law;
tax laws and regulations; and a variety of other applicable local, national and multinational
regulations and laws, could result in litigation or criminal or civil enforcement actions, including
voluntary and involuntary document requests, the assessment of damages, the imposition of penalties,
the suspension of production or distribution, costly changes to equipment or processes due to
required corrective action, or the cessation or interruption of operations at our or our bottling
partners’ facilities, as well as damage to our or our bottling partners’ image and reputation, all of
which could harm our or our bottling partners’ profitability.
 RISKS RELATED TO FINANCE, ACCOUNTING AND INVESTMENTS 
Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial
results.
We earn revenues, pay expenses, own assets and incur liabilities in countries using many currencies
other than the U.S. dollar. In 2022, we derived $27.6 billion of net operating revenues from
operations outside the United States. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in
U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues, income and expenses, as well as assets and liabilities,
into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period.
Therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies affect our
net operating revenues, operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign
currencies. Global events, including the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, trade disputes,
economic sanctions, inflation, increasing interest rates and emerging market volatility, and the
resulting uncertainties, may cause currencies to fluctuate in relation to the U.S. dollar. Due to the
geographic diversity of our operations, weakness in some currencies may be offset by strength in
other currencies over time. We also use derivative financial instruments to further reduce our net
exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. However, fluctuations in foreign currency
exchange rates, particularly the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against major currencies or the
currencies of large developing countries, could materially affect our financial results.
If interest rates increase, our net income could be negatively affected.
We maintain levels of debt that we consider prudent based on our cash flows, interest coverage ratio
and percentage of debt to capital. We use debt financing to lower our cost of capital, which
increases our return on shareowners’ equity. This exposes us to adverse changes in interest rates.
When and to the extent appropriate, we use derivative financial instruments to reduce our
 21 
exposure to interest rate risks. However, our financial risk management program may not be successful
in reducing the risks inherent in exposures to interest rate fluctuations. On December 31, 2021, the
United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority, the governing body responsible for regulating the
London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), ceased to publish certain LIBOR reference rates. However,
other LIBOR reference rates, including U.S. dollar overnight, 1-month, 3-month, 6-month and 12-month
maturities, will continue to be published through June 2023. In preparation for the discontinuation
of LIBOR, we have amended, or will amend, our LIBOR-referencing agreements to either reference the
Secured Overnight Financing Rate or include mechanics for selecting an alternative rate, but it is
possible that these changes may have an adverse impact on our financing costs as compared to LIBOR in
the long term. Our interest expense may also be affected by our credit ratings. In assessing our
credit strength, credit rating agencies consider our capital structure and financial policies as well
as the consolidated balance sheet and other financial information of the Company. In addition, some
credit rating agencies also consider financial information of certain of our major bottling partners.
It is our expectation that the credit rating agencies will continue using this methodology. If our
credit ratings were to be downgraded as a result of changes in our capital structure; our major
bottling partners’ financial performance; changes in the credit rating agencies’ methodology in
assessing our credit strength; the credit agencies’ perception of the impact of credit market
conditions on our or our major bottling partners’ current or future financial performance and
financial condition; or for any other reason, our cost of borrowing could increase. Additionally, if
the credit ratings of certain bottling partners in which we have equity method investments were to be
downgraded, such bottling partners’ interest expense could increase, which would reduce our equity
income.
If we are unable to achieve our overall long-term growth objectives, the value of an investment in
our Company could be negatively affected.
We have established and publicly announced certain long-term growth objectives. These objectives are
based on, among other things, our evaluation of our growth prospects, which are generally driven by
the sales potential of our many beverage products, some of which are more profitable than others, and
on an assessment of the potential price and product mix. We may not be able to realize the sales
potential and the price and product mix necessary to achieve our long-term growth objectives.
Default by or failure of one or more of our counterparty financial institutions could cause us to
incur significant losses.
As part of our hedging activities, we enter into transactions involving derivative financial
instruments, including forward contracts, commodity futures contracts, option contracts, collars and
swaps, with various financial institutions. In addition, we have significant amounts of cash, cash
equivalents and other investments on deposit or in accounts with banks or other financial
institutions in the United States and abroad. As a result, we are exposed to the risk of default by
or failure of counterparty financial institutions. The risk of counterparty default or failure may be
heightened during economic downturns and periods of uncertainty in the financial markets. If one of
our counterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, our ability to recover losses
incurred as a result of default or to retrieve our assets that are deposited or held in accounts with
such counterparty may be limited by the counterparty’s liquidity or the applicable laws governing the
insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings. In the event of default by or failure of one or more of our
counterparties, we could incur significant losses, which could negatively impact our results of
operations and financial condition.
We may be required to recognize impairment charges that could materially affect our financial
results.
We assess our noncurrent assets, including trademarks, goodwill and other intangible assets, equity
method investments and other long-lived assets, as and when required by accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States to determine whether they are impaired and, if they are, we
record appropriate impairment charges. Our equity method investees also perform similar
recoverability and impairment tests, and we record our proportionate share of impairment charges
recorded by them adjusted, as appropriate, for the impact of items such as basis differences,
deferred taxes and deferred gains. It is possible that we may be required to record significant
impairment charges or our proportionate share of significant impairment charges recorded by equity
method investees in the future and, if we do so, our net income could be materially adversely
affected.
 RISKS RELATED TO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND DATA PRIVACY 
If we are unable to protect our information systems against service interruption, misappropriation of
data or cybersecurity incidents, our operations could be disrupted, we may suffer financial losses
and our reputation may be damaged.
We rely on networks and information systems and other technology (“information systems”), including
the Internet and third-party hosted services, to support a variety of business processes and
activities, including procurement and supply chain, manufacturing, distribution, invoicing and
collection of payments, employee processes, consumer marketing, mergers and acquisitions, and
research and development. We use information systems to process financial information and results of
operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting and
legal and tax requirements. In addition, we depend on information systems for digital marketing
activities and electronic communications among our locations around the world and between Company
employees and our bottlers, customers, suppliers, consumers and other third parties. Because
information systems are critical to many of the Company’s operating activities, our business may be
impacted by system shutdowns, service disruptions or cybersecurity incidents. These incidents may be
caused by failures during routine
 22 
operations, such as system upgrades, or by user errors, as well as network or hardware failures,
malicious or disruptive software, unintentional or malicious actions of employees or contractors,
cyberattacks by hackers, criminal groups or nation-state organizations (which may include social
engineering, business email compromise, cyber extortion, denial of service, or attempts to exploit
vulnerabilities), geopolitical events, natural disasters, failures or impairments of
telecommunications networks, or other catastrophic events. In addition, such cybersecurity incidents
could result in unauthorized or accidental access to or disclosure of material confidential
information or regulated personal data. If our information systems or third-party information systems
on which we rely suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans do
not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, we could experience delays in reporting our
financial results, and we may lose revenue and profits as a result of our inability to timely
manufacture, distribute, invoice and collect payments for concentrates or finished products.
Unauthorized or accidental access to, or destruction, loss, alteration, disclosure, falsification or
unavailability of, information, or unauthorized access to machines and equipment could result in
violations of data protection laws and regulations, misuse or malfunction of machines and equipment,
damage to the reputation and credibility of the Company, loss of opportunities to acquire or divest
of businesses or brands, and loss of ability to commercialize products developed through research and
development efforts and, therefore, could have a negative impact on net operating revenues. In
addition, we may suffer financial and reputational damage because of lost or misappropriated
confidential information belonging to us, our current or former employees, our bottling partners,
other customers or suppliers, or consumers or other data subjects, and may become exposed to legal
action and increased regulatory oversight, including governmental investigations, enforcement actions
and regulatory fines. The Company could also be required to spend significant financial and other
resources to remedy the damage caused by a cybersecurity incident or to repair or replace networks
and information systems. These risks also may be present to the extent any of our bottling partners,
distributors, joint venture partners or suppliers using separate information systems, not integrated
with the information systems of the Company, suffers a cybersecurity incident and could result in
increased costs related to involvement in investigations or notifications conducted by these third
parties. These risks may also be present to the extent a business we have acquired, but which does
not use our information systems, experiences severe damage, a system shutdown, service disruption, or
a cybersecurity incident.
Like most major corporations, the Company’s information systems are a target of attacks. In addition,
third-party providers of data hosting or cloud services, as well as our bottling partners,
distributors, joint venture partners, suppliers or acquired businesses that use separate information
systems, may experience cybersecurity incidents that may involve data we share with them. Although
the cybersecurity incidents that we have experienced to date, as well as those reported to us by our
third-party partners, have not had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results
of operations, such incidents could have a material adverse effect on us in the future. In order to
address risks to our information systems, we continue to make investments in personnel, technologies
and training. Data protection laws and regulations around the world often require “reasonable,”
“appropriate” or “adequate” technical and organizational security measures, and the interpretation
and application of those laws and regulations are often uncertain and evolving; there can be no
assurance that our security measures will be deemed adequate, appropriate or reasonable by a
regulator or court. Moreover, even security measures that are deemed adequate, appropriate,
reasonable or in accordance with applicable legal requirements may not protect the information we
maintain against increasingly sophisticated attacks. In addition to potential fines, we could be
subject to mandatory corrective action due to a cybersecurity incident, which could adversely affect
our business operations and result in substantial costs for years to come. While we have purchased
cybersecurity insurance, there are no assurances that the coverage would be adequate in relation to
any incurred losses. Moreover, as cyberattacks increase in frequency and magnitude, we may be unable
to obtain cybersecurity insurance in amounts and on terms we view as appropriate for our operations.
If we fail to comply with privacy and data protection laws, we could be subject to adverse publicity,
business disruption, data loss, government enforcement actions and/or private litigation, any of
which could negatively affect our business and operating results.
In the ordinary course of our business, we receive, process, transmit and store information relating
to identifiable individuals (“personal data”), including employees, former employees, vendors, third-
party personnel, customers and consumers with whom we interact. As a result, we are subject to a
variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations in numerous jurisdictions
regarding privacy and data protection. These privacy and data protection laws may be interpreted and
applied differently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and may create inconsistent or conflicting
requirements. In addition, new legislation in this area may be enacted in other jurisdictions at any
time. These laws impose operational requirements for companies receiving or processing personal data,
and many provide for significant penalties for noncompliance. Some laws and regulations also impose
obligations regarding cross-border data transfers of personal data. These requirements with respect
to personal data have subjected and may continue in the future to subject the Company to, among other
things, additional costs and expenses and have required and may in the future require costly changes
to our business practices and information technology and security systems, policies, procedures and
practices. In addition, some countries are considering or have enacted data localization or residency
laws, which require that certain data be maintained, stored and/or processed within their country of
origin. Maintaining local data centers in individual countries could increase our operating costs
significantly. Our security controls over personal data, the training of employees and vendors on
data privacy and data security, and the policies,
 23 
procedures and practices we have implemented or may implement in the future may not prevent the
improper disclosure of personal data by us or the third-party service providers and vendors whose
technology, systems and services we use in connection with the receipt, storage and transmission of
personal data. Unauthorized access to or improper disclosure of personal data in violation of privacy
and data protection laws could harm our reputation, cause loss of consumer confidence, subject us to
regulatory enforcement actions (including penalties, fines and investigations), and result in private
litigation against us, which could result in loss of revenue, increased costs, liability for monetary
damages, fines and/or criminal prosecution, all of which could negatively affect our business and
operating results. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, expenses to comply with privacy and
data protection standards and protocols imposed by law, regulation, industry standards and
contractual obligations. Increased regulation of data collection, use, disclosure and retention
practices, including self-regulation and industry standards, changes in existing laws and
regulations, enactment of new laws and regulations, increased enforcement activity, and changes in
interpretation of laws, could increase our cost of compliance and operation, limit our ability to
grow our business or otherwise harm our business.
 RISKS RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL FACTORS 
Our ability to achieve our sustainability goals and targets is subject to risks, many of which are
outside of our control, and our reputation and brands could be harmed if we fail to meet such goals.
Companies across all industries are facing increasing scrutiny from stakeholders related to
sustainability, including practices and disclosures related to sustainable packaging; water
stewardship; climate; health and nutrition; human rights; and diversity, equity and inclusion. Our
ability to achieve our sustainability goals and targets and to accurately and transparently report
our progress presents numerous operational, financial, legal and other risks, and is dependent on the
actions of our bottling partners, suppliers and other third parties, all of which are outside of our
control. If we are unable to meet our sustainability goals or evolving stakeholder expectations and
industry standards, or if we are perceived to have not responded appropriately to the growing concern
for sustainability issues, our reputation, and therefore our ability to sell products, could be
negatively impacted. In addition, in recent years, investor advocacy groups and certain institutional
investors have placed increasing importance on sustainability. If, as a result of their assessment of
our sustainability practices, certain investors are unsatisfied with our actions or progress, they
may reconsider their investment in our Company.
As the nature, scope and complexity of sustainability reporting, due diligence and disclosure
requirements expand, we may have to incur additional costs to control, assess and report on
sustainability metrics. Any failure or perceived failure, whether or not valid, to pursue or fulfill
our sustainability goals and targets or to satisfy various sustainability reporting standards within
the timelines we announce, or at all, could increase the risk of litigation.
Increasing concerns about the environmental impact of plastic bottles and other packaging materials
could result in reduced demand for our beverage products and increased production and distribution
costs.
There are increasing concerns among consumers, governments and other stakeholders about the damaging
impact of the accumulation of plastic bottles and other packaging materials in the environment,
particularly in the world’s waterways, lakes and oceans, as well as inefficient use of resources when
packaging materials are not included in a circular economy. We and our bottling partners sell certain
of our beverage products in plastic bottles and use other packaging materials that, while largely
recyclable, may not be regularly recovered and recycled due to lack of collection and recycling
infrastructure. If we and our bottling partners do not, or are perceived not to, act responsibly to
address plastic materials recoverability and recycling concerns and associated waste management
issues, our corporate image and brand reputation could be damaged, which may cause some consumers to
reduce or discontinue consumption of some of our beverage products. In addition, from time to time we
establish and publicly announce goals and targets to reduce the Coca-Cola system’s impact on the
environment by, for example, increasing our use of recycled content in our packaging materials;
increasing our use of packaging materials that are made in part of plant-based renewable materials;
expanding our use of reusable packaging (including refillable or returnable glass and plastic
bottles, as well as dispensed and fountain delivery models where consumers use refillable containers
for our beverages); participating in programs and initiatives to reclaim or recover bottles and other
packaging materials that are already in the environment; and taking other actions and participating
in other programs and initiatives organized or sponsored by nongovernmental organizations and other
groups. If we and our bottling partners fail to achieve or improperly report on our progress toward
achieving our announced environmental goals and targets, the resulting negative publicity could
adversely affect consumer preference for our products. In addition, in response to environmental
concerns, governmental entities in the United States and in many other jurisdictions around the world
have adopted, or are considering adopting, regulations and policies designed to mandate or encourage
plastic packaging waste reduction and an increase in recycling rates and/or recycled content
minimums, or, in some cases, restrict or even prohibit the use of certain plastic containers or
packaging materials. These regulations and policies, whatever their scope or form, could increase the
cost of our beverage products or otherwise put the Company at a competitive disadvantage. In
addition, our increased focus on reducing plastic containers and other packaging materials waste has
in the past and may continue to require us or our bottling partners to incur additional expenses and
to increase our capital expenditures. A reduction in consumer demand for our products and/or an
increase in costs and
 24 
expenditures relating to production and distribution as a result of these environmental concerns
regarding plastic bottles and other packaging materials could have an adverse effect on our business
and results of operations.
Water scarcity and poor quality could negatively impact the Coca-Cola system’s costs and capacity.
Water is a main ingredient in substantially all of our products, is vital to the production of the
agricultural ingredients on which our business relies and is needed in our manufacturing process. It
also is critical to the prosperity of the communities we serve and the ecosystems in which we
operate. Water is a limited resource in many parts of the world, facing unprecedented challenges from
overexploitation, increasing demand for food and other consumer and industrial products whose
manufacturing processes require water, increasing pollution and emerging awareness of potential
contaminants, poor management, lack of physical or financial access to water, sociopolitical tensions
due to lack of public infrastructure in certain areas of the world and the effects of climate change.
As the demand for water continues to increase around the world, and as water becomes scarcer and the
quality of available water deteriorates, the Coca-Cola system may incur higher costs or face capacity
constraints and the possibility of reputational damage, which could adversely affect our
profitability.
Increased demand for food products, decreased agricultural productivity and increased regulation of
ingredient sourcing due diligence may negatively affect our business.
As part of the manufacture of our beverage products, we and our bottling partners use a number of key
ingredients that are derived from agricultural commodities such as sugarcane, corn, sugar beets,
citrus, coffee and tea. Increased demand for food products; decreased agricultural productivity in
certain regions of the world as a result of changing weather patterns; increased agricultural
regulations, including regulation of ingredient sourcing due diligence; and other factors have in the
past, and may in the future, limit the availability and/or increase the cost of such agricultural
commodities and could impact the food security of communities around the world. If we are unable to
implement programs focused on economic opportunity and environmental sustainability to address these
agricultural challenges and fail to make a strategic impact on food security through joint efforts
with bottlers, farmers, communities, suppliers and key partners, as well as through our increased and
continued investment in sustainable agriculture, our ability to source raw materials for use in our
manufacturing processes and the affordability of our products and ultimately our business and results
of operations could be negatively impacted.
Climate change and legal or regulatory responses thereto may have a long-term adverse impact on our
business and results of operations.
There is increasing concern that a gradual increase in global average temperatures due to increased
concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is causing significant
changes in weather patterns around the globe and an increase in the frequency and severity of natural
disasters. Decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions of the world as a result of
changing weather patterns may limit the availability or increase the cost of key agricultural
commodities, such as sugarcane, corn, sugar beets, citrus, coffee and tea, which are important
ingredients for our products, and could impact the food security of communities around the world.
Climate change may also exacerbate extreme weather, resulting in water scarcity or flooding, and
cause a further deterioration of water quality in affected regions, which could limit water
availability for the Coca-Cola system’s bottling operations. Increased frequency or duration of
extreme weather conditions could also impair production capabilities, disrupt our supply chain or
impact demand for our products. Increasing concern over climate change also may result in additional
legal or regulatory requirements designed to reduce or mitigate the effects of carbon dioxide and
other greenhouse gas emissions on the environment, and/or may result in increased disclosure
obligations. Increased energy or compliance costs and expenses due to increased legal or regulatory
requirements may cause disruptions in, or an increase in the costs associated with, the manufacturing
and distribution of our beverage products. The effects of climate change and legal or regulatory
initiatives to address climate change could have a long-term adverse impact on our business and
results of operations. In addition, from time to time we establish and publicly announce goals and
targets to reduce the Coca-Cola system’s carbon footprint by increasing our use of recycled packaging
materials, expanding our renewable energy usage, and participating in environmental and
sustainability programs and initiatives organized or sponsored by nongovernmental organizations and
other groups to reduce greenhouse gas emissions industrywide. If we and our bottling partners fail to
achieve or improperly report on our progress toward achieving our carbon footprint reduction goals
and targets, the resulting negative publicity could adversely affect consumer preference for our
beverage products.
Adverse weather conditions could reduce the demand for our products.
The sales of our products are influenced to some extent by weather conditions in the markets in which
we operate. Unusually cold or rainy weather during the summer months may have a temporary effect on
the demand for our products and contribute to lower sales, which could have an adverse effect on our
results of operations for such periods.

Management believes that our Company’s facilities used for the production of our products are
suitable and adequate, that they are being appropriately utilized in line with past experience, and
that they have sufficient production capacity for their present intended purposes. The extent of
utilization of our production facilities varies based upon seasonal demand for our products. However,
management believes that additional production can be achieved at the existing facilities by adding
personnel and capital equipment or, at some facilities, by adding shifts of personnel or expanding
the facilities. We continuously review our anticipated requirements for facilities and, on the basis
of that review, may from time to time acquire or lease additional facilities and/or dispose of
existing facilities.

Aqua-Chem Litigation
On December 20, 2002, the Company filed a lawsuit (The Coca-Cola Company v. Aqua-Chem, Inc., Civil
Action No. 2002CV631-50) in the Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia (“Georgia Case”), seeking a
declaratory judgment that the Company has no obligation to its former subsidiary, Aqua-Chem, Inc.,
now known as Cleaver-Brooks, Inc. (“Aqua-Chem”), for any past, present or future liabilities or
expenses in connection with any claims or lawsuits against Aqua-Chem. Subsequent to the Company’s
filing but on the same day, Aqua-Chem filed a lawsuit (Aqua-Chem, Inc. v. The Coca-Cola Company,
Civil Action No. 02CV012179) in the Circuit Court, Civil Division of Milwaukee County, Wisconsin
(“Wisconsin Case”). In the Wisconsin Case, Aqua-Chem sought a declaratory judgment that the Company
is responsible for all liabilities and expenses not covered by insurance in connection with certain
of Aqua-Chem’s general and product liability claims arising from occurrences prior to the Company’s
sale of Aqua-Chem in 1981, and a judgment for breach of contract in an amount exceeding $9 million
for costs incurred by Aqua-Chem to date in connection with such claims. The Wisconsin Case initially
was stayed, pending final resolution of the Georgia Case, and later was voluntarily dismissed without
prejudice by Aqua-Chem.
The Company owned Aqua-Chem from 1970 to 1981. During that time, the Company purchased over $400
million of insurance coverage, which also insures Aqua-Chem for some of its prior and future costs
for certain product liability and other claims. The Company sold Aqua-Chem to Lyonnaise American
Holding, Inc., in 1981 under the terms of a stock sale agreement. The 1981 agreement, and a
subsequent 1983 settlement agreement, outlined the parties’ rights and obligations concerning past
and future claims and lawsuits involving Aqua-Chem. Cleaver-Brooks, a division of Aqua-Chem,
manufactured boilers, some of
 26 
which contained asbestos gaskets. Aqua-Chem was first named as a defendant in asbestos lawsuits in or
around 1985 and currently has approximately 15,000 active claims pending against it.
The parties agreed in 2004 to stay the Georgia Case pending the outcome of insurance coverage
litigation filed by certain Aqua-Chem insurers on March 26, 2004. In the coverage action, five
plaintiff insurance companies filed suit (Century Indemnity Company, et al. v. Aqua-Chem, Inc., The
Coca-Cola Company, et al., Case No. 04CV002852) in the Circuit Court, Civil Division of Milwaukee
County, Wisconsin, against the Company, Aqua-Chem and 16 insurance companies. Several of the policies
that were the subject of the coverage action had been issued to the Company during the period (1970
to 1981) when the Company owned Aqua-Chem. The complaint sought a determination of the respective
rights and obligations under the insurance policies issued with regard to asbestos-related claims
against Aqua-Chem. The action also sought a monetary judgment reimbursing any amounts paid by the
plaintiffs in excess of their obligations. Two of the insurers, one with a $15 million policy limit
and one with a $25 million policy limit, asserted cross-claims against the Company, alleging that the
Company and/or its insurers are responsible for Aqua-Chem’s asbestos liabilities before any
obligation is triggered on the part of the cross-claimant insurers to pay for such costs under their
policies.
Aqua-Chem and the Company filed and obtained a partial summary judgment determination in the coverage
action that the insurers for Aqua-Chem and the Company were jointly and severally liable for coverage
amounts, but reserving judgment on other defenses that might apply. During the course of the
Wisconsin insurance coverage litigation, Aqua-Chem and the Company reached settlements with several
of the insurers, including plaintiffs, who paid funds into escrow accounts for payment of costs
arising from the asbestos claims against Aqua-Chem. On July 24, 2007, the Wisconsin trial court
entered a final declaratory judgment regarding the rights and obligations of the parties under the
insurance policies issued by the remaining defendant insurers, which judgment was not appealed. The
judgment directs, among other things, that each insurer whose policy is triggered is jointly and
severally liable for 100 percent of Aqua-Chem’s losses up to policy limits. The court’s judgment
concluded the Wisconsin insurance coverage litigation.
The Company and Aqua-Chem continued to pursue and obtain coverage agreements for the asbestos-related
claims against Aqua-Chem with those insurance companies that did not settle in the Wisconsin
insurance coverage litigation. The Company anticipated that a final settlement with three of those
insurers (“Chartis insurers”) would be finalized in May 2011, but the Chartis insurers repudiated
their settlement commitments and, as a result, Aqua-Chem and the Company filed suit against them in
Wisconsin state court to enforce the coverage-in-place settlement or, in the alternative, to obtain a
declaratory judgment validating Aqua-Chem and the Company’s interpretation of the court’s judgment in
the Wisconsin insurance coverage litigation.
In February 2012, the parties filed and argued a number of cross-motions for summary judgment related
to the issues of the enforceability of the settlement agreement and the exhaustion of policies
underlying those of the Chartis insurers. The court granted defendants’ motions for summary judgment
that the 2011 Settlement Agreement and 2010 Term Sheet were not binding contracts, but denied their
similar motions related to plaintiffs’ claims for promissory and/or equitable estoppel. On or about
May 15, 2012, the parties entered into a mutually agreeable settlement/stipulation resolving two
major issues: exhaustion of underlying coverage and control of defense. On or about January 10, 2013,
the parties reached a settlement of the estoppel claims and all of the remaining coverage issues,
with the exception of one disputed issue relating to the scope of the Chartis insurers’ defense
obligations in two policy years. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the Company and
Aqua-Chem on that one open issue and entered a final appealable judgment to that effect following the
parties’ settlement. On January 23, 2013, the Chartis insurers filed a notice of appeal of the trial
court’s summary judgment ruling. On October 29, 2013, the Wisconsin Court of Appeals affirmed the
grant of summary judgment in favor of the Company and Aqua-Chem. On November 27, 2013, the Chartis
insurers filed a petition for review in the Supreme Court of Wisconsin, and on December 11, 2013, the
Company filed its opposition to that petition. On April 16, 2014, the Supreme Court of Wisconsin
denied the Chartis insurers’ petition for review.
The Georgia Case remains subject to the stay agreed to in 2004.
U.S. Federal Income Tax Dispute
On September 17, 2015, the Company received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency (“Notice”) from the IRS
seeking approximately $ 3.3billion of additional federal income tax for years 2007 through 2009. In
the Notice, the IRS stated its intent to reallocate over $9 billion of income to the U.S. parent
company from certain of its foreign affiliates that the U.S. parent company licensed to manufacture,
distribute, sell, market and promote its products in certain non-U.S. markets.
The Notice concerned the Company’s transfer pricing between its U.S. parent company and certain of
its foreign affiliates. IRS rules governing transfer pricing require arm’s-length pricing of
transactions between related parties such as the Company’s U.S. parent and its foreign affiliates.
To resolve the same transfer pricing issue for the tax years 1987 through 1995, the Company and the
IRS had agreed in 1996 on an arm’s-length methodology for determining the amount of U.S. taxable
income that the U.S. parent company would report as
 27 
compensation from its foreign licensees. The Company and the IRS memorialized this accord in a
closing agreement resolving that dispute (“Closing Agreement”). The Closing Agreement provided that,
absent a change in material facts or circumstances or relevant federal tax law, in calculating the
Company’s income taxes going forward, the Company would not be assessed penalties by the IRS for
using the agreed-upon tax calculation methodology that the Company and the IRS agreed would be used
for the 1987 through 1995 tax years.
The IRS audited and confirmed the Company’s compliance with the agreed-upon Closing Agreement
methodology in five successive audit cycles for tax years 1996 through 2006.
The September 17, 2015 Notice from the IRS retroactively rejected the previously agreed-upon
methodology for the 2007 through 2009 tax years in favor of an entirely different methodology,
without prior notice to the Company. Using the new tax calculation methodology, the IRS reallocated
over $9 billion of income to the U.S. parent company from its foreign licensees for tax years 2007
through 2009. Consistent with the Closing Agreement, the IRS did not assert penalties, and it has yet
to do so.
The IRS designated the Company’s matter for litigation on October 15, 2015. Litigation designation is
an IRS determination that forecloses to a company any and all alternative means for resolution of a
tax dispute. As a result of the IRS’ designation of the Company’s matter for litigation, the Company
was forced to either accept the IRS’ newly imposed tax assessment and pay the full amount of the
asserted tax or litigate the matter in the federal courts. The matter remains subject to the IRS’
litigation designation, preventing the Company from any attempt to settle or otherwise mutually
resolve the matter with the IRS.
The Company consequently initiated litigation by filing a petition in the Tax Court in December 2015,
challenging the tax adjustments enumerated in the Notice.
Prior to trial, the IRS increased its transfer pricing adjustment by $ 385million, resulting in an
additional tax adjustment of $ 135million. The Company obtained a summary judgment in its favor on a
different matter related to Mexican foreign tax credits, which thereafter effectively reduced the
IRS’ potential tax adjustment by $ 138million.
The trial was held in the Tax Court from March through May 2018, and final post-trial briefs were
filed and exchanged in April 2019.
On November 18, 2020, the Tax Court issued the Opinion in which it predominantly sided with the IRS
but agreed with the Company that dividends previously paid by the foreign licensees to the U.S.
parent company in reliance upon the Closing Agreement should continue to be allowed to offset
royalties, including those that would become payable to the Company in accordance with the Opinion.
The Tax Court reserved ruling on the effect of Brazilian legal restrictions on the payment of
royalties by the Company’s licensee in Brazil until after the Tax Court issues its opinion in the
separate case of 3M Co. & Subs. v. Commissioner, T.C. Docket No. 5816-13 (filed March 11, 2013). The
Tax Court issued its opinion in 3M Co.’s case (“3M Co. opinion”) on February 9, 2023. Once the Tax
Court completes its analysis of the application of the 3M Co. opinion to the Company’s case, the
Company expects the Tax Court to render another opinion, and ultimately a final decision, in the
Company’s case.
The Company believes that the IRS and the Tax Court misinterpreted and misapplied the applicable
regulations in reallocating income earned by the Company’s foreign licensees to increase the
Company’s U.S. tax. Moreover, the Company believes that the retroactive imposition of such tax
liability using a calculation methodology different from that previously agreed upon by the IRS and
the Company, and audited by the IRS for over a decade, is unconstitutional. The Company intends to
assert its claims on appeal and vigorously defend its position.
In determining the amount of tax reserve to be recorded as of December 31, 2020, the Company
completed the required two-step evaluation process prescribed by Accounting Standards Codification
740, Accounting for Income Taxes . In doing so, we consulted with outside advisors, and we reviewed
and considered relevant laws, rules, and regulations, including, but not limited to, the Opinion and
relevant caselaw. We also considered our intention to vigorously defend our positions and assert our
various well-founded legal claims via every available avenue of appeal. We concluded, based on the
technical and legal merits of the Company’s tax positions, that it is more likely than not the
Company’s tax positions will ultimately be sustained on appeal. In addition, we considered a number
of alternative transfer pricing methodologies, including the methodology asserted by the IRS and
affirmed in the Opinion (“Tax Court Methodology”), that could be applied by the courts upon final
resolution of the litigation. Based on the required probability analysis, we determined the
methodologies we believe the federal courts could ultimately order to be used in calculating the
Company’s tax. As a result of this analysis, we recorded a tax reserve of $ 438million during the
year ended December 31, 2020 related to the application of the resulting methodologies as well as the
different tax treatment applicable to dividends originally paid to the U.S. parent company by its
foreign licensees, in reliance upon the Closing Agreement, that would be recharacterized as royalties
in accordance with the Opinion and the Company’s analysis.
The Company’s conclusion that it is more likely than not the Company’s tax positions will ultimately
be sustained on appeal is unchanged as of December 31, 2022. However, we updated our calculation of
the methodologies we believe the federal courts
 28 
could ultimately order to be used in calculating the Company’s tax. As a result of the application of
the required probability analysis to these updated calculations and the accrual of interest through
the current reporting period, we updated our tax reserve as of December 31, 2022 to $ 423million.
While the Company strongly disagrees with the IRS’ positions and the portions of the Opinion
affirming such positions, it is possible that some portion or all of the adjustment proposed by the
IRS and sustained by the Tax Court could ultimately be upheld. In that event, the Company would
likely be subject to significant additional liabilities for tax years 2007 through 2009, and
potentially also for subsequent years, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s
financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
The Company calculated the potential impact of applying the Tax Court Methodology to reallocate
income from foreign licensees potentially covered within the scope of the Opinion, assuming such
methodology were to be ultimately upheld by the courts, and the IRS were to decide to apply that
methodology to subsequent years, with consent of the federal courts. This impact would include taxes
and interest accrued through December 31, 2022 for the 2007 through 2009 litigated tax years and for
subsequent tax years from 2010 through 2022. The calculations incorporated the estimated impact of
correlative adjustments to the previously accrued transition tax payable under the Tax Reform Act.
The Company estimates that the potential aggregate incremental tax and interest liability could be
approximately $ 14billion as of December 31, 2022. Additional income tax and interest would continue
to accrue until the time any such potential liability, or portion thereof, were to be paid. We
currently project the continued application of the Tax Court Methodology in future years, assuming
similar facts and circumstances as of December 31, 2022, would result in an incremental annual tax
liability that would increase the Company’s effective tax rate by approximately 3.5percent.
The Company does not know when the Tax Court will issue its opinion regarding the effect of Brazilian
legal restrictions on the payment of royalties by the Company’s licensee in Brazil for the 2007
through 2009 tax years. After the Tax Court issues its opinion on the Company’s Brazilian licensee,
the Company and the IRS will be provided time to agree on the tax impact, if any, of both opinions,
after which the Tax Court would render a final decision in the case. The Company will have 90 days
thereafter to file a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit and pay
the tax liability and interest related to the 2007 through 2009 tax years. The Company currently
estimates that the payment to be made at that time related to the 2007 through 2009 tax years, which
is included in the above estimate of the potential aggregate incremental tax and interest liability,
would be approximately $ 5.2billion (including interest accrued through December 31, 2022), plus any
additional interest accrued through the time of payment. Some or all of this amount would be refunded
if the Company were to prevail on appeal.

To better align with the Company’s direct competitors, the Company has chosen to change the peer

 OUR BUSINESS 
 General 
The Coca-Cola Company is a total beverage company, and beverage products bearing our trademarks, sold
in the United States since 1886, are now sold in more than 200 countries and territories. We own or
license and market numerous beverage brands, which we group into the following categories: Trademark
Coca-Cola; sparkling flavors; water, sports, coffee and tea; juice, value-added dairy and plant-based
beverages; and emerging beverages. We own and market five of the world’s top six nonalcoholic
sparkling soft drink brands: Coca-Cola, Sprite, Fanta, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar and Diet Coke/Coca-Cola
Light.
We make our branded beverage products available to consumers throughout the world through our network
of independent bottling partners, distributors, wholesalers and retailers as well as the Company’s
consolidated bottling and distribution operations. Beverages bearing trademarks owned by or licensed
to us account for 2.2 billion of the estimated 64 billion servings of all beverages consumed
worldwide every day.
We believe our success depends on our ability to connect with consumers by providing them with a wide
variety of beverage options to meet their desires, needs and lifestyles. Our success further depends
on the ability of our people to execute effectively, every day.
Our Company markets, manufactures and sells:
• beverage concentrates, sometimes referred to as “beverage bases,” and syrups, including fountain
syrups (we refer to this part of our business as our “concentrate operations”); and
• finished sparkling soft drinks and other beverages (we refer to this part of our business as our
“finished product operations”).
Generally, finished product operations generate higher net operating revenues but lower gross profit
margins than concentrate operations.
Our concentrate operations typically generate net operating revenues by selling concentrates, syrups
and certain finished beverages to authorized bottling operations (to which we typically refer as our
“bottlers” or our “bottling partners”). Our bottling partners either combine concentrates with still
or sparkling water and sweeteners (depending on the product), or combine syrups with still or
sparkling water, to produce finished beverages. The finished beverages are packaged in authorized
containers, such as cans and refillable and nonrefillable glass and plastic bottles, bearing our
trademarks or trademarks licensed to us and are then sold to retailers directly or, in some cases,
through wholesalers or other bottlers. In addition, outside the
 33 
United States, our bottling partners are typically authorized to manufacture fountain syrups, using
our concentrates, which they sell to fountain retailers for use in producing beverages for immediate
consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers who in turn sell and distribute the fountain
syrups to fountain retailers. Our concentrate operations are included in our geographic operating
segments and our Global Ventures operating segment.
Our finished product operations generate net operating revenues by selling sparkling soft drinks and
a variety of other finished beverages to retailers, or to distributors and wholesalers who in turn
sell the beverages to retailers. These operations consist primarily of our consolidated bottling and
distribution operations, which are included in our Bottling Investments operating segment. In certain
markets, the Company also operates non-bottling finished product operations in which we sell finished
beverages to distributors and wholesalers that are generally not one of the Company’s bottling
partners. These operations are generally included in one of our geographic operating segments or our
Global Ventures operating segment. Additionally, we sell directly to consumers through retail stores
operated by Costa. These sales are included in our Global Ventures operating segment. In the United
States, we manufacture fountain syrups and sell them to fountain retailers, who use the fountain
syrups to produce beverages for immediate consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers or
bottling partners who in turn sell the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. These fountain syrup
sales are included in our North America operating segment.
The following table sets forth the percentage of total net operating revenues attributable to
concentrate operations and finished product operations:

We operate in the highly competitive commercial beverage industry. We face strong competition from
numerous other general and specialty beverage companies. We, along with other beverage companies, are
affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the cost to manufacture and
distribute products, consumer spending, economic conditions, availability and quality of water,
consumer preferences, inflation, geopolitical conditions, local and national laws and regulations,
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, fuel prices, weather patterns and the COVID-19 pandemic.
On March 8, 2022, the Company announced the suspension of its business in Russia as a result of the
conflict between Russia and Ukraine. In addition, the conflict has caused a disruption of our
business in Ukraine. The Company will continue to monitor and assess the situation as circumstances
evolve. As a point of reference, in 2021, the Company’s business in Russia and Ukraine contributed 2
percent of the Company’s unit case volume and 1 percent and 2 percent of the Company’s consolidated
net operating revenues and operating income, respectively.
Throughout 2022, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the resurgence of the virus in
certain countries and the related actions by governments to attempt to contain the spread of the
virus, continued to negatively impact our business. While uncertainties caused by the COVID-19
pandemic remain, and factors such as the state of the supply chain, labor shortages and the
inflationary environment are likely to impact the pace of the economic recovery, we are focused on
executing for growth.
Despite the dynamic world in which we are currently operating, we believe we are well positioned to
create value for our Company and our stakeholders. In an effort to support our future growth, we are
continuing to invest in our portfolio of brands, our strategic capabilities and our people. We are
focused on the following strategic priorities: unlocking the potential of our portfolio of strong
global, regional and scaled local brands; developing a robust innovation pipeline focusing on
scalable initiatives; increasing consumer-centric marketing effectiveness and efficiency; winning in
the marketplace with aligned data-driven revenue growth management and execution capabilities; and
further embedding sustainability goals into our operations.

 Challenges and Risks 
Being a global enterprise provides unique opportunities for our Company. Challenges and risks
accompany those opportunities. Our management has identified certain challenges and risks that demand
the attention of our Company and the commercial beverage industry. Of these, five key challenges and
risks are discussed below.
Obesity
Obesity continues to impact communities and countries worldwide. There is growing concern among
consumers, public health professionals and governments about the health problems associated with
obesity. This concern represents a significant challenge to our industry. We understand that obesity
is a complex public health challenge, and we are committed to being a part of the solution.
We recognize the uniqueness of consumers’ lifestyles and dietary choices. Therefore, we continue to:
• offer an expanded portfolio of beverage choices, including reduced-, low- and no-calorie beverage
options;
• provide transparent nutrition information, featuring calories on the front of most of our packages;
• provide our beverages in a range of packaging sizes, including small sizes to enable portion
control; and
• market responsibly, including no advertising targeted to children under 13.
The heritage of our Company is to lead, and innovation is critical for leadership. As such, we are
resolute in continuing to innovate and are committed to partnering to find winning solutions in the
area of noncaloric sweeteners. This includes working to reduce sugar and calories in many of our
beverages. We want to be a helpful and credible partner in the fight against obesity. Across the
Coca-Cola system, we are mobilizing our assets in marketing and in community outreach to increase
awareness and spur action.
Evolving Consumer Product Preferences
We are impacted by shifting consumer demographics and needs, on-the-go lifestyles and consumers who
are empowered with more information than ever. As a consequence of these changes, many consumers want
more beverage choices, personalization, a focus on sustainability, and transparency related to our
products and packaging. We are committed to meeting changing consumer needs and to generating growth
through our evolving portfolio of beverage brands and products (including numerous low- and no-
calorie products); selectively expanding into other profitable categories of the commercial beverage
industry; innovative and sustainable packaging; and ingredient education efforts.
Evolving Competitive Landscape and Competing in the Digital Marketplace
Our Company faces strong competition from well-established global companies as well as numerous
regional and local companies. Additionally, the rapidly evolving digital landscape and growth of
e-commerce in many markets has led to dramatic shifts in consumer shopping habits and patterns.
Consumers are rapidly embracing shopping via mobile device applications, e-commerce retailers and
e-commerce websites or platforms, which presents new challenges to maintain the competitiveness and
relevancy of our brands. As a result, we must continuously strengthen our capabilities in marketing
and innovation to compete in a digital environment and maintain brand loyalty and market share. In
addition, we are increasing our investments in e-commerce to support retail and meal delivery
services, offering more package sizes that are fit-for-purpose for online sales, and shifting more
consumer and trade promotions to digital.
Product Safety and Quality
We strive to meet the highest standards in both product safety and product quality. We are aware that
some consumers have concerns and negative viewpoints regarding certain ingredients used in our
products. The Coca-Cola system works every day to produce high quality, safe and refreshing beverages
for consumers around the world. We have rigorous product and ingredient safety and quality standards
designed to ensure safety and quality in each of our products, and we drive innovation that provides
new beverage options to satisfy consumers’ evolving needs and preferences.
We work to ensure consistent safety and quality through strong governance and compliance with
applicable regulations and standards. We stay current with new regulations, industry best practices
and marketplace conditions, and we engage with standard-setting and industry organizations.
Additionally, we manufacture and distribute our products according to strict policies, requirements
and specifications set forth in an integrated quality management program that continually measures
all operations within the Coca-Cola system against the same stringent standards. Our quality
management program also identifies and mitigates risks and drives improvement. In our quality
laboratories, we stringently measure the quality attributes of ingredients as well as samples of
finished products collected from the marketplace.
 35 
We perform due diligence to ensure that product and ingredient safety and quality standards are
maintained in the more than 200 countries and territories where our products are sold. We regularly
assess the relevance of our requirements and standards and continually work to improve and refine
them across our entire supply chain.
Sustainability Matters
As investors and stakeholders increasingly focus on sustainability matters, our Company and companies
across all industries are facing challenges and risks related to, among other things, sustainable
packaging; water stewardship; climate; health and nutrition; human rights; and diversity, equity and
inclusion. Where these challenges and risks relate to our business, we acknowledge that we have a
role to play in developing and implementing solutions related to these important challenges. We have
established specific sustainability focus areas: water quality and scarcity; packaging materials used
for our products; reduction of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions; sustainable
sourcing of agricultural commodities; diversity, equity and inclusion; and human and workplace
rights. Our ability to achieve our sustainability goals is dependent on many factors, including, but
not limited to, our actions along with the actions of various stakeholders, such as our bottling
partners, suppliers, governments, nongovernmental organizations, communities, and other third
parties, all of which are outside of our control.
See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in Part I of this report for additional information about risks and
uncertainties facing our Company.
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”), which require management to make estimates, judgments
and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and
accompanying notes. We believe our most critical accounting policies and estimates relate to the
following:
• Principles of Consolidation
• Recoverability of Current and Noncurrent Assets
• Pension Plan Valuations
• Revenue Recognition
• Income Taxes
Management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of critical accounting policies
and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Company’s Board of Directors. While our estimates and
assumptions are based on our knowledge of current events and on actions we may undertake in the
future, actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates and assumptions. For a discussion
of the Company’s significant accounting policies, refer to Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.
 Principles of Consolidation 
Our Company consolidates all entities that we control by ownership of a majority voting interest.
Additionally, there are situations in which consolidation is required even though the usual condition
of consolidation (i.e., ownership of a majority voting interest) does not apply. Generally, this
occurs when an entity holds an interest in another business enterprise that was achieved through
arrangements that do not involve voting interests, which results in a disproportionate relationship
between such entity’s voting interests in, and its exposure to the economic risks and potential
rewards of, the other business enterprise. This disproportionate relationship results in what is
known as a variable interest, and the entity in which another entity holds a variable interest is
referred to as a “VIE.” An enterprise must consolidate a VIE if it is determined to be the primary
beneficiary of the VIE. The primary beneficiary has both (1) the power to direct the activities of
the VIE that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and (2) the obligation to
absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to
the VIE.
Our Company holds interests in certain VIEs, primarily bottling operations, for which we were not
determined to be the primary beneficiary. Our variable interests in these VIEs primarily relate to
equity investments, profit guarantees or subordinated financial support. Refer to Note 11 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements. Although these financial arrangements resulted in our holding
variable interests in these entities, they did not empower us to direct the activities of the VIEs
that most significantly impact the VIEs’ economic performance. Creditors of our VIEs do not have
recourse against the general credit of the Company, regardless of whether the VIEs are accounted for
as consolidated entities.
We use the equity method to account for investments in companies if our investment provides us with
the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the
investee. Our consolidated net income includes our
 36 
Company’s proportionate share of the net income or loss of these companies. Our judgment regarding
the level of influence over each equity method investee includes considering key factors, such as our
ownership interest, representation on the board of directors, participation in policy-making
decisions and material intercompany transactions.
We eliminate from our financial results all significant intercompany transactions, including the
intercompany transactions with consolidated VIEs and the intercompany portion of transactions with
equity method investees.
 Recoverability of Current and Noncurrent Assets 
Our Company faces many uncertainties and risks related to various economic, political and regulatory
environments in the countries and territories in which we operate, particularly in developing and
emerging markets. Refer to the heading “Our Business — Challenges and Risks” above and “Item 1A. Risk
Factors” in Part I of this report. As a result, management must make numerous assumptions, which
involve a significant amount of judgment, when performing recoverability and impairment tests of
current and noncurrent assets in various regions around the world.
We perform recoverability and impairment tests of current and noncurrent assets in accordance with
U.S. GAAP. For certain assets, recoverability and/or impairment tests are required only when
conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. For other assets,
impairment tests are required at least annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances
indicate that an asset may be impaired.
The performance of recoverability and impairment tests of current and noncurrent assets involves
critical accounting estimates. These estimates require significant management judgment, include
inherent uncertainties and are often interdependent; therefore, they do not change in isolation.
Factors that management must estimate include, among others, the economic lives of the assets, sales
volume, pricing, royalty rates, cost of raw materials, delivery costs, the impact of any supply chain
disruptions, inflation, long-term growth rates, cost of capital, marketing spending, foreign currency
exchange rates, tax rates, capital spending, proceeds from the sale of assets and customers’
financial condition. The variability of these factors depends on a number of conditions, and thus our
accounting estimates may change from period to period. These factors are even more difficult to
estimate as a result of uncertainties associated with the scope, severity and duration of the global
COVID-19 pandemic. The estimates we use when performing recoverability tests of assets are consistent
with those we use in our internal planning. When performing impairment tests, we estimate the fair
values of the assets using management’s best assumptions, which we believe are consistent with those
a market participant would use. The Company has certain intangible and other long-lived assets that
are more dependent on cash flows generated in away-from-home channels and/or that generate cash flows
in geographic areas which are more heavily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and therefore these
assets are more susceptible to impairment. In addition, intangible and other long-lived assets we
acquired in recent transactions are naturally more susceptible to impairment, because they are
recorded at fair value based on recent operating plans and macroeconomic conditions at the time of
acquisition. If we had used other assumptions and estimates when impairment tests were performed,
impairment charges could have resulted. Furthermore, if management uses different assumptions in
future periods, or if different conditions exist in future periods, impairment charges could result.
The total future impairment charges we may be required to record could be material. Refer to Note 2
of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent acquisitions. Refer to Note
16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the discussion of impairment charges. Refer to
the heading “Operations Review” below for additional information related to our present business
environment.
As of December 31, 2022, the carrying value of our investment in Coca-Cola Bottlers Japan Holdings
Inc. (“CCBJHI”) exceeded its fair value by $29 million, or 8 percent. Based on the length of time and
the extent to which the fair value has been less than our carrying value and our intent and ability
to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in
market value, management determined that the decline in fair value was temporary in nature.
Therefore, we did not record an impairment charge related to the investment.
Our equity method investees also perform such recoverability and impairment tests. If an impairment
charge is recorded by one of our equity method investees, the Company records its proportionate share
of such charge as a reduction of equity income (loss) — net in our consolidated statement of income.
However, the actual amount we record with respect to our proportionate share of such charge may be
impacted by items such as basis differences, deferred taxes and deferred gains.
Investments in Equity and Debt Securities
We measure all equity investments that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under
the equity method at fair value with the change in fair value included in net income. We use quoted
market prices to determine the fair value of equity securities with readily determinable fair values.
For equity securities without readily determinable fair values, we have elected the measurement
alternative under which we measure these investments at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus
changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a
similar investment of the same issuer. Management assesses each of these investments on an individual
basis.
 37 
Our investments in debt securities are carried at either amortized cost or fair value. The cost basis
is determined by the specific identification method. Investments in debt securities that the Company
has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost and classified
as held-to-maturity. Investments in debt securities that are not classified as held-to-maturity are
carried at fair value and classified as either trading or available-for-sale. Realized and unrealized
gains and losses on trading debt securities as well as realized gains and losses on available-for-
sale debt securities are included in net income. Unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, on
available-for-sale debt securities are included in our consolidated balance sheet as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), except for the changes in fair values attributable to
the currency risk being hedged, if applicable, which are included in net income.
Equity securities with readily determinable fair values that are not accounted for under the equity
method and debt securities classified as trading are not assessed for impairment, since they are
carried at fair value with the change in fair value included in net income. Equity method
investments, equity securities without readily determinable fair values and debt securities
classified as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity are reviewed each reporting period to determine
whether a significant event or change in circumstances has occurred that may have an adverse effect
on the fair value of each investment. When such events or changes occur, we evaluate the fair value
compared to our cost basis in the investment. We also perform this evaluation every reporting period
for each investment for which our cost basis has exceeded the fair value. The fair values of most of
our Company’s investments in publicly traded companies are often readily available based on quoted
market prices. For investments in nonpublicly traded companies, management’s assessment of fair value
is based on various valuation methodologies, including discounted cash flows, estimates of sales
proceeds, and appraisals, as appropriate. We consider the assumptions that we believe a market
participant would use in evaluating estimated future cash flows when employing the discounted cash
flow or estimates of sales proceeds valuation methodologies. The ability to accurately predict future
cash flows, especially in emerging and developing markets, may impact the determination of fair
value. In the event the fair value of an investment declines below our cost basis, management is
required to determine if the decline in fair value is other than temporary. If management determines
the decline is other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded. Management’s assessment as to
the nature of a decline in fair value is based on, among other things, the length of time and the
extent to which the market value has been less than our cost basis; the financial condition and near-
term prospects of the issuer; and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of
time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.
Property, Plant and Equipment
Certain events or changes in circumstances may indicate that the recoverability of the carrying
amount or remaining useful life of property, plant and equipment should be assessed, including, among
others, the manner or length of time in which the Company intends to use the asset, a significant
decrease in market value, a significant change in the business climate in a particular market, or a
current period operating or cash flow loss combined with historical losses and/or projected future
losses. When such events or changes in circumstances are present and a recoverability test is
performed, we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset or asset
group and its eventual disposition. These estimated future cash flows are consistent with those we
use in our internal planning. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without
interest charges) is less than the carrying amount, we recognize an impairment charge. The impairment
charge recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. We use a variety
of methodologies to determine the fair value of property, plant and equipment, including appraisals
and discounted cash flow models. These appraisals and models include assumptions we believe are
consistent with those a market participant would use.
Goodwill, Trademarks and Other Intangible Assets
Intangible assets are classified into three categories: (1) intangible assets with definite lives
subject to amortization; (2) intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization; and
(3) goodwill. For intangible assets with definite lives, recoverability tests must be performed if
conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. For intangible assets with
indefinite lives and goodwill, impairment tests must be performed at least annually, or more
frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired.
The performance of recoverability and impairment tests of intangible assets involves critical
accounting estimates. These estimates require significant management judgment, include inherent
uncertainties and are often interdependent; therefore, they do not change in isolation. Factors that
management must estimate include, among others, the economic lives of the assets, sales volume,
pricing, royalty rates, cost of raw materials, delivery costs, the impact of any supply chain
disruptions, inflation, long-term growth rates, cost of capital, marketing spending, foreign currency
exchange rates, tax rates, capital spending, proceeds from the sale of assets and customers’
financial condition. These factors are even more difficult to predict when global financial markets
are highly volatile. The estimates we use when performing recoverability tests of intangible assets
are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. When performing impairment tests, we
estimate the fair values of the assets using management’s best assumptions, which we believe are
consistent with those a market participant would use. The estimates and assumptions used in these
tests are evaluated and updated as appropriate. The variability of these factors depends on a number
 38 
of conditions, including uncertainty about future events, and thus our accounting estimates may
change from period to period. If other assumptions and estimates had been used when these tests were
performed, impairment charges could have resulted. As mentioned above, these factors do not change in
isolation and, therefore, we do not believe it is practicable or meaningful to present the impact of
changing a single factor. Furthermore, if management uses different assumptions in future periods or
if different conditions exist in future periods, impairment charges could result. Refer to the
heading “Operations Review” below for additional information related to our present business
environment.
Intangible assets acquired in recent transactions are naturally more susceptible to impairment,
because they are recorded at fair value based on recent operating plans and macroeconomic conditions
present at the time of acquisition. Consequently, if operating results and/or macroeconomic
conditions deteriorate shortly after an acquisition, it could result in the impairment of the
acquired assets. A deterioration of macroeconomic conditions may not only negatively impact the
estimated operating cash flows used in our cash flow models but may also negatively impact other
assumptions used in our analyses, including, but not limited to, the estimated cost of capital and/or
discount rates. Additionally, we are required to ensure that the assumptions used to determine fair
value in our analyses are consistent with the assumptions that we believe a market participant would
use. As a result, the cost of capital and/or discount rates used in our analyses may increase or
decrease based on market conditions and trends, regardless of whether our Company’s actual cost of
capital has changed. Therefore, if the cost of capital and/or discount rates change, our Company may
recognize an impairment of an intangible asset in spite of realizing actual cash flows that are equal
to, or greater than, our previously forecasted amounts.
We perform impairment tests of goodwill at our reporting unit level, which is generally one level
below our operating segments. Our operating segments are primarily based on geographic
responsibility, which is consistent with the way management runs our business. Our geographic
operating segments are generally subdivided into smaller geographic regions. These geographic regions
are our reporting units. Our Global Ventures operating segment includes the results of our Costa,
innocent and doğadan businesses, as well as fees earned pursuant to distribution coordination
agreements between the Company and Monster, each of which is its own reporting unit. The Bottling
Investments operating segment includes all of our consolidated bottling operations, regardless of
geographic location. Generally, each consolidated bottling operation within our Bottling Investments
operating segment is its own reporting unit. Goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit or units that
benefit from the synergies arising from each business combination.
In order to test for goodwill impairment, the Company compares the fair value of the reporting unit
to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its
carrying amount, goodwill is written down for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the
reporting unit’s fair value. However, the impairment charge recognized cannot exceed the carrying
amount of goodwill. We typically use discounted cash flow models to determine the fair value of a
reporting unit. The assumptions used in these models are consistent with those we believe a market
participant would use. The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill
rather than completing the impairment test. The Company must assess whether it is more likely than
not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the Company
concludes that this is the case, it must perform the impairment testing discussed above. Otherwise,
the Company does not need to perform any further assessment.
When events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of definite-lived intangible assets may
not be recoverable, management performs a recoverability test of the carrying value by preparing
estimates of sales volume and the resulting gross profit and cash flows. These estimated future cash
flows are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. If the sum of the expected future
cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount of the asset
or asset group, we recognize an impairment charge. The impairment charge recognized is the amount by
which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. We use a variety of methodologies to determine the
fair value of these assets, including discounted cash flow models. These models include assumptions
we believe are consistent with those a market participant would use.
We test indefinite-lived intangible assets, including trademarks, franchise rights and goodwill, for
impairment annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an asset may be
impaired. Our Company performs these annual impairment tests as of the first day of our third fiscal
quarter. We use a variety of methodologies in conducting impairment tests of indefinite-lived
intangible assets, including, but not limited to, discounted cash flow models. These models include
assumptions we believe are consistent with those a market participant would use. For indefinite-lived
intangible assets, other than goodwill, if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment
charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The Company has the option to perform a
qualitative assessment of indefinite-lived intangible assets, other than goodwill, rather than
completing the impairment test. The Company must assess whether it is more likely than not that the
fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. If the Company concludes that
this is the case, it must perform the impairment testing described above. Otherwise, the Company does
not need to perform any further assessment.
 39 
 Pension Plan Valuations 
Our Company sponsors a qualified pension plan covering substantially all U.S. employees as well as
unfunded nonqualified pension plans for certain employees in the United States. In addition, our
Company and its subsidiaries have various pension plans outside the United States.
Management is required to make certain critical estimates related to the actuarial assumptions used
to determine our pension obligations and our net periodic pension cost or income. We believe the two
most critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan
assets. Our actuarial assumptions are reviewed annually, or more frequently to the extent that a
settlement or curtailment occurs. Changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on the
measurement of our pension obligations and our net periodic pension cost or income.
The discount rate assumption used to account for pension plans reflects the rate at which the benefit
obligations could be effectively settled. The discount rate for U.S. and certain non-U.S. plans is
determined using a matching technique whereby the rates of a yield curve, developed from high-quality
debt securities, are applied to projected benefit cash flows to determine the appropriate effective
discount rate. For other non-U.S. plans, we base the discount rate assumption on comparable indices
within each of the respective countries. The Company measures the service cost and interest cost
components of net periodic pension cost or income by applying the specific spot rates along the yield
curve to the plans’ projected cash flows.
The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based upon the long-term outlook of our
investment strategy as well as our historical returns and volatilities for each asset class. We also
review current levels of interest rates and inflation to assess the reasonableness of our expected
long-term rate of return on plan assets. Our investment objective for our pension assets is to ensure
all funded pension plans have sufficient assets to meet their benefit obligations when they become
due. As a result, the Company periodically revises asset allocations, where appropriate, to seek to
improve returns and manage risk.
In 2022, the Company’s net periodic pension income was $124 million. In 2023, we expect our net
periodic pension cost to be approximately $40 million. The primary driver of this change is the
unfavorable performance of plan assets in 2022, partially offset by the net impact of the increase in
the weighted-average discount rate at December 31, 2022 compared to December 31, 2021.
As of December 31, 2022, the U.S. qualified pension plan represented 64 percent and 61 percent of the
Company’s consolidated projected benefit obligation and pension plan assets, respectively. For this
plan, we estimate that a 50 basis-point decrease in the discount rate would result in a $13 million
increase in our 2023 net periodic pension cost, and we estimate that a 50 basis-point decrease in the
expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would result in a $21 million increase in our 2023
net periodic pension cost.
Refer to Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our
pension plans and related actuarial assumptions.
 Revenue Recognition 
Revenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of the contracts with our
customers are satisfied. Our performance obligation generally consists of the promise to sell
concentrates, syrups or finished products to our bottling partners, wholesalers, distributors or
retailers. Control of the concentrates, syrups or finished products is transferred upon shipment to,
or receipt at, our customers’ locations, as determined by the specific terms of the contract. Upon
transfer of control to the customer, which completes our performance obligation, revenue is
recognized. Our sales terms generally do not allow for a right of return except for matters related
to any manufacturing defects on our part. After completion of our performance obligation, we have an
unconditional right to consideration as outlined in the contract. Our receivables will generally be
collected in less than six months, in accordance with the underlying payment terms. All of our
performance obligations under the terms of contracts with our customers have an original duration of
one year or less.
Our customers and bottling partners may be entitled to cash discounts, funds for promotional and
marketing activities, volume‑based incentive programs, support for infrastructure programs, and other
similar programs. In most markets, in an effort to allow our Company and our bottling partners to
grow together through shared value, aligned financial objectives and the flexibility necessary to
meet consumers’ always changing needs and tastes, we have implemented an incidence-based concentrate
pricing model. Under this model, the concentrate price we charge is impacted by a number of factors,
including, but not limited to, bottler pricing, the channels in which the finished products produced
from the concentrates are sold, and package mix. The amounts associated with the arrangements
described above represent variable consideration, an estimate of which is included in the transaction
price as a component of net operating revenues in our consolidated statement of income upon
completion of our performance obligations. The total revenue recorded, including any variable
consideration, cannot exceed the amount for which it is probable that a significant reversal will not
occur when uncertainties related to variability are resolved. As a result, we are recognizing revenue
based on our faithful depiction of the consideration that we expect to receive. In making
 40 
our estimates of variable consideration, we consider past results and make significant assumptions
related to: (1) customer sales volumes; (2) customer ending inventories; (3) customer selling price
per unit; (4) selling channels; and (5) discount rates, rebates and other pricing allowances, as
applicable. In gathering data to estimate our variable consideration, we generally calculate our
estimates using a portfolio approach at the country and product line level rather than at the
individual contract level. The result of making these estimates will impact the line items trade
accounts receivable and accounts payable and accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheet. The
actual amounts ultimately paid and/or received may be different from our estimates.
 Income Taxes 
Our annual effective tax rate is based on our income and the tax laws in the various jurisdictions in
which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining our annual income tax expense and
in evaluating our tax positions. We establish reserves to remove some or all of the tax benefit of
any of our tax positions at the time we determine that the position becomes uncertain based upon one
of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is not “more likely than not” to be sustained; (2)
the tax position is “more likely than not” to be sustained, but for a lesser amount; or (3) the tax
position is “more likely than not” to be sustained, but not in the financial period in which the tax
position was originally taken. For purposes of evaluating whether or not a tax position is uncertain,
(1) we presume the tax position will be examined by the relevant taxing authority that has full
knowledge of all relevant information; (2) the technical merits of a tax position are derived from
authorities such as legislation and statutes, legislative intent, regulations, rulings and caselaw
and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position; and (3) each tax position
is evaluated without consideration of the possibility of offset or aggregation with other tax
positions taken. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and
penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit. Refer
to the heading “Operations Review — Income Taxes” below and Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.
A number of years may elapse before a particular uncertain tax position is audited and finally
resolved. The number of years subject to tax audits or tax assessments varies depending on the tax
jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the
“more likely than not” recognition threshold would be recognized in income tax expense in the first
interim period when the uncertainty disappears under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax
position is “more likely than not” to be sustained; (2) the tax position, amount and/or timing is
ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation; or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax
position has expired. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. Refer
to Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Tax laws require certain items to be included in the tax return at different times than when these
items are reflected in the consolidated financial statements. As a result, the annual effective tax
rate reflected in our consolidated financial statements is different from that reported in our tax
return (our cash tax rate). Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not
deductible in our tax return, and some differences reverse over time, such as depreciation expense.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the book
basis and tax basis of assets and liabilities. The tax rates used to determine deferred tax assets or
liabilities are the enacted tax rates in effect for the year and for the manner in which the
differences are expected to reverse. Based on the evaluation of all available information, the
Company recognizes future tax benefits, such as net operating loss carryforwards, to the extent that
realizing these benefits is considered more likely than not.
We evaluate our ability to realize the tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets by analyzing
our forecasted taxable income using both historical and projected future operating results; the
reversal of existing taxable temporary differences; taxable income in prior carryback years (if
permitted); and the availability of tax planning strategies. A valuation allowance is required to be
established unless management determines that it is more likely than not that the Company will
ultimately realize the tax benefit associated with a deferred tax asset.
The Company does not record a U.S. deferred tax liability for the excess of the book basis over the
tax basis of its investments in foreign subsidiaries to the extent that the basis difference meets
the indefinite reversal criteria. These criteria are met if the foreign subsidiary has invested, or
will invest, the undistributed earnings indefinitely. The decision as to the amount of undistributed
earnings that the Company intends to maintain in non-U.S. subsidiaries takes into account various
items, including, but not limited to, forecasts and budgets of financial needs of cash for working
capital, liquidity plans, capital improvement programs, merger and acquisition plans, and planned
loans to other non-U.S. subsidiaries. The Company also evaluates its expected cash requirements in
the United States. Other factors that can influence that determination are local restrictions on
remittances (for example, in some countries a central bank application and approval are required in
order for the Company’s local country subsidiary to pay a dividend), economic stability and asset
risk. Refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

 OPERATIONS REVIEW 
Our organizational structure consists of the following operating segments: Europe, Middle East and
Africa; Latin America; North America; Asia Pacific; Global Ventures; and Bottling Investments. Our
operating structure also includes Corporate, which consists of a center and a platform services
organization. For additional information regarding our operating segments and Corporate, refer to
Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and Newly Licensed Brands
In order to continually improve upon the Company’s operating performance, from time to time, we
engage in buying and selling ownership interests in bottling partners and other manufacturing
operations. In addition, we periodically acquire brands and their related operations or enter into
license agreements for certain brands to supplement our beverage offerings. These items impact our
operating results and certain key metrics used by management in assessing the Company’s performance.
Unit case volume growth is a key metric used by management to evaluate the Company’s performance
because it measures demand for our products at the consumer level. The Company’s unit case volume
represents the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of Company beverage products directly
or indirectly sold by the Company and its bottling partners to customers or consumers and, therefore,
reflects unit case volume for both consolidated and unconsolidated bottlers. Refer to the heading
“Beverage Volume” below.
Concentrate sales volume represents the amount of concentrates, syrups, source waters and
powders/minerals (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents) sold by, or used in finished
products sold by, the Company to its bottling partners or other customers. For Costa non-ready-to-
drink beverage products, concentrate sales volume represents the amount of beverages, primarily
measured in number of transactions (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents), sold by the
Company to customers or consumers. Refer to the heading “Beverage Volume” below.
When we analyze our net operating revenues, we generally consider the following factors: (1) volume
growth (concentrate sales volume or unit case volume, as applicable); (2) changes in price, product
and geographic mix; (3) foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; and (4) acquisitions and
divestitures (including structural changes as defined below), as applicable. Refer to the heading
“Net Operating Revenues” below. The Company sells concentrates and syrups to both consolidated and
unconsolidated bottling partners. The ownership structure of our bottling partners impacts the timing
of recognizing concentrate revenue and concentrate sales volume. When we sell concentrates or syrups
to our consolidated bottling partners, we do not recognize the concentrate revenue or concentrate
sales volume until the bottling partner has sold finished products manufactured from the concentrates
or syrups to a third party. When we sell concentrates or syrups to our unconsolidated bottling
partners, we recognize the concentrate revenue and concentrate sales volume when the concentrates or
syrups are sold to the bottling partner. The subsequent sale of the finished products manufactured
from the concentrates or syrups to a third party does not impact the timing of recognizing the
concentrate revenue or concentrate sales volume. When we account for an unconsolidated bottling
partner as an equity method investment, we eliminate the intercompany profit related to concentrate
sales to the extent of our ownership interest, until the equity method investee has sold finished
products manufactured from the concentrates or syrups to a third party. We typically report unit case
volume when finished products manufactured from the concentrates or syrups are sold to a third party,
regardless of our ownership interest in the bottling partner, if any.
We generally refer to acquisitions and divestitures of bottling operations as “structural changes,”
which are a component of acquisitions and divestitures. Typically, structural changes do not impact
the Company’s unit case volume or concentrate sales volume on a consolidated basis or at the
geographic operating segment level. We recognize unit case volume for all sales of Company beverage
products, regardless of our ownership interest in the bottling partner, if any. However, the unit
case volume reported by our Bottling Investments operating segment is generally impacted by
structural changes because it only includes the unit case volume of our consolidated bottling
operations. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information
on the Company’s acquisitions and divestitures.
“Acquired brands” refers to brands acquired during the past 12 months. Typically, the Company has not
reported unit case volume or recognized concentrate sales volume related to acquired brands in
periods prior to the closing of a transaction. Therefore, the unit case volume and concentrate sales
volume related to an acquired brand are incremental to prior year volume. We generally do not
consider the acquisition of a brand to be a structural change.
“Licensed brands” refers to brands not owned by the Company but for which we hold certain rights,
generally including, but not limited to, distribution rights, and from which we derive an economic
benefit when the related products are sold. Typically, the Company has not reported unit case volume
or recognized concentrate sales volume related to a licensed brand in periods prior to the beginning
of the term of a license agreement. Therefore, in the year that a license agreement is entered into,
the unit case volume and concentrate sales volume related to a licensed brand are incremental to
prior year volume. We generally do not consider the licensing of a brand to be a structural change.

In August 2022, the Company acquired a controlling interest in a bottling operation in Malawi. The
impact of this acquisition has been included as a structural change in our analysis of net operating
revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for the Bottling Investments and Europe, Middle East and
Africa operating segments. Additionally, in November 2022, the Company refranchised our bottling
operations in Cambodia. The impact of this refranchising has been included as a structural change in
our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for the Bottling
Investments and Asia Pacific operating segments.
In November 2021, the Company acquired the remaining ownership interest in BA Sports Nutrition, LLC
(“BodyArmor”). The impact of this acquisition has been included in acquisitions and divestitures in
our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for the North America
operating segment.
 Beverage Volume 
We measure the volume of Company beverage products sold in two ways: (1) unit cases of finished
products and (2) concentrate sales. As used in this report, “unit case” means a unit of measurement
equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings), with the exception of
unit case equivalents for Costa non-ready-to-drink beverage products, which are primarily measured in
number of transactions; and “unit case volume” means the number of unit cases (or unit case
equivalents) of Company beverage products directly or indirectly sold by the Company and its bottling
partners to customers or consumers. Unit case volume consists primarily of beverage products bearing
Company trademarks. Also included in unit case volume are certain brands licensed to, or distributed
by, our Company, and brands owned by Coca-Cola system bottlers for which our Company provides
marketing support and from the sale of which we derive an economic benefit. In addition, unit case
volume includes sales by certain joint ventures in which the Company has an ownership interest. We
believe unit case volume is one of the indicators of the underlying strength of the Coca-Cola system
because it measures demand for our products at the consumer level. The unit case volume numbers used
in this report are derived based on estimates received by the Company from its bottling partners and
distributors. Concentrate sales volume represents the amount of concentrates, syrups, source waters
and powders/minerals (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents) sold by, or used in
finished beverages sold by, the Company to its bottling partners or other customers. For Costa non-
ready-to-drink beverage products, concentrate sales volume represents the amount of beverages,
primarily measured in number of transactions (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents),
sold by the Company to customers or consumers. Unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth
rates are not necessarily equal during any given period. Factors such as seasonality, bottlers’
inventory practices, supply point changes, timing of price increases, new product introductions and
changes in product mix can create differences between unit case volume and concentrate sales volume
growth rates. In addition to these items, the impact of unit case volume from certain joint ventures
in which the Company has an ownership interest, but to which the Company does not sell concentrates,
syrups, source waters or powders/minerals, may give rise to differences between unit case volume and
concentrate sales volume growth rates.

 Unit Case Volume 
The Coca-Cola system sold 32.7 billion and 31.3 billion unit cases of our products in 2022 and 2021,
respectively. The increase was primarily a result of strength in away-from-home channels and ongoing
investments in the marketplace.
Unit case volume in Europe, Middle East and Africa increased 3 percent, which included 4 percent
growth in Trademark Coca-Cola, 6 percent growth in water, sports, coffee and tea, and 2 percent
growth in sparkling flavors, partially offset by a 13 percent decline in juice, value-added dairy and
plant-based beverages. The operating segment reported growth in unit case volume of 8 percent in the
Eurasia and Middle East operating unit and 1 percent in the Europe operating unit. Unit case volume
in the Africa operating unit was even. The growth in the Europe operating unit included the impact of
the suspension of the Company’s business in Russia. The performance in the Africa operating unit
included the impact of transitioning certain territories to new franchise bottling partners.
In Latin America, unit case volume increased 6 percent, which included 5 percent growth in Trademark
Coca-Cola, 10 percent growth in water, sports, coffee and tea, 6 percent growth in sparkling flavors
and 10 percent growth in juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages. The operating segment’s
volume performance included 5 percent growth in Mexico, 9 percent growth in Brazil and 11 percent
growth in Argentina.
Unit case volume in North America increased 2 percent, which included 1 percent growth in Trademark
Coca-Cola, 3 percent growth in both sparkling flavors and juice, value-added dairy and plant-based
beverages, and even performance in water, sports, coffee and tea.
In Asia Pacific, unit case volume increased 6 percent, which included 8 percent growth in sparkling
flavors, 6 percent growth in Trademark Coca-Cola, 4 percent growth in water, sports, coffee and tea,
and 9 percent growth in juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages. The operating segment
reported growth in unit case volume of 36 percent in the India and Southwest Asia operating unit, 6
percent in the ASEAN and South Pacific operating unit, and 2 percent in the Japan and South Korea
operating unit, partially offset by a decline of 3 percent in the Greater China and Mongolia
operating unit.
Unit case volume for Global Ventures increased 13 percent, driven by 12 percent growth in water,
sports, coffee and tea along with growth in energy drinks, partially offset by a decline of 3 percent
in juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages.
Unit case volume for Bottling Investments increased 12 percent, which primarily reflects growth in
India, South Africa and Vietnam.
 Concentrate Sales Volume 
In 2022, worldwide concentrate sales volume and unit case volume both grew 5 percent compared to
2021. The differences between concentrate sales volume and unit case volume growth rates for the
operating segments were primarily due to the timing of concentrate shipments and the impact of unit
case volume from certain joint ventures in which the Company has an ownership interest, but to which
the Company does not sell concentrates, syrups, source waters or powders/minerals.

 Net Operating Revenues 
Net operating revenues were $43,004 million in 2022, compared to $38,655 million in 2021, an increase
of $4,349 million, or 11 percent.
The following table illustrates, on a percentage basis, the estimated impact of the factors resulting

1 Represents the percent change in net operating revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in
concentrate sales volume for our geographic operating segments and our Global Ventures operating
segment (expressed in unit case equivalents) after considering the impact of acquisitions and
divestitures, if any. For our Bottling Investments operating segment, this represents the percent
change in net operating revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in unit case volume after
considering the impact of structural changes, if any. Our Bottling Investments operating segment data
reflects unit case volume growth for consolidated bottlers only after considering the impact of
structural changes, if any. Refer to the heading “Beverage Volume” above.
2 Includes structural changes, if any. Refer to the heading “Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and
Newly Licensed Brands” above.
Refer to the heading “Beverage Volume” above for additional information related to changes in our
unit case and concentrate sales volumes.
“Price, product and geographic mix” refers to the change in net operating revenues caused by factors
such as price changes, the mix of products and packages sold, and the mix of channels and geographic
territories where the sales occurred. The impact of price, product and geographic mix is calculated
by subtracting the change in net operating revenues resulting from volume increases or decreases,
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, and acquisitions and divestitures from the total
change in net operating revenues. Management believes that providing investors with price, product
and geographic mix enhances their understanding about the combined impact that the following items
had on the Company’s net operating revenues: (1) pricing actions taken by the Company and, where
applicable, our bottling partners; (2) changes in the mix of products and packages sold; (3) changes
in the mix of channels where products were sold; and (4) changes in the mix of geographic territories
where products were sold. Management uses this measure in making financial, operating and planning
decisions and in evaluating the Company’s performance.
Price, product and geographic m ix had an 11 percent favorable impact on our consolidated net
operating revenues. Price, product and geographic mix was impacted by a variety of factors and
events, including, but not limited to, the following:
• Europe, Middle East and Africa — favorable pricing initiatives, including inflationary pricing in
Türkiye, partially offset by unfavorable geographic mix;
• Latin America — favorable pricing initiatives, including inflationary pricing in Argentina, along
with favorable channel and package mix;
• North America — favorable pricing initiatives, including a benefit resulting from the timing of
price increases in the prior year, and favorable channel, package and product mix;
• Asia Pacific — favorable pricing initiatives along with favorable channel and package mix,
partially offset by unfavorable geographic mix;
• Global Ventures — favorable pricing initiatives and favorable channel mix, primarily due to the
timing of Costa retail store reopenings in the United Kingdom in the prior year, offset by the
unfavorable impact of no longer receiving COVID-related incentives in the current year; and
• Bottling Investments — favorable pricing initiatives across most markets, partially offset by
unfavorable geographic mix.
 45 
The favorable channel and package mix for the year ended December 31, 2022 in all applicable
operating segments was primarily a result of strength in away-from-home channels in the current year
and the impact of social distancing measures in the prior year.
Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates decreased our consolidated net operating revenues by
7 percent. This unfavorable impact was primarily due to a stronger U.S. dollar compared to certain
foreign currencies, including the Japanese yen, Turkish lira, euro, British pound sterling,
Philippine peso, South African rand and Argentine peso, which had an unfavorable impact on our Asia
Pacific; Europe, Middle East and Africa; Global Ventures; Bottling Investments; and Latin America
operating segments. The unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar compared to the currencies
listed above was partially offset by the impact of a weaker U.S. dollar compared to certain other
foreign currencies, including the Brazilian real and Mexican peso, which had a favorable impact on
our Latin America operating segment. Refer to the heading “Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial
Position — Foreign Exchange” below for additional information about the impact of foreign currency
exchange rate fluctuations.
“Acquisitions and divestitures” generally refers to acquisitions and divestitures of brands or
businesses, some of which the Company considers to be structural changes. The impact of acquisitions
and divestitures is the difference between the change in net operating revenues and the change in
what our net operating revenues would have been if we removed the net operating revenues associated
with an acquisition or a divestiture from either the current year or the prior year, as applicable.
Management believes that quantifying the impact that acquisitions and divestitures had on the
Company’s net operating revenues provides investors with useful information to enhance their
understanding of the Company’s net operating revenue performance by improving their ability to
compare our year-to-year results. Management considers the impact of acquisitions and divestitures
when evaluating the Company’s performance. Refer to the heading “Structural Changes, Acquired Brands
and Newly Licensed Brands” above for additional information related to acquisitions and divestitures.
Net operating revenue growth rates are impacted by sales volume; price, product and geographic mix;
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; and acquisitions and divestitures. The size and timing
of acquisitions and divestitures are not consistent from period to period. Based on current spot
rates and our hedging coverage in place, we expect foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will
have an unfavorable impact on our full year 2023 net operating revenues.
Information about our net operating revenues by operating segment and Corporate as a percentage of
Company net operating revenues is as follows:
 Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 
 ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── 
 Europe, Middle East & Africa 16.0 % 17.0 % 
 Latin America 11.4 10.7 
 North America 36.5 34.1 
 Asia Pacific 11.0 12.1 
 Global Ventures 6.6 7.3 
 Bottling Investments 18.3 18.6 
 Corporate 0.2 0.2 
 Total 100.0 % 100.0 % 
The percentage contribution of each operating segment fluctuates over time due to net operating
revenues in some operating segments growing at a faster rate compared to other operating segments. In
addition, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations impact the percentage contribution of each
operating segment. For additional information about the impact of foreign currency exchange rate
fluctuations, refer to the heading “Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position — Foreign
Exchange” below.
 Gross Profit Margin 
Gross profit margin is a ratio calculated by dividing gross profit by net operating revenues.
Management believes gross profit margin provides investors with useful information related to the
profitability of our business prior to considering all of the selling, general and administrative
expenses and other operating charges incurred. Management uses this measure in making financial,
operating and planning decisions and in evaluating the Company’s performance.
 46 
Our gross profit margin decreased to 58.1 percent in 2022 from 60.3 percent in 2021. This decrease
was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, increased
commodity and transportation costs, and the acquisition of BodyArmor, a finished goods business, in
November 2021. The impact of these items was partially offset by favorable pricing initiatives as
well as favorable channel and package mix. We expect commodity and transportation costs to continue
to have an unfavorable impact on our gross profit margin in 2023, and we will continue to proactively
take actions in an effort to mitigate the impact of these incremental costs.
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
The following table sets forth the components of selling, general and administrative expenses (in
millions):
 Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 
 ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── 
 Selling and distribution expenses $ 2,767 $ 2,574 
 Advertising expenses 4,319 4,098 
 Stock-based compensation expense 356 337 
 Other operating expenses 5,438 5,135 
 Selling, general and administrative $ 12,880 $ 12,144 
 expenses 
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $736 million, or 6 percent, in 2022. This
increase was primarily due to increased marketing spending, higher selling and distribution expenses,
and higher annual incentive and stock-based compensation expense. The increase in selling and
distribution expenses was due to the continued recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase in
stock-based compensation expense was primarily due to our strong financial performance in 2022 and a
more favorable outlook of our future financial performance, which resulted in higher payout
assumptions as compared to 2021. In 2022, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations decreased
selling, general and administrative expenses by 6 percent.
As of December 31, 2022, we had $325 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to
nonvested stock-based compensation awards granted under our plans, which we expect to recognize over
a weighted-average period of 1.9 years as stock-based compensation expense. This expected cost does
not include the impact of any future stock-based compensation awards. Refer to Note 12 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.
 Other Operating Charges 
Other operating charges incurred by operating segment and Corporate were as follows (in millions):
 Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021

 Global Ventures — — 
 Bottling Investments — — 
 Corporate 1,146 643 
 Total $ 1,215 $ 846 
In 2022, the Company recorded other operating charges of $1,215 million. These charges primarily
consisted of $1,000 million related to the remeasurement of our contingent consideration liability to
fair value in conjunction with our acquisition of fairlife, LLC ("fairlife") in 2020, $85 million
related to the Company’s productivity and reinvestment program and $57 million related to the
impairment of a trademark in Asia Pacific. In addition, other operating charges included $38 million
related to the restructuring of our North America operating unit and $38 million related to the
BodyArmor acquisition in 2021, which included various transition and transaction costs, employee
retention costs and the amortization of noncompete agreements, net of the reimbursement of
distributor termination fees recorded in 2021. These charges were partially offset by a net gain of
$6 million due to revisions of management’s estimates related to the Company’s strategic realignment
initiatives.
In 2021, the Company recorded other operating charges of $846 million. These charges primarily
consisted of $369 million related to the remeasurement of our contingent consideration liability to
fair value in conjunction with the fairlife acquisition, $146 million related to the Company’s
strategic realignment initiatives, $119 million related to the BodyArmor acquisition, which includes
various transition and transaction costs, distributor termination fees, employee retention costs and
the amortization of noncompete agreements, and $115 million related to the Company’s productivity and
reinvestment program. In
 47 
addition, other operating charges included an impairment charge of $78 million related to a trademark
in Europe, which was driven by a change in the long-term outlook on the licensing arrangement for a
certain brand, charges of $15 million related to tax litigation and a net charge of $4 million
related to the restructuring of our manufacturing operations in the United States.
Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the
BodyArmor and fairlife acquisitions. Refer to Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
for additional information related to the tax litigation. Refer to Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information on the impairment charges. Refer to Note 18 of Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Company’s restructuring
initiatives. Refer to Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the impact these
charges had on our operating segments and Corporate.

Operating income was $10,909 million in 2022, compared to $10,308 million in 2021, an increase of
$601 million, or 6 percent. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by concentrate
sales volume growth of 5 percent, favorable channel and package mix, and favorable pricing
initiatives, partially offset by higher other operating charges; increased marketing spending; and an
unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact.
The decrease in our operating margin on a consolidated basis was primarily due to the unfavorable
impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, increased commodity and transportation costs,
increased marketing spending, and the acquisition of BodyArmor, a finished goods business, in
November 2021. The impact of these items was partially offset by favorable pricing initiatives as
well as favorable channel and package mix.
In 2022, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates unfavorably impacted consolidated operating
income by 9 percent due to a stronger U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies, including
the Japanese yen, Turkish lira, euro, Argentine peso, and British pound sterling, which had an
unfavorable impact on our Asia Pacific; Europe, Middle East and Africa; Latin America; and Global
Ventures operating segments. The unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar compared to the
currencies listed above was partially offset by the impact of a weaker U.S. dollar compared to
certain other foreign currencies, including
 48 
the Mexican peso and Brazilian real, which had a favorable impact on our Latin America operating
segment. Refer to the heading “Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position — Foreign
Exchange” below.
The Company’s Europe, Middle East and Africa operating segment reported operating income of $3,958
million and $3,735 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase
in operating income was primarily driven by a 2 percent increase in concentrate sales volume,
favorable pricing initiatives, favorable channel and package mix, and lower other operating charges,
partially offset by an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact of 17 percent, higher
commodity costs, increased operating expenses and increased marketing spending.
Latin America reported operating income of $2,870 million and $2,534 million for the years ended
December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by
concentrate sales volume growth of 7 percent, favorable pricing initiatives, favorable channel and
package mix, and lower other operating charges, partially offset by an unfavorable foreign currency
exchange rate impact of 6 percent, higher commodity costs and increased marketing spending.
Operating income for North America for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $3,742 million
and $3,331 million, respectively. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by
concentrate sales volume growth of 1 percent, favorable pricing initiatives, favorable channel and
category mix and lower other operating charges, partially offset by increased marketing spending and
increased operating expenses.
Asia Pacific’s operating income for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $2,303 million and
$2,325 million, respectively. The decrease in operating income was primarily driven by an unfavorable
foreign currency exchange rate impact of 8 percent, increased marketing spending, increased operating
expenses and higher other operating charges, partially offset by concentrate sales volume growth of 8
percent, favorable pricing initiatives, and favorable channel and package mix.
Global Ventures’ operating income for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $185 million and
$293 million, respectively. The decrease in operating income was primarily driven by the impact of no
longer receiving COVID-related incentives in the current year, higher commodity costs, higher selling
and distribution expenses, and an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact of 2 percent,
partially offset by concentrate sales volume growth of 13 percent.
Bottling Investments’ operating income for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $487
million and $473 million, respectively. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by unit
case volume growth of 12 percent and favorable pricing initiatives, partially offset by an
unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact of 9 percent and higher selling and distribution
expenses.
Corporate’s operating loss for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $2,636 million and
$2,383 million, respectively. Operating loss in 2022 increased primarily as a result of higher other
operating charges due to the remeasurement of our contingent consideration liability to fair value in
conjunction with the fairlife acquisition and increased marketing spending.
 Interest Income 
Interest income was $449 million in 2022, compared to $276 million in 2021, an increase of $173
million, or 62 percent. This increase was primarily driven by higher returns in certain of our
international locations.
 Interest Expense 
Interest expense was $882 million in 2022, compared to $1,597 million in 2021, a decrease of $715
million, or 45 percent. This decrease was primarily due to charges in 2021 of $650 million associated
with the extinguishment of long-term debt and certain hedging activities that occurred during 2021,
partially offset by the impact of higher interest rates in 2022. Refer to Note 10 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.
 Equity Income (Loss) — Net 
Equity income (loss) — net represents our Company’s proportionate share of net income or loss from
each of our equity method investees. In 2022, equity income was $1,472 million, compared to equity
income of $1,438 million in 2021, an increase of $34 million, or 2 percent. The increase was
primarily due to more favorable operating results reported by several of our equity method investees
in the current year, partially offset by an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact and the
sale of all or a portion of our ownership interest in certain equity method investees. In addition,
the Company recorded net charges of $34 million and $13 million during the years ended December 31,
2022 and 2021, respectively, which represent the Company’s proportionate share of significant
operating and nonoperating items recorded by certain of our equity method investees.
 49 
 Other Income (Loss) — Net 
Other income (loss) — net includes, among other things, dividend income; gains and losses related to
the disposal of property, plant and equipment; gains and losses related to acquisitions and
divestitures; non-service cost components of net periodic benefit cost or income for pension and
other postretirement benefit plans; other charges and credits related to pension and other
postretirement benefit plans; realized and unrealized gains and losses on equity securities and
trading debt securities; realized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities; other-than-
temporary impairment charges; and net foreign currency exchange gains and losses. Foreign currency
exchange gains and losses are primarily the result of the remeasurement of monetary assets and
liabilities from certain currencies into functional currencies. The effects of the remeasurement of
these assets and liabilities are partially offset by the impact of our economic hedging program for
certain exposures on our consolidated balance sheet. Refer to Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.
In 2022, other income (loss) — net was a loss of $262 million. The Company recorded a net loss of
$371 million related to realized and unrealized gains and losses on equity securities and trading
debt securities as well as realized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities, net
foreign currency exchange losses of $236 million, an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $96
million related to an equity method investee in Russia, and a net loss of $24 million as a result of
one of our equity method investees issuing additional shares of its stock. Additionally, other income
(loss) — net included net income of $219 million related to the non-service cost components of net
periodic benefit income, a net gain of $153 million related to the refranchising of our bottling
operations in Cambodia and dividend income of $111 million.
In 2021, other income (loss) — net was income of $2,000 million. The Company recognized a gain of
$834 million in conjunction with the BodyArmor acquisition; a net gain of $695 million related to the
sale of our ownership interest in Coca-Cola Amatil Limited (“CCA”), an equity method investee, to
CCEP, also an equity method investee; and a net gain of $114 million related to the sale of our
ownership interest in an equity method investee and the sale of a portion of our ownership interest
in another equity method investee. Additionally, the Company recognized a net gain of $467 million
related to realized and unrealized gains and losses on equity securities and trading debt securities
as well as realized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities. Other income (loss) — net
also included $277 million related to the non-service cost components of net periodic benefit income,
dividend income of $73 million, charges of $266 million related to the restructuring of our
manufacturing operations in the United States, pension plan settlement charges of $117 million
related to our strategic realignment initiatives and net foreign currency exchange losses of $61
million.
Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the
acquisition of BodyArmor, the sale of our ownership interest in CCA and the refranchising of our
bottling operations in Cambodia. Refer to Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information on equity and debt securities. Refer to Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information on the restructuring of our manufacturing operations
in the United States and the impairment charges. Refer to Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information on the Company’s strategic realignment initiatives. Refer to
Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the impact these items had on our operating
segments and Corporate.
 Income Taxes 
Our effective tax rate reflects the tax benefits of having significant operations outside the United
States, which are generally taxed at rates lower than the statutory U.S. federal tax rate. As a
result of employment actions and capital investments made by the Company, certain tax jurisdictions
provide income tax incentive grants, including Brazil, Costa Rica, Singapore and Eswatini. The terms
of these grants expire from 2025 to 2036. We anticipate that we will be able to extend or renew the
grants in these locations. Tax incentive grants favorably impacted our income tax expense by $406
million and $381 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. In addition,
our effective tax rate reflects the benefits of having significant earnings generated in investments
accounted for under the equity method.

A reconciliation of the statutory U.S. federal tax rate and our effective tax rate is as follows:

1 Includes net tax charges of $375 million (or a 3.0 percent impact on our effective tax rate)
related to changes in tax laws in certain foreign jurisdictions, amounts required to be recorded for
changes to our uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties, in various international
jurisdictions, as well as other discrete items.
2 Includes a tax benefit of $14 million (or a 1.5 percent impact on our effective tax rate)
associated with the $834 million gain recorded upon the acquisition of the remaining ownership
interest in BodyArmor. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
On November 18, 2020, the Tax Court issued the Opinion regarding the Company’s 2015 litigation with
the IRS involving transfer pricing tax adjustments in which the court predominantly sided with the
IRS. The Company disagrees with the Opinion and intends to vigorously defend its position. Refer to
Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
As of December 31, 2022, the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $926 million. If the
Company were to prevail on all uncertain tax positions, the net effect would be a benefit of $617
million, exclusive of any benefits related to interest and penalties. The remaining $309 million
primarily represents tax benefits that would be received in different tax jurisdictions in the event
the Company did not prevail on all uncertain tax positions.
A reconciliation of the changes in the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in
millions):
 Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 
 ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── 
 Balance of unrecognized tax benefits at $ 906 $ 915

 Effect of foreign currency translation -22 -1 
 Balance of unrecognized tax benefits at $ 926 $ 906 
 end of year 
The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the line item
income taxes in our consolidated statement of income. The Company had $496 million and $453 million
in interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits accrued as of December 31, 2022 and
2021, respectively. Of these amounts, expense of $43 million and $62 million was recognized in 2022
and 2021, respectively. If the Company were to prevail on all uncertain tax positions, the reversal
of this accrual would be a benefit to the Company’s effective tax rate.
Based on current tax laws, the Company’s effective tax rate in 2023 is expected to be approximately
19.5 percent before considering the potential impact of any significant operating and nonoperating
items that may affect our effective tax rate.
 LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES AND FINANCIAL POSITION 
We believe our ability to generate cash flows from operating activities is one of the fundamental
strengths of our business. Refer to the heading “Cash Flows from Operating Activities” below. The
Company does not typically raise capital through the issuance of stock. Instead, we use debt
financing to lower our overall cost of capital and increase our return on shareowners’ equity. Refer
to the heading “Cash Flows from Financing Activities” below. We have a history of borrowing funds
both domestically and internationally at reasonable interest rates, and we expect to be able to
continue to borrow funds at reasonable rates over the long term. Our debt financing also includes the
use of a commercial paper program. We currently have the ability to borrow funds in this market at
levels that are consistent with our debt financing strategy, and we expect to continue to be able to
do so in the future. The Company regularly reviews its optimal mix of short-term and long-term debt.
 51 
The Company’s cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and marketable securities totaled $11.6
billion as of December 31, 2022. In addition to these funds, our commercial paper program and our
ability to issue long-term debt, we had $4.4 billion in unused backup lines of credit for general
corporate purposes as of December 31, 2022. These backup lines of credit expire at various times from
2023 through 2028.
Our current capital allocation priorities are as follows: investing wisely to support our business
operations, continuing to grow our dividend payment, enhancing our beverage portfolio and
capabilities through consumer-centric acquisitions, and using excess cash to repurchase shares over
time. We currently expect 2023 capital expenditures to be approximately $1.9 billion. During 2023, we
also expect to repurchase shares to offset dilution resulting from employee stock-based compensation
plans.
We are currently in litigation with the IRS for tax years 2007 through 2009. On November 18, 2020,
the Tax Court issued the Opinion in which it predominantly sided with the IRS; however, a final
decision is still pending and the timing of such decision is not currently known. The Company
strongly disagrees with the IRS’ positions and the portions of the Opinion affirming such positions
and intends to vigorously defend our positions utilizing every available avenue of appeal. While the
Company believes that it is more likely than not that we will ultimately prevail in this litigation
upon appeal, it is possible that all, or some portion of, the adjustments proposed by the IRS and
sustained by the Tax Court could ultimately be upheld. In the event that all of the adjustments
proposed by the IRS were ultimately upheld for tax years 2007 through 2009 and the IRS, with the
consent of the federal courts, were to decide to apply the Tax Court Methodology to the subsequent
years up to and including 2022, the Company currently estimates that the potential aggregate
incremental tax and interest liability could be approximately $14 billion as of December 31, 2022.
Additional income tax and interest would continue to accrue until the time any such potential
liability, or portion thereof, were to be paid. Once the Tax Court renders a final decision, the
Company will have 90 days to file a notice of appeal and pay the portion of the potential aggregate
incremental tax and interest liability related to the 2007 through 2009 tax years, which we currently
estimate to be approximately $5.2 billion (including interest accrued through December 31, 2022),
plus any additional interest accrued through the time of payment. Refer to Note 11 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the tax litigation.
While we believe it is more likely than not that we will prevail in the tax litigation discussed
above, we are confident that, between our ability to generate cash flows from operating activities
and our ability to borrow funds at reasonable interest rates, we can manage the range of possible
outcomes in the final resolution of the matter.
Based on all of the aforementioned factors, the Company believes its current liquidity position is
strong and will continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for
investing and financing activities for the foreseeable future.
 Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
As part of our continued efforts to improve our working capital efficiency, we have worked with our
suppliers over the past several years to revisit terms and conditions, including the extension of
payment terms. Our current payment terms with the majority of our suppliers are 120 days.
Additionally, two global financial institutions offer a voluntary supply chain finance (“SCF”)
program which enables our suppliers, at their sole discretion, to sell their receivables from the
Company to these financial institutions on a non-recourse basis at a rate that leverages our credit
rating and thus may be more beneficial to them. The SCF program is available to suppliers of goods
and services included in cost of goods sold as well as suppliers of goods and services included in
selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of income. The Company and
our suppliers agree on contractual terms for the goods and services we procure, including prices,
quantities and payment terms, regardless of whether the supplier elects to participate in the SCF
program. The suppliers sell goods or services, as applicable, to the Company and issue the associated
invoices to the Company based on the agreed-upon contractual terms. Then, if they are participating
in the SCF program, our suppliers, at their sole discretion, determine which invoices, if any, they
want to sell to the financial institutions. Our suppliers’ voluntary inclusion of invoices in the SCF
program has no bearing on our payment terms. No guarantees are provided by the Company or any of our
subsidiaries under the SCF program. We have no economic interest in a supplier’s decision to
participate in the SCF program, and we have no direct financial relationship with the financial
institutions, as it relates to the SCF program. Accordingly, amounts due to our suppliers that
elected to participate in the SCF program are included in the line item accounts payable and accrued
expenses in our consolidated balance sheet. All activity related to amounts due to suppliers that
elected to participate in the SCF program is reflected within the operating activities section of our
consolidated statement of cash flows. We have been informed by the financial institutions that as of
December 31, 2022 and 2021, suppliers had elected to sell $1,234 million and $882 million,
respectively, of our outstanding payment obligations to the financial institutions. The amounts
settled through the SCF program were $4,724 million and $3,237 million during the years ended
December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We do not believe there is a risk that our payment terms
will be shortened in the near future.
 52 
The Company has a trade accounts receivable factoring program in certain countries. Under this
program, we can elect to sell trade accounts receivables to unaffiliated financial institutions at a
discount. In these factoring arrangements, for ease of administration, the Company collects customer
payments related to the factored receivables and remits those payments to the financial institutions.
The Company sold $10,709 million and $6,266 million of trade accounts receivables under this program
during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The costs of factoring such
receivables were $27 million and $5 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021,
respectively. The cash received from the financial institutions is classified within the operating
activities section in our consolidated statement of cash flows.
Net cash provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $11,018
million and $12,625 million, respectively, a decrease of $1,607 million, or 13 percent. This decrease
was primarily driven by higher marketing payments resulting from 2021 year-end accruals, an
unfavorable impact due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, the buildup of inventory to
manage potential supply chain disruptions, and higher annual incentive and tax payments in 2022.
These items were partially offset by increased operating income, lower payments related to our
strategic realignment initiatives, and increased benefits from the extension of certain vendor
payment terms and our trade accounts receivable factoring program.
 Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
Net cash used in investing activities was $763 million and $2,765 million in 2022 and 2021,
respectively.
Purchases of Investments and Proceeds from Disposals of Investments
In 2022, purchases of investments were $3,751 million and proceeds from disposals of investments were
$4,771 million, resulting in a net cash inflow of $1,020 million. In 2021, purchases of investments
were $6,030 million and proceeds from disposals of investments were $7,059 million, resulting in a
net cash inflow of $1,029 million. This activity primarily represents the purchases of, and proceeds
from the disposals of, investments in marketable securities and short-term investments that were made
as part of the Company’s overall cash management strategy. Also included in this activity are
purchases of, and proceeds from the disposals of, investments held by our captive insurance
companies.
Acquisitions of Businesses, Equity Method Investments and Nonmarketable Securities
In 2022, the Company’s acquisitions of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable
securities totaled $73 million.
In 2021, the Company’s acquisitions of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable
securities totaled $4,766 million, which primarily related to the acquisition of the remaining
ownership interest in BodyArmor.
Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to
our acquisitions.
Proceeds from Disposals of Businesses, Equity Method Investments and Nonmarketable Securities
In 2022, proceeds from disposals of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable
securities totaled $458 million, which primarily related to the refranchising of our bottling
operations in Cambodia and the sale of our ownership interest in one of our equity method
investments.
In 2021, proceeds from disposals of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable
securities totaled $2,180 million, which primarily related to the sale of our ownership interest in
CCA, an equity method investee, to CCEP, also an equity method investee.
Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to
our disposals.
Purchases of Property, Plant and Equipment
Purchases of property, plant and equipment during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were
$1,484 million and $1,367 million, respectively.
 53 
Total capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment and the percentage of such totals by
operating segment and Corporate were as follows (in millions):
 Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 
 ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── 
 Capital expenditures $ 1,484 $ 1,367 
 Europe, Middle East & Africa 3.3 % 2.6 %

 Corporate 17.0 14.0 
Collateral (Paid) Received Associated with Hedging Activities — Net
Collateral paid associated with our hedging activities during the year ended December 31, 2022 was
$1,465 million. Refer to Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information on our hedging activities.
Other Investing Activities
During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the total cash inflow for other investing
activities was $706 million and $51 million, respectively. The activities during 2022 included cash
proceeds of $823 million received in advance of the refranchising of our bottling operations in
Vietnam. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on
this transaction.
 Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
Net cash used in financing activities was $10,250 million and $6,786 million in 2022 and 2021,
respectively.
Debt Financing
Our Company maintains debt levels we consider prudent based on our cash flows, interest coverage
ratio and percentage of debt to capital. We use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital,
which increases our return on shareowners’ equity. This exposes us to adverse changes in interest
rates. Our interest expense may also be affected by our credit ratings.
As of December 31, 2022, our long-term debt was rated “A+” by Standard & Poor’s and “A1” by Moody’s.
Our commercial paper program was rated “A-1” by Standard & Poor’s and “P-1” by Moody’s. In assessing
our credit strength, both rating agencies consider our capital structure (including the amount and
maturity dates of our debt) and financial policies as well as the consolidated balance sheet and
other financial information of the Company. In addition, certain rating agencies also consider the
financial information of certain bottlers, including CCEP, Coca-Cola Consolidated, Inc., Coca-Cola
FEMSA and Coca-Cola Hellenic. While the Company has no legal obligation for the debt of these
bottlers, the rating agencies believe the strategic importance of the bottlers to the Company’s
business model provides the Company with an incentive to keep these bottlers viable. It is our
expectation that these rating agencies will continue using this methodology. If our credit ratings
were to be downgraded as a result of changes in our capital structure, our major bottlers’ financial
performance, changes in the credit rating agencies’ methodology in assessing our credit strength, or
for any other reason, our cost of borrowing could increase. Additionally, if certain bottlers’ credit
ratings were to decline, the Company’s equity income could be reduced as a result of the potential
increase in interest expense for those bottlers.
We monitor our financial ratios and, as indicated above, the rating agencies consider these ratios in
assessing our credit ratings. Each rating agency employs a different aggregation methodology and has
different thresholds for the various financial ratios. These thresholds are not necessarily
permanent, nor are they always fully disclosed to our Company.
Our global presence and strong capital position give us access to key financial markets around the
world, enabling us to borrow funds at a low effective cost. This posture, coupled with active
management of our mix of short-term and long-term debt as well as our mix of fixed-rate and variable-
rate debt, results in a lower overall cost of borrowing. Our debt management policies, in conjunction
with our share repurchase program and investment activity, can result in current liabilities
exceeding current assets.
Issuances and payments of debt included both short-term and long-term financing activities. During
2022, the Company had issuances of debt of $3,972 million, which included $2,321 million of issuances
of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities greater than 90 days, $798 million of net
issuances of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities of 90 days or less, and long-term
debt issuances of $853 million, net of related discounts and issuance costs.
 54 
During 2022, the Company made payments of debt of $4,930 million, which consisted of $3,623 million
of payments related to commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities greater than 90 days and
payments of long-term debt of $1,307 million.
During 2021, the Company had issuances of debt of $13,094 million, which included $3,391 million of
issuances of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities greater than 90 days, $80 million
of net issuances of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities of 90 days or less, and
long-term debt issuances of $9,623 million, net of related discounts and issuance costs.
During 2021, the Company made payments of debt of $12,866 million, which consisted of $2,357 million
of payments related to commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities greater than 90 days and
payments of long-term debt of $10,509 million.
On December 31, 2021, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority, the governing body
responsible for regulating LIBOR, ceased to publish certain LIBOR reference rates. However, other
LIBOR reference rates, including U.S. dollar overnight, 1-month, 3-month, 6-month and 12-month
maturities, will continue to be published through June 2023. In preparation for the discontinuation
of LIBOR, we have amended, or will amend, our LIBOR-referencing agreements to either reference the
Secured Overnight Financing Rate or include mechanics for selecting an alternative rate. We do not
plan to enter into variable-rate agreements that reference LIBOR in the future.
Issuances of Stock
The issuances of stock in 2022 and 2021 were related to the exercise of stock options by employees.
Share Repurchases
In 2012, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase plan of up to 500 million shares (“2012
Plan”) of the Company’s common stock. In May 2022, the Company reached the maximum number of shares
that could be repurchased under the 2012 Plan and thereby completed the plan. In 2019, our Board of
Directors authorized a new share repurchase plan of up to 150 million shares of the Company’s common
stock.
During 2022, the total cash outflow for treasury stock purchases was $1,418 million. The Company
repurchased 21.3 million shares of common stock under the share repurchase plans authorized by our
Board of Directors. These shares were repurchased at an average price per share of $62.67, for a
total cost of $1,336 million. Since the inception of our share repurchase program in 1984, we have
repurchased 3.5 billion shares of our common stock at an average price per share of $17.53. In
addition to shares repurchased under the share repurchase plans authorized by our Board of Directors,
the Company’s treasury stock activity also includes shares surrendered to the Company to pay the
exercise price and/or to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with so-called stock swap
exercises of employee stock options and/or the vesting of restricted stock issued to employees. The
net impact of the Company’s issuances of stock and share repurchases during 2022 resulted in a net
cash outflow of $581 million.
During 2021, the Company did not repurchase shares of our common stock under the share repurchase
plans authorized by our Board of Directors.
Dividends
The Company paid dividends of $7,616 million and $7,252 million during the years ended December 31,
2022 and 2021, respectively.
At its February 2023 meeting, our Board of Directors increased our regular quarterly dividend to
$0.46 per share, equivalent to a full year dividend of $1.84 per share in 2023. This is our 61 st
consecutive annual increase. Our annualized common stock dividend was $1.76 per share and $1.68 per
share in 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Other Financing Activities
During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the total cash outflow for other financing
activities was $1,095 million and $353 million, respectively. The activities during 2022 included
payments totaling $637 million related to the BodyArmor acquisition, which included amounts
originally held back for indemnification obligations. Additionally, other financing activities during
2022 and 2021 included repayments of collateral related to our hedging programs.

1 Refer to Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding
loans and notes payable. Upon payment of outstanding commercial paper, we typically issue new
commercial paper. Lines of credit and other short-term borrowings are expected to fluctuate depending
upon current liquidity needs, especially at international subsidiaries.
2 Refer to Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding
long-term debt. We will consider several alternatives for settling this long-term debt, including the
use of cash flows from operating activities, issuance of commercial paper or issuance of other long-
term debt. The table above shows expected cash payments to be made by the Company and excludes the
noncash portion of debt, including any fair market value adjustments, unamortized discounts and
premiums.
3 We calculated estimated interest payments for our long-term debt based on the applicable rates and
payment dates. For our variable-rate debt, we have assumed the December 31, 2022 rate for all periods
presented. We expect to fund such interest payments with cash flows from operating activities and/or
short-term borrowings.
4 Refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding
income taxes. Accrued income taxes include $2,886 million related to the one-time transition tax
required by the Tax Reform Act. Liabilities of $1,424 million for unrecognized tax benefits plus
accrued interest and penalties are not included in the total above. Currently, the settlement period
for the unrecognized tax benefits cannot be determined. In addition, any payments related to
unrecognized tax benefits may be partially or fully offset by reductions in payments in other
jurisdictions.
5 Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and
legally binding and that specify all significant terms. These agreements include long-term
contractual obligations, open purchase orders, accounts payable and certain accrued liabilities. We
expect to fund these purchase obligations with cash flows from operating activities.
6 We expect to fund these marketing obligations with cash flows from operating activities.
7 Represents obligations related to our acquisitions of fairlife and BodyArmor. Refer to Note 2 of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
8 Represents $823 million received in December 2022 in advance of the refranchising of the Company’s
bottling operations in Vietnam in January 2023 as well as liabilities and contractual obligations
that were classified as held for sale. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
for additional information.
The total accrued liability for pension and other postretirement benefit plans recognized as of
December 31, 2022 was $942 million. Refer to Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
This amount is impacted by, among other items, net periodic benefit cost or income, plan funding
levels, plan amendments, changes in plan demographics and assumptions, and the investment return on
plan assets. Because the accrued liability does not represent expected liquidity needs, we did not
include this amount in the table above.
We expect to make all contributions to our pension trusts with cash flows from operating activities.
Our pension plans are generally funded in accordance with local laws and tax regulations. The Company
expects to contribute approximately $42 million in 2023 to our pension trusts, all of which will be
allocated to our international plans. Refer to Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
We did not include our estimated contributions to our pension trusts in the table above.

As of December 31, 2022, the projected benefit obligation of the U.S. qualified pension plan was
$4,101 million, and the fair value of the plan assets was $4,336 million. The projected benefit
obligation of all pension plans other than the U.S. qualified pension plan was $2,275 million, and
the fair value of the plans’ assets was $2,822 million. The Company sponsors various unfunded pension
plans outside the United States as well as unfunded nonqualified pension plans covering certain U.S.
employees. These U.S. nonqualified pension plans provide benefits that are not permitted to be funded
through a qualified plan because of limits imposed by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The expected
benefit payments for these unfunded pension plans are not included in the table above. However, we
anticipate benefit payments for these unfunded pension plans will be approximately $65 million
annually for 2023 through 2025. Thereafter, the expected annual benefit payments will gradually
decline. Refer to Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
In general, we are self-insured for large portions of many different types of claims; however, we do
use commercial insurance above our self-insured retentions to reduce the Company’s risk of
catastrophic loss. Our reserves for the Company’s self-insured losses are estimated using actuarial
methods and assumptions of the insurance industry, adjusted for our specific expectations based on
our claims history. As of December 31, 2022, our self-insurance reserves totaled $199 million. Refer
to Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We did not include estimated payments
related to our self-insurance reserves in the table above.
Deferred income tax liabilities as of December 31, 2022 were $2,914 million. Refer to Note 14 of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. This amount is not included in the table above because we
believe that presentation would not be meaningful. Deferred income tax liabilities are calculated
based on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their respective
book bases, which will result in taxable amounts in future years when the underlying assets or
liabilities are settled at their reported financial statement amounts. The results of these
calculations do not have a direct connection with the amount of cash taxes to be paid in any future
years. As a result, scheduling deferred income tax liabilities as payments due by period could be
misleading, because this scheduling would not relate to liquidity needs.
As of December 31, 2022, we were contingently liable for guarantees of indebtedness owed by third
parties of $1,017 million, of which $133 million was related to VIEs. Our guarantees are primarily
related to third-party customers, bottlers and vendors and arose through the normal course of
business. These guarantees have various terms, and none of these guarantees is individually
significant. These amounts represent the maximum potential future payments that we could be required
to make under the guarantees. However, management has concluded that the likelihood of any
significant amounts being paid by our Company under these guarantees is not probable. As of December
31, 2022, we were not directly liable for the debt of any unconsolidated entity.
 Foreign Exchange 
Our international operations are subject to certain opportunities and risks, including currency
fluctuations and governmental actions. We closely monitor our operations in each country and seek to
adopt appropriate strategies that are responsive to changing economic and political environments as
well as to fluctuations in currencies. Due to the geographic diversity of our operations, weakness in
some currencies may be offset by strength in other currencies over time.
In 2022 and 2021, the weighted-average exchange rates for foreign currencies in which the Company
conducted operations (all operating currencies), and for certain individual currencies, strengthened
(weakened) against the U.S. dollar as follows:
 Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 
 ─────────────────────────────────────────────────── 
 All operating currencies -8 % 2 % 
 Australian dollar -7 % 10 % 
 Brazilian real 4 -4 
 British pound sterling -11 3 
 Euro -11 5 
 Japanese yen -17 -2 
 Mexican peso 1 6 
 South African rand -9 6 
The percentages in the table above do not include the effects of our hedging activities and,
therefore, do not reflect the actual impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on our
operating results. Our hedging activities are designed to mitigate, over time, a portion of the
potentially unfavorable impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our net income.
The total impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on net operating revenues, including
the effect of our hedging activities, was a decrease of 7 percent in 2022 and an increase of 1
percent in 2021. The total impact of foreign currency
 57 
exchange rate fluctuations on income before income taxes, including the effect of our hedging
activities, was a decrease of 6 percent in 2022 and an increase of 2 percent in 2021.
Foreign currency exchange gains and losses are primarily the result of the remeasurement of monetary
assets and liabilities from certain currencies into functional currencies. The effects of the
remeasurement of these assets and liabilities are partially offset by the impact of our economic
hedging program for certain exposures on our consolidated balance sheet. Refer to Note 5 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements. Foreign currency exchange gains and losses are recorded in the
line item other income (loss) — net in our consolidated statement of income. Refer to the heading
“Operations Review — Other Income (Loss) — Net” above. The Company recorded net foreign currency
exchange losses of $236 million and $61 million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021,
respectively.
 Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices 
Inflation affects the way we operate in many markets around the world. In general, we believe that,
over time, we will be able to increase prices to counteract the majority of the inflationary effects
of increasing costs and to generate sufficient cash flows to maintain our productive capability.

│ ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK │
Our Company uses derivative financial instruments primarily to reduce our exposure to adverse
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, commodity prices and other market
risks. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. As a matter of
policy, all of our derivative positions are used to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic
exposure. Because of the high correlation between the hedging instruments and the underlying
exposures, fluctuations in the values of the instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes
in the values of the underlying exposures.
We monitor our exposure to market risks using several objective measurement systems, including a
sensitivity analysis to measure our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates,
interest rates and commodity prices. Refer to Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
for additional information about our hedging transactions and derivative financial instruments.
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rates 
We manage most of our foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis, which allows us to net
certain exposures and take advantage of any natural offsets. In 2022, we generated $27.6 billion of
our net operating revenues from operations outside the United States. Due to the geographic diversity
of our operations, weakness in some currencies may be offset by strength in other currencies over
time. We use derivative financial instruments to further reduce our net exposure to foreign currency
exchange rate fluctuations.
Our Company enters into forward exchange contracts and purchases foreign currency options and collars
(principally euro, British pound sterling and Japanese yen) to hedge certain portions of forecasted
cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. Additionally, we enter into forward exchange contracts
to offset the earnings impact related to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on certain
monetary assets and liabilities. We also enter into forward exchange contracts as hedges of net
investments in foreign operations.
The total notional values of our foreign currency derivatives were $11,370 million and $13,691
million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These values included derivative instruments
that were designated and qualified for hedge accounting along with derivative instruments that are
economic hedges. The fair value of foreign currency derivatives that qualified for hedge accounting
resulted in a net unrealized loss of $66 million as of December 31, 2022, and we estimate that a 10
percent weakening of the U.S. dollar would have increased the net unrealized loss to $296 million.
The fair value of the foreign currency derivatives that did not qualify for hedge accounting resulted
in a net unrealized loss of $20 million as of December 31, 2022, and we estimate that a 10 percent
weakening of the U.S. dollar would have resulted in a $137 million decrease in fair value.
 Interest Rates 
The Company is subject to interest rate volatility with regard to existing and future issuances of
debt. We monitor our mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt as well as our mix of short-term debt
and long-term debt. From time to time, we enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our
exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
Based on the Company’s variable-rate debt and derivative instruments outstanding as of December 31,
2022, we estimate that a 1 percentage point increase in interest rates would have increased interest
expense by $136 million in 2022. However, this increase in interest expense would have been partially
offset by the increase in interest income due to higher interest rates.
 58 
The Company is subject to interest rate risk related to its investments in highly liquid debt
securities. These investments are primarily managed by external managers within the guidelines of the
Company’s investment policy. Our policy requires these investments to be investment grade, with the
primary objective of minimizing the risk of principal loss. In addition, our policy limits the amount
of credit exposure to any one issuer. We estimate that a 1 percentage point increase in interest
rates would have resulted in a $29 million decrease in the fair value of our portfolio of highly
liquid debt securities.
 Commodity Prices 
The Company is subject to market risk with respect to commodity price fluctuations, principally
related to our purchases of sweeteners, metals, juices, PET and fuels. We manage our exposure to
commodity risks primarily through the use of supplier pricing agreements, which enable us to
establish the purchase prices for certain inputs that are used in our manufacturing and distribution
operations. When deemed appropriate, we use derivative financial instruments to further manage our
exposure to commodity risks. Certain of these derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting, but
they are effective economic hedges that help the Company mitigate the price risk associated with the
purchases and transportation of materials used in our manufacturing processes.
The total notional values of our commodity derivatives were $371 million and $918 million as of
December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These values included derivative instruments that were
designated and qualified for hedge accounting along with derivative instruments that are economic
hedges. There were no significant commodity derivatives that qualified for hedge accounting as of
December 31, 2022 . The fair value of the commodity derivatives that did not qualify for hedge
accounting resulted in a net loss of $1 million as of December 31, 2022, and we estimate that a 10
percent decrease in underlying commodity prices would have resulted in an $8 million decrease in fair
value.

 THE COCA-COLA COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
NOTE 1: BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
When used in these notes, the terms “The Coca-Cola Company,” “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” mean The
Coca-Cola Company and all entities included in our consolidated financial statements.
Description of Business
The Coca-Cola Company is a total beverage company. We own or license and market numerous beverage
brands, which we group into the following categories: Trademark Coca-Cola; sparkling flavors; water,
sports, coffee and tea; juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages; and emerging beverages.
We own and market fiveof the world’s top six nonalcoholic sparkling soft drink brands: Coca-Cola,
Sprite, Fanta, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar and Diet Coke/Coca-Cola Light. Finished beverage products bearing
our trademarks, sold in the United States since 1886, are now sold in more than 200countries and
territories.
We make our branded beverage products available to consumers throughout the world through our network
of independent bottling partners, distributors, wholesalers and retailers as well as the Company’s
consolidated bottling and distribution operations. Beverages bearing trademarks owned by or licensed
to us account for 2.2billion of the estimated 64billion servings of all beverages consumed worldwide
every day.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”). The preparation of our consolidated
financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Although these estimates are based
on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future, actual results may
ultimately differ from these estimates and assumptions. Furthermore, when testing assets for
impairment in future periods, if management uses different assumptions or if different conditions
occur, impairment charges may result.
Principles of Consolidation
Our Company consolidates all entities that we control by ownership of a majority voting interest.
Additionally, there are situations in which consolidation is required even though the usual condition
of consolidation (i.e., ownership of a majority voting interest) does not apply. Generally, this
occurs when an entity holds an interest in another business enterprise that was achieved through
arrangements that do not involve voting interests, which results in a disproportionate relationship
between such entity’s voting interests in, and its exposure to the economic risks and potential
rewards of, the other business enterprise. This disproportionate relationship results in what is
known as a variable interest, and the entity in which we have the variable interest is referred to as
a “VIE.” An enterprise must consolidate a VIE if it is determined to be the primary beneficiary of
the VIE. The primary beneficiary has both (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most
significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or the
right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.
Our Company holds interests in certain VIEs, primarily bottling operations, for which we were not
determined to be the primary beneficiary. Our variable interests in these VIEs primarily relate to
equity investments, profit guarantees or subordinated financial support. Refer to Note 11. Although
these financial arrangements resulted in our holding variable interests in these entities, they did
not empower us to direct the activities of the VIEs that most significantly impact the VIEs’ economic
performance. Our Company’s investments, plus any loans and guarantees, and other subordinated
financial support related to these VIEs totaled $ 1,626million and $ 1,980million as of December 31,
2022 and 2021, respectively, representing our maximum exposures to loss. The Company’s investments,
plus any loans and guarantees, related to these VIEs were not individually significant to the
Company’s consolidated financial statements.
In addition, our Company holds interests in certain VIEs, primarily bottling operations, for which we
were determined to be the primary beneficiary. As a result, we have consolidated these entities. Our
Company’s investments, plus any loans and guarantees, related to these VIEs totaled $ 109million and
$ 103million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, representing our maximum exposures to
loss. The assets and liabilities of VIEs for which we are the primary beneficiary were not
significant to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
Creditors of our VIEs do not have recourse against the general credit of the Company, regardless of
whether they are accounted for as consolidated entities.
 66 
We use the equity method to account for investments in companies if our investment provides us with
the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies of the investee.
Our consolidated net income includes our Company’s proportionate share of the net income or loss of
these companies. Our judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investee
includes considering key factors, such as our ownership interest, representation on the board of
directors, participation in policy-making decisions, other commercial arrangements and material
intercompany transactions.
We eliminate from our financial results all significant intercompany transactions, including the
intercompany transactions with consolidated VIEs and the intercompany portion of transactions with
equity method investees.
Revenue Recognition
Our Company recognizes revenue when performance obligations under the terms of the contracts with our
customers are satisfied. Our performance obligation generally consists of the promise to sell
concentrates, syrups or finished products to our bottling partners, wholesalers, distributors or
retailers. Refer to Note 3.
Advertising Costs
Our Company expenses production costs of print, radio, television and other advertisements as of the
first date the advertisements take place. All other marketing expenditures are expensed in the annual
period in which the expenditure is incurred. Advertising costs included in the line item selling,
general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income were $ 4billion, $
4billion and $ 3billion in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021,
advertising and production costs of $ 35million and $ 57million, respectively, were primarily
recorded in the line item prepaid expenses and other current assets in our consolidated balance
sheets.
Shipping and Handling Costs
Shipping and handling costs related to the movement of goods from our manufacturing locations to our
sales distribution centers are included in the line item cost of goods sold in our consolidated
statement of income. Shipping and handling costs incurred to move goods from our manufacturing
locations or sales distribution centers to our customers are also included in the line item cost of
goods sold in our consolidated statement of income, except for costs incurred to distribute goods
sold by our consolidated bottlers to our customers, which are included in the line item selling,
general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of income. Our customers generally
do not pay us separately for shipping and handling costs. We recognize the cost of shipping and
handling activities that are performed after a customer obtains control of the goods as costs to
fulfill our promise to provide goods to the customer. As a result of this election, the Company does
not evaluate whether shipping and handling activities are services promised to customers. If revenue
is recognized for the related goods before the shipping and handling activities occur, the related
costs of those shipping and handling activities are accrued.
Sales, Use, Value-Added and Excise Taxes
The Company collects taxes imposed directly on its customers related to sales, use, value-added,
excise and other similar taxes. The Company then remits such taxes on behalf of its customers to the
applicable governmental authorities. We exclude from net operating revenues the tax amounts imposed
on revenue-producing transactions that were collected from our customers to be remitted to
governmental authorities. Accordingly, such tax amounts are recorded in the line item trade accounts
receivable in our consolidated balance sheet when collection of taxes from the customer has not yet
occurred and are recorded in the line item accounts payable and accrued expenses in our consolidated
balance sheet until they are remitted to the applicable governmental authorities. Taxes imposed
directly on the Company, whether based on receipts from sales, inventory procurement costs or
manufacturing activities, are recorded in the line item cost of goods sold in our consolidated
statement of income.
Net Income Per Share
Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to shareowners of The
Coca-Cola Company by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting
period. Diluted net income per share is computed similarly to basic net income per share, except that
it includes the potential dilution that could occur if dilutive securities were exercised. We
excluded 8million, 6million and 6million stock options from the computation of diluted net income per
share in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, because the stock options would have been antidilutive.
Cash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash and Restricted Cash Equivalents
We classify time deposits and other investments that are highly liquid and have maturities of
threemonths or less at the date of purchase as cash equivalents or restricted cash equivalents, as
applicable. Restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents generally consist of amounts held by our
captive insurance companies, which are included in the line item other noncurrent assets in our
consolidated balance sheet. We manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk through specific
minimum credit standards, diversification of counterparties and procedures to monitor our
concentrations of credit risk.
 67 
The following table provides a summary of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash
equivalents that constitute the total amounts shown in our consolidated statements of cash flows (in
millions):
 December 31, 2022 2021 2020

1 Amounts include cash and cash equivalents in our solvency capital portfolio, which are included in
the line item other noncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 4.
2 Amounts as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 include cash and cash equivalents related to assets held
for sale, which are included in the line item prepaid expenses and other current assets in our
consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 2.
Short-Term Investments
We classify time deposits and other investments that have maturities of greater than threemonths but
less than oneyear as short-term investments.
Investments in Equity and Debt Securities
We measure all equity investments that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under
the equity method at fair value with the change in fair value included in net income. We use quoted
market prices to determine the fair value of equity securities with readily determinable fair values.
For equity securities without readily determinable fair values, we have elected the measurement
alternative under which we measure these investments at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus
changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a
similar investment of the same issuer. Management assesses each of these investments on an individual
basis. Our investments in debt securities are carried at either amortized cost or fair value.
Investments in debt securities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to
maturity are carried at amortized cost and classified as held-to-maturity. Investments in debt
securities that are not classified as held-to-maturity are carried at fair value and classified as
either trading or available-for-sale. Refer to Note 4 for additional information on our policy for
investments, which includes our assessment of impairments.
Trade Accounts Receivable
We record trade accounts receivable at net realizable value. This value includes an appropriate
allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts to reflect any expected loss on the trade accounts
receivable balances and charged to the provision for doubtful accounts. We calculate this allowance
based on available relevant information, in addition to historical loss information, the level of
past-due accounts based on the contractual terms of the receivables, and our relationships with, and
the economic status of, our bottling partners and customers. We believe our exposure to
concentrations of credit risk is limited due to the diverse geographic areas covered by our
operations.
The Company has a trade accounts receivable factoring program in certain countries. Under this
program, we can elect to sell trade accounts receivables to unaffiliated financial institutions at a
discount. In these factoring arrangements, for ease of administration, the Company collects customer
payments related to the factored receivables and remits those payments to the financial institutions.
The Company sold $ 10,709million and $ 6,266million of trade accounts receivables under this program
during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The costs of factoring such
receivables were $ 27million and $ 5million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021,
respectively. The Company accounts for this program as a sale, and accordingly, the trade receivables
sold are excluded from the line item trade accounts receivable in our consolidated balance sheet. The
cash received from the financial institutions is classified within the operating activities section
in our consolidated statement of cash flows.
Inventories
Inventories consist primarily of raw materials and packaging (which include ingredients and supplies)
and finished goods (which include concentrates and syrups in our concentrate operations and finished
beverages in our finished product operations). Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net
realizable value. We determine cost on the basis of the average cost or first-in, first-out methods.
 68 
Inventories consisted of the following (in millions):
 December 31, 2022 2021 
 ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── 
 Raw materials and packaging $ 2,627 $ 2,133 
 Finished goods 1,247 982 
 Other 359 299 
 Total inventories $ 4,233 $ 3,414 
Derivative Instruments
When deemed appropriate, our Company uses derivatives as a risk management tool to mitigate the
potential impact of certain market risks. The primary market risks managed by the Company through the
use of derivative instruments are foreign currency exchange rate risk, commodity price risk and
interest rate risk. All derivatives are carried at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet in
the following line items, as applicable: prepaid expenses and other current assets; other noncurrent
assets; accounts payable and accrued expenses; and other noncurrent liabilities. The cash flow impact
of the Company’s derivative instruments is primarily included in our consolidated statement of cash
flows in net cash provided by operating activities. Refer to Note 5.
Leases
We determine if a contract contains a lease at its inception based on whether or not the Company has
the right to control the asset during the contract period and other facts and circumstances. We are
the lessee in a lease contract when we obtain the right to control the asset. Operating lease right-
of-use (“ROU”) assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and are
included in the line item other noncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease
liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease and are included
in the line items accounts payable and accrued expenses and other noncurrent liabilities in our
consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized
based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at the
commencement date. When determining the lease term, we include renewal or termination options that we
are reasonably certain to exercise. Leases with a lease term of 12 months or less at inception are
not recorded in our consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-
line basis over the lease term in our consolidated statement of income. As most of our leases do not
provide an implicit interest rate, we use our local incremental borrowing rate based on the
information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of future payments.
When our contracts contain lease and non-lease components, we account for both components as a single
lease component. Refer to Note 9.
We have various contracts for certain fountain equipment under which we are the lessor. These leases
meet the criteria for operating lease classification. Lease income associated with these leases is
not material.
Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Repair and maintenance costs that do not improve
service potential or extend economic life are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is recorded
principally by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of our assets, which are
reviewed periodically and generally have the following ranges: buildings and improvements: 40years or
less; and machinery and equipment: 20years or less. Land is not depreciated, and construction in
progress is not depreciated until ready for service. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the
straight-line method over the shorter of the remaining lease term, including renewal options that we
are reasonably certain to exercise, or the estimated useful life of the improvement. Depreciation is
not recorded during the period in which a long-lived asset or disposal group is classified as held
for sale, even if the asset or disposal group continues to generate revenue during the period.
Depreciation expense, including the depreciation expense of assets under finance leases, totaled $
1,125million, $ 1,262million and $ 1,301million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Amortization
expense for leasehold improvements totaled $ 13million, $ 15million and $ 18million in 2022, 2021 and
2020, respectively.
 69 
The following table summarizes our property, plant and equipment (in millions):
 December 31, 2022 2021 
 ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── 
 Land $ 611 $ 652 
 Buildings and improvements 4,434 4,349 
 Machinery and equipment 14,030 13,861 
 Property, plant and equipment — cost 19,075 18,862 
 Less: Accumulated depreciation 9,234 8,942 
 Property, plant and equipment — net $ 9,841 $ 9,920 
Certain events or changes in circumstances may indicate that the recoverability of the carrying
amount of property, plant and equipment should be assessed, including, among others, a significant
decrease in market value, a significant change in the business climate in a particular market, or a
current period operating or cash flow loss combined with historical losses or projected future
losses. When such events or changes in circumstances are present and a recoverability test is
performed, we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset or asset
group and its eventual disposition. These estimated future cash flows are consistent with those we
use in our internal planning. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without
interest charges) is less than the carrying amount, we recognize an impairment charge. The impairment
charge recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the
fair value. We use a variety of methodologies to determine the fair value of property, plant and
equipment, including appraisals and discounted cash flow models. These appraisals and models include
assumptions we believe are consistent with those a market participant would use.
Goodwill, Trademarks and Other Intangible Assets
We classify intangible assets into three categories: (1) intangible assets with definite lives
subject to amortization; (2) intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization; and
(3) goodwill. We determine the useful lives of our identifiable intangible assets after considering
the specific facts and circumstances related to each intangible asset. Factors we consider when
determining useful lives include the contractual term of any agreement related to the asset, the
historical performance of the asset, the Company’s long-term strategy for using the asset, any laws
or other local regulations which could impact the useful life of the asset, and other economic
factors, including competition and specific market conditions. Intangible assets that are deemed to
have definite lives are amortized, primarily on a straight-line basis, over their useful lives, which
is less than 20years. Refer to Note 7.
When events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of definite-lived intangible assets may
not be recoverable, management performs a recoverability test of the carrying value by preparing
estimates of sales volume and the resulting profit and cash flows expected to result from the use of
the asset or asset group and its eventual disposition. These estimated future cash flows are
consistent with those we use in our internal planning. If the sum of the expected future cash flows
(undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount, we recognize an
impairment charge. The impairment charge recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the
asset or asset group exceeds the fair value. We use a variety of methodologies to determine the fair
value of these assets, including discounted cash flow models, which include assumptions we believe
are consistent with those a market participant would use.
We test intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful lives, including trademarks, franchise
rights and goodwill, for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate
that assets might be impaired. Our Company performs these annual impairment tests as of the first day
of our third fiscal quarter. We use a variety of methodologies in conducting impairment tests of
indefinite-lived intangible assets, including, but not limited to, discounted cash flow models, which
include assumptions we believe are consistent with those a market participant would use. For
indefinite-lived intangible assets, other than goodwill, if the carrying amount exceeds the fair
value, an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The Company has the
option to perform a qualitative assessment of indefinite-lived intangible assets, other than
goodwill, rather than completing the impairment test. The Company must assess whether it is more
likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. If the
Company concludes that this is the case, it must perform the impairment testing described above.
Otherwise, the Company does not need to perform any further assessment.
We perform impairment tests of goodwill at our reporting unit level, which is generally one level
below our operating segments. Our operating segments are primarily based on geographic
responsibility, which is consistent with the way management runs our business. Our geographic
operating segments are generally subdivided into smaller geographic regions. These geographic regions
are our reporting units. Our Global Ventures operating segment includes the results of our Costa
Limited (“Costa”), innocent and doğadan businesses, as well as fees earned pursuant to distribution
coordination agreements between the Company and Monster Beverage Corporation (“Monster”), each of
which is its own reporting unit. The Bottling
 70 
Investments operating segment includes all of our consolidated bottling operations, regardless of
geographic location. Generally, each consolidated bottling operation within our Bottling Investments
operating segment is its own reporting unit. Goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit or units that
benefit from the synergies arising from each business combination.
In order to test for goodwill impairment, the Company compares the fair value of the reporting unit
to its carrying value,
including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount,
goodwill is written down for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. However,
the impairment charge recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. We typically use
discounted cash flow models to determine the fair value of a reporting unit. The assumptions used in
these models are consistent with those we believe a market participant would use. The Company has the
option to perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill in order to determine whether it is more
likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the
Company concludes that this is the case, it must perform the impairment testing discussed above.
Otherwise, the Company does not need to perform any further assessment.
Impairment charges related to intangible assets, including goodwill, are generally recorded in the
line item other operating charges or, to the extent they relate to equity method investees, in the
line item equity income (loss) — net in our consolidated statement of income.
Contingencies
Our Company is involved in various legal proceedings and tax matters. Due to their nature, such legal
proceedings and tax matters involve inherent uncertainties, including, but not limited to, court
rulings, negotiations between affected parties and governmental actions. Management assesses the
probability of loss for such contingencies and accrues a liability and/or discloses the relevant
circumstances, as appropriate. Refer to Note 11.
Stock-Based Compensation
Our Company grants long-term equity awards under its stock-based compensation plans to certain
employees of the Company. These awards include stock options, performance share units, restricted
stock and restricted stock units. The fair value of stock option awards is estimated using a Black-
Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. The Company recognizes compensation expense on a straight-line
basis over the vesting period, which is generally four years.
The fair value of restricted stock, restricted stock units and certain performance share units is the
closing market price per share of the Company’s stock on the grant date less the present value of the
expected dividends not received during the vesting period. The Company included a relative total
shareowner return (“TSR”) modifier for most performance share unit awards granted from 2014 through
2017 as well as for performance share unit awards granted to executives from 2018 through 2022. For
these awards, the number of performance share units earned based on the certified achievement of the
predefined performance criteria will be reduced or increased if the Company’s total shareowner return
over the performance period relative to a predefined compensation comparator group of companies falls
outside of a predefined range. The fair value of performance share units that include a TSR modifier
is determined using a Monte Carlo valuation model.
In the reporting period it becomes probable that the minimum performance threshold specified in the
performance share unit award will be achieved, we recognize compensation expense for the
proportionate share of the total fair value of the performance share units related to the vesting
period that has already lapsed for the performance share units expected to vest. The remaining fair
value of the performance share units expected to vest is expensed on a straight-line basis over the
remainder of the vesting period. In the event the Company determines it is no longer probable that
the minimum performance threshold specified in the award will be achieved, we reverse all of the
previously recognized compensation expense in the reporting period such a determination is made.
The Company has made a policy election to estimate the number of stock-based compensation awards that
will ultimately vest to determine the amount of compensation expense recognized each reporting
period. Forfeiture estimates are trued-up at the end of the vesting period in order to ensure that
compensation expense is recognized only for those awards that ultimately vest. Refer to Note 12.
Income Taxes
Income tax expense includes U.S., state, local and international income taxes. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the book
basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. The tax rate used to determine the deferred tax
assets and liabilities is the enacted tax rate for the year and manner in which the differences are
expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount
that will more likely than not be realized.
The Company is involved in various tax matters, with respect to some of which the outcome is
uncertain. We establish reserves to remove some or all of the tax benefit of any of our tax positions
at the time we determine that it becomes uncertain based
 71 
upon one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is not “more likely than not” to be
sustained; (2) the tax position is “more likely than not” to be sustained, but for a lesser amount;
or (3) the tax position is “more likely than not” to be sustained, but not in the financial period in
which the tax position was originally taken. For purposes of evaluating whether or not a tax position
is uncertain, (1) we presume the tax position will be examined by the relevant taxing authority that
has full knowledge of all relevant information; (2) the technical merits of a tax position are
derived from authorities such as legislation and statutes, legislative intent, regulations, rulings
and caselaw and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position; and (3) each
tax position is evaluated without consideration of the possibility of offset or aggregation with
other tax positions taken. A number of years may elapse before a particular uncertain tax position is
audited and finally resolved or when a tax assessment is raised. The number of years subject to tax
assessments varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously
reserved because of a failure to meet the “more likely than not” recognition threshold would be
recognized in income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty disappears under
any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is “more likely than not” to be sustained;
(2) the tax position, amount and/or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation;
or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. Refer to Note 11 and Note 14.
Translation and Remeasurement
We translate the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries from their respective functional
currencies to U.S. dollars at the appropriate spot rates as of the balance sheet date. Generally, our
foreign subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency. Changes in the carrying
values of these assets and liabilities attributable to fluctuations in spot rates are recognized in
net foreign currency translation adjustments, a component of accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss) (“AOCI”). Refer to Note 15. Accounts in our consolidated statement of income are translated
using the monthly average exchange rates during the year.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency that is different from a reporting entity’s
functional currency must be remeasured from the applicable currency to the reporting entity’s
functional currency. The effects of the remeasurement of these assets and liabilities are recognized
in the line item other income (loss) — net in our consolidated statement of income and are partially
offset by the impact of our economic hedging program for certain exposures on our consolidated
balance sheet. Refer to Note 5.
 NOTE 2: ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES 
Acquisitions
During 2022, our Company’s acquisitions of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable
securities totaled $ 73million. During 2021, our Company’s acquisitions of businesses, equity method
investments and nonmarketable securities totaled $ 4,766million, which primarily related to the
acquisition of the remaining ownership interest in BA Sports Nutrition, LLC (“BodyArmor”). During
2020, our Company’s acquisitions of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable
securities totaled $ 1,052million, which primarily related to the acquisition of the remaining
ownership interest in fairlife, LLC (“fairlife”).
BA Sports Nutrition, LLC
In November 2021, the Company acquired the remaining 85percent ownership interest in, and now owns
100percent of, BodyArmor, which offers a line of sports performance and hydration beverages in the
United States. We acquired the remaining ownership interest in exchange for approximately $
5,600million of cash, of which $ 4,745million was paid at close, net of cash acquired. The purchase
price reflected the contractual discount included in the purchase option we obtained with our initial
investment in 2018. The remaining $ 860million of the purchase price was held back related to
indemnification obligations, of which $ 540million was included in the line item accounts payable and
accrued expenses and $ 320million was included in the line item other noncurrent liabilities in our
consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2022, $ 549million of the $
860million had been paid and $ 311million remained in the line item accounts payable and accrued
expenses in our consolidated balance sheet. Upon consolidation, we recognized a gain of $ 834million
resulting from the remeasurement of our previously held equity interest in BodyArmor to fair value.
The fair value of our previously held equity interest was determined using a discounted cash flow
model based on Level 3 inputs, as defined in Note 16. The gain was recorded in the line item other
income (loss) — net in our consolidated statement of income. Upon finalization of purchase
accounting, $ 4.2billion of the purchase price was allocated to the BodyArmor trademark and $
2.2billion was allocated to goodwill, of which $ 1.2billion is tax deductible. The goodwill
recognized as part of this acquisition is primarily related to the synergistic value created from
leveraging the capabilities, assets and scale of the Company and the opportunity for international
expansion. It also includes certain other intangible assets that do not qualify for separate
recognition, such as an assembled workforce. Of the total amount allocated to goodwill, $ 1.9billion
has been assigned to the North America operating segment and $ 0.3billion has been assigned to our
other geographic operating segments.
 72 
fairlife, LLC
In January 2020, the Company acquired the remaining 57.5percent ownership interest in, and now owns
100percent of, fairlife. fairlife offers a broad portfolio of products in the value-added dairy
category across North America. Upon consolidation, we recognized a gain of $ 902million resulting
from the remeasurement of our previously held equity interest in fairlife to fair value. The fair
value of our previously held equity interest was determined using a discounted cash flow model based
on Level 3 inputs, as defined in Note 16. The gain was recorded in the line item other income (loss)
— net in our consolidated statement of income. We acquired the remaining ownership interest in
exchange for $ 979million of cash, net of cash acquired, and effectively settled our $ 306million
note receivable from fairlife at the recorded amount. Under the terms of the agreement, we are
subject to making future milestone payments which are contingent on fairlife achieving certain
financial targets through 2024 and, if achieved, are payable in 2021, 2023 and 2025. These milestone
payments are based on agreed-upon formulas related to fairlife’s operating results, the resulting
values of which are not subject to a ceiling. Under the applicable accounting guidance, we recorded a
$ 270million liability representing our best estimate of the fair value of this contingent
consideration as of the acquisition date. The fair value of this contingent consideration was
determined using a Monte Carlo valuation model based on Level 3 inputs, including management’s latest
estimates of future operating results. We are required to remeasure this liability to fair value
quarterly, with any changes in the fair value recorded in income until the final milestone payment is
made. Upon finalization of purchase accounting, $ 1.3billion of the purchase price was allocated to
the fairlife trademark and $ 0.8billion was allocated to goodwill. The goodwill recognized as part of
this acquisition is primarily related to synergistic value created from the opportunity for
additional expansion. It also includes certain other intangible assets that do not qualify for
separate recognition, such as an assembled workforce. The goodwill is not tax deductible and has been
assigned to the North America operating segment.
During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recorded charges of $ 1,000million, $
369million and $ 51million, respectively. These charges related to the remeasurement of the
contingent consideration liability to fair value and were recorded in the line item other operating
charges in our consolidated statements of income. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we made
the first milestone payment of $ 100million based on fairlife meeting its financial targets in 2020.
Divestitures
During 2022, proceeds from disposals of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable
securities totaled $ 458million, which primarily related to the refranchising of our bottling
operations in Cambodia. We received net cash proceeds of $ 228million and recognized a net gain of $
153million as a result of the refranchising. Also included was the sale of our ownership interest in
one of our equity method investees, for which we received cash proceeds of $ 123million and
recognized a net gain of $ 13million.
During 2021, proceeds from disposals of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable
securities totaled $ 2,180million, which primarily related to the sale of our ownership interest in
Coca-Cola Amatil Limited (“CCA”), an equity method investee, to Coca-Cola Europacific Partners plc
(“CCEP”), also an equity method investee. We received cash proceeds of $ 1,738million and recognized
a net gain of $ 695million as a result of the sale and the related reversal of cumulative translation
adjustments. Also included were the sale of our ownership interest in an equity method investee and
the sale of a portion of our ownership interest in another equity method investee. We received cash
proceeds of $ 293million and recognized a net gain of $ 114million as a result of these sales.
During 2020, proceeds from disposals of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable
securities totaled $ 189million, which primarily related to the sale of our ownership interest in
Piedmont Coca-Cola Bottling Partnership to Coca-Cola Consolidated, Inc., an equity method investee.
We received cash proceeds of $ 100million and recognized a net loss of $ 2million as a result of this
sale. Also included were the sale of our ownership interest in an equity method investee and the sale
of a portion of our ownership interest in another equity method investee. We received cash proceeds
of $ 62million and recognized a net gain of $ 35million as a result of these sales.
All of the gains and losses discussed above were recorded in the line item other income (loss) — net
in our consolidated statements of income.
Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale
As of December 31, 2021, the Company’s bottling operations in Vietnam and Cambodia met the criteria
to be classified as held for sale. As a result, we were required to record their assets and
liabilities at the lower of carrying value or fair value less any costs to sell. As the fair value
less any costs to sell exceeded the carrying value, the related assets and liabilities were recorded

 NOTE 3: NET OPERATING REVENUES 
Our Company markets, manufactures and sells:
• beverage concentrates, sometimes referred to as “beverage bases,” and syrups, including fountain
syrups (we refer to this part of our business as our “concentrate operations”); and
• finished sparkling soft drinks and other beverages (we refer to this part of our business as our
“finished product operations”).
Generally, finished product operations generate higher net operating revenues but lower gross profit
margins than concentrate operations.
Our concentrate operations typically generate net operating revenues by selling concentrates, syrups
and certain finished beverages to authorized bottling operations (to which we typically refer as our
“bottlers” or our “bottling partners”). Our bottling partners either combine concentrates with still
or sparkling water and sweeteners (depending on the product), or combine syrups with still or
sparkling water, to produce finished beverages. The finished beverages are packaged in authorized
containers, such as cans and refillable and nonrefillable glass and plastic bottles, bearing our
trademarks or trademarks licensed to us and are then sold to retailers directly or, in some cases,
through wholesalers or other bottlers. In addition, outside the United States, our bottling partners
are typically authorized to manufacture fountain syrups, using our concentrates, which they sell to
fountain retailers for use in producing beverages for immediate consumption, or to authorized
fountain wholesalers who in turn sell and distribute the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. Our
concentrate operations are included in our geographic operating segments and our Global Ventures
operating segment.
Our finished product operations generate net operating revenues by selling sparkling soft drinks and
a variety of other finished beverages to retailers, or to distributors and wholesalers who in turn
sell the beverages to retailers. These operations consist primarily of our consolidated bottling and
distribution operations, which are included in our Bottling Investments operating segment. In certain
markets, the Company also operates non-bottling finished product operations in which we sell finished
beverages to distributors and wholesalers that are generally not one of the Company’s bottling
partners. These operations are generally included in one of our geographic operating segments or our
Global Ventures operating segment. Additionally, we sell directly to consumers through retail stores
operated by Costa. These sales are included in our Global Ventures operating segment. In the United
States, we manufacture fountain syrups and sell them to fountain retailers, who use the fountain
syrups to produce beverages for immediate consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers or
bottling partners who in turn sell the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. These fountain syrup
sales are included in our North America operating segment.
 74 
Revenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of the contracts with our
customers are satisfied. Our performance obligation generally consists of the promise to sell
concentrates, syrups or finished products to our bottling partners, wholesalers, distributors or
retailers. Control of the concentrates, syrups or finished products is transferred upon shipment to,
or receipt at, our customers’ locations, as determined by the specific terms of the contract. Upon
transfer of control to the customer, which completes our performance obligation, revenue is
recognized. Our sales terms generally do not allow for a right of return except for matters related
to any manufacturing defects on our part. After completion of our performance obligation, we have an
unconditional right to consideration as outlined in the contract. Our receivables will generally be
collected in less than six months, in accordance with the underlying payment terms. All of our
performance obligations under the terms of contracts with our customers have an original duration of
one year or less.
Our customers and bottling partners may be entitled to cash discounts, funds for promotional and
marketing activities, volume-based incentive programs, support for infrastructure programs and other
similar programs. In most markets, in an effort to allow our Company and our bottling partners to
grow together through shared value, aligned financial objectives and the flexibility necessary to
meet consumers’ always changing needs and tastes, we have implemented an incidence-based concentrate
pricing model. Under this model, the price we charge bottlers for concentrates they use to prepare
and package finished products is impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the
prices charged by the bottlers for such finished products, the channels in which they are sold, and
package mix. The amounts associated with the arrangements described above represent variable
consideration, an estimate of which is included in the transaction price as a component of net
operating revenues in our consolidated statement of income upon completion of our performance
obligations. The total revenue recorded, including any variable consideration, cannot exceed the
amount for which it is probable that a significant reversal will not occur when uncertainties related
to variability are resolved. As a result, we are recognizing revenue based on our faithful depiction
of the consideration that we expect to receive. In making our estimates of variable consideration, we
consider past results and make significant assumptions related to: (1) customer sales volumes; (2)
customer ending inventories; (3) customer selling price per unit; (4) selling channels; and (5)
discount rates, rebates and other pricing allowances, as applicable. In gathering data to estimate
our variable consideration, we generally calculate our estimates using a portfolio approach at the
country and product line level rather than at the individual contract level. The result of making
these estimates will impact the line items trade accounts receivable or accounts payable and accrued
expenses in our consolidated balance sheet, as applicable. The actual amounts ultimately paid and/or
received may be different from our estimates. The change in the amount of variable consideration
recognized during the year ended December 31, 2022 related to performance obligations satisfied in
prior periods was immaterial.

 NOTE 4: INVESTMENTS 
We measure all equity investments that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under
the equity method at fair value with the change in fair value included in net income. We use quoted
market prices to determine the fair values of equity securities with readily determinable fair
values. For equity securities without readily determinable fair values, we have elected the
measurement alternative under which we measure these investments at cost minus impairment, if any,
plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the
identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. Management assesses each of these investments
on an individual basis.
Our investments in debt securities are carried at either amortized cost or fair value. The cost basis
is determined by the specific identification method. Investments in debt securities that the Company
has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost and classified
as held-to-maturity. Investments in debt securities that are not classified as held-to-maturity are
carried at fair value and classified as either trading or available-for-sale. Realized and unrealized
gains and losses on trading debt securities as well as realized gains and losses on available-for-
sale debt securities are included in net income. Unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, on
available-for-sale debt securities are included in our consolidated balance sheet as a component of
AOCI, except for the changes in fair values attributable to the currency risk being hedged, if
applicable, which are included in net income. Refer to Note 5 for additional information related to
the Company’s fair value hedges of available-for-sale debt securities.
Equity securities with readily determinable fair values that are not accounted for under the equity
method and debt securities classified as trading are not assessed for impairment, since they are
carried at fair value with the change in fair value included in net income. Equity method
investments, equity securities without readily determinable fair values and debt securities
classified as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity are reviewed each reporting period to determine
whether a significant event or change in circumstances has occurred that may have an adverse effect
on the fair value of each investment. When such events or changes occur, we evaluate the fair value
compared to our cost basis in the investment. We also perform this evaluation every reporting period
for each investment for which our cost basis has exceeded the fair value. The fair values of most of
our Company’s investments in publicly traded companies are often readily available based on quoted
market prices. For investments in nonpublicly traded companies, management’s assessment of fair value
is based on various valuation methodologies, including discounted cash flows, estimates of sales
proceeds, and appraisals, as appropriate. We consider the assumptions that we believe a market
participant would use in evaluating estimated future cash flows when employing the discounted cash
flow or estimates of sales proceeds valuation methodologies. The ability to accurately predict future
cash flows, especially in emerging and developing markets, may impact the determination of fair
value. In the event the fair value of an investment declines below our cost basis, management is
required to determine if the decline in fair value is other than temporary. If management determines
the decline is other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded. Management’s assessment as to
the nature of a decline in fair value is based on, among other things, the length of time and the
extent to which the market value has been less than our cost basis; the financial condition and near-
term prospects of the issuer; and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of
time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.

Captive Insurance Companies
In accordance with local insurance regulations, our consolidated captive insurance companies are
required to meet and maintain minimum solvency capital requirements. The Company elected to invest a
majority of its solvency capital in a portfolio of marketable equity and debt securities. These
securities are included in the disclosures above. The Company uses one of our consolidated captive
insurance companies to reinsure group annuity insurance contracts that cover the obligations of
certain of our European and Canadian pension plans. This captive’s solvency capital funds included
total equity and debt securities of $ 1,378million and $ 1,670million as of December 31, 2022 and
2021, respectively, which were classified in the line item other noncurrent assets in our
consolidated balance sheets because the assets were not available to satisfy our current obligations.
NOTE 5: HEDGING TRANSACTIONS AND DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Company is directly and indirectly affected by changes in certain market conditions. These
changes in market conditions may adversely impact the Company’s financial performance and are
referred to as “market risks.” When deemed appropriate, our Company uses derivatives as a risk
management tool to mitigate the potential impact of certain market risks. The primary market risks
managed by the Company through the use of derivative and non-derivative financial instruments are
foreign currency exchange rate risk, commodity price risk and interest rate risk.
The Company uses various types of derivative instruments, including, but not limited to, forward
contracts, commodity futures contracts, option contracts, collars and swaps. Forward contracts and
commodity futures contracts are agreements to buy or sell a quantity of a currency or commodity at a
predetermined future date and at a predetermined rate or price. An option contract is an agreement
that conveys the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a quantity of a currency
or commodity at a predetermined rate or price during a period or at a time in the future. A collar is
a strategy that uses a combination of options to limit the range of possible positive or negative
returns on an underlying asset or liability to a specific range, or to protect expected future cash
flows. To do this, an investor simultaneously buys a put option and sells (writes) a call option, or
alternatively buys a call option and sells (writes) a put option. A swap agreement is a contract
between two parties to exchange cash flows based on specified underlying notional amounts, assets
and/or indices. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. The
Company may also designate certain non-derivative instruments, such as our foreign currency
denominated third-party debt, in hedging relationships.
All derivative instruments are carried at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet, primarily in
the following line items, as applicable: prepaid expenses and other current assets; other noncurrent
assets; accounts payable and accrued expenses; and other noncurrent liabilities. The carrying values
of the derivatives reflect the impact of legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash
collateral held or placed with the same counterparties, as applicable. These master netting
agreements allow the Company to net settle positive and negative positions (assets and liabilities)
arising from different transactions with the same counterparty.
The accounting for gains and losses that result from changes in the fair values of derivative
instruments depends on whether the derivatives have been designated and qualify as hedging
instruments and the type of hedging relationships. Derivatives can be designated as fair value
hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of net investments in foreign operations. The changes in the fair
values of derivatives that have been designated and qualify for fair value hedge accounting are
recorded in the same line item in our consolidated statement of income as the changes in the fair
values of the hedged items attributable to the risk being hedged. The changes in the fair values of
derivatives that have been designated and qualify as cash flow hedges or hedges of net investments in
foreign operations are recorded in AOCI and are reclassified into the line item in our consolidated
statement of income in which the hedged items are recorded in the same period the hedged items affect
earnings. Due to the high degree of effectiveness between the hedging instruments and the underlying
exposures being hedged, fluctuations in the values of the derivative instruments are generally offset
by changes in the fair values or cash flows of the underlying exposures being hedged. The changes in
the fair values of derivatives that were not designated and/or did not qualify as hedging instruments
are immediately recognized in earnings.
For derivatives that will be accounted for as hedging instruments, the Company formally designates
and documents, at inception, the financial instrument as a hedge of a specific underlying exposure,
the risk management objective and the strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction. In addition,
the Company formally assesses, both at the inception and at least quarterly thereafter, whether the
financial instruments used in hedging transactions are effective at offsetting changes in either the
fair values or cash flows of the related underlying exposures.
The Company determines the fair values of its derivatives based on quoted market prices or pricing
models using current market rates. Refer to Note 16. The notional amounts of the derivative financial
instruments do not necessarily represent amounts exchanged by the parties and, therefore, are not a
direct measure of our exposure to the financial risks described above. The amounts exchanged are
calculated by reference to the notional amounts and by other terms of the derivatives, such as
interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity rates or other financial indices. The
Company does not view the fair
 78 
values of its derivatives in isolation but rather in relation to the fair values or cash flows of the
underlying hedged transactions or other exposures. Virtually all of our derivatives are
straightforward over-the-counter instruments with liquid markets.

Credit Risk Associated with Derivatives
We have established strict counterparty credit guidelines and enter into transactions only with
financial institutions of investment grade or better. We monitor counterparty exposures regularly and
review any downgrade in credit rating immediately. If a downgrade in the credit rating of a
counterparty were to occur, we have provisions requiring collateral for substantially all of our
transactions. To mitigate presettlement risk, minimum credit standards become more stringent as the
duration of the derivative financial instrument increases. In addition, the Company’s master netting
agreements reduce credit risk by permitting the Company to net settle for transactions with the same
counterparty. To minimize the concentration of credit risk, we enter into derivative transactions
with a portfolio of financial institutions. Furthermore, for certain derivative financial
instruments, the Company has agreements with counterparties that require collateral to be exchanged
based on changes in the fair value of the instruments. The Company classifies collateral payments and
receipts as investing cash flows when the collateral account is in an asset position and as financing
cash flows when the collateral account is in a liability position. As a result of these factors, we
consider the risk of counterparty default to be minimal.
Cash Flow Hedging Strategy
The Company uses cash flow hedges to minimize the variability in cash flows of assets or liabilities
or forecasted transactions caused by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity
prices or interest rates. The changes in the fair values of derivatives designated as cash flow
hedges are recorded in AOCI and are reclassified into the line item in our consolidated statement of
income in which the hedged items are recorded in the same period the hedged items affect earnings.
The changes in fair values of hedges that are determined to be ineffective are immediately
reclassified from AOCI into earnings. The maximum length of time for which the Company hedges its
exposure to the variability in future cash flows is typically three years.
The Company maintains a foreign currency cash flow hedging program to reduce the risk that our U.S.
dollar net cash inflows from sales outside the United States and U.S. dollar net cash outflows from
procurement activities will be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
We enter into forward contracts and purchase foreign currency options and collars (principally euro,
British pound sterling and Japanese yen) to hedge certain portions of forecasted cash flows
denominated in foreign currencies. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against the foreign currencies,
the decline in the present value of future foreign currency cash flows is partially offset by gains
in the fair value of the derivative instruments. Conversely, when the U.S. dollar weakens, the
increase in the present value of future foreign currency cash flows is partially offset by losses in
the fair value of the derivative instruments. The total notional values of derivatives that were
designated and qualified for the Company’s foreign currency cash flow hedging program were $
5,510million and $ 7,399million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
The Company uses cross-currency swaps to hedge the changes in cash flows of certain of its foreign
currency denominated debt and other monetary assets or liabilities due to changes in foreign currency
exchange rates. For this hedging program, the Company recognizes in earnings each period the changes
in carrying values of these foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities due to fluctuations
in exchange rates. The changes in fair values of the cross-currency swap derivatives are recorded in
AOCI with an immediate reclassification into earnings for the changes in fair values attributable to
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The total notional values of derivatives that were
designated as cash flow hedges for the Company’s foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities
were $ 958million and $ 1,994million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
The Company has entered into commodity futures contracts and other derivative instruments on various
commodities to mitigate the price risk associated with forecasted purchases of materials used in our
manufacturing process. These derivative instruments were designated as part of the Company’s
commodity cash flow hedging program. The objective of this hedging program is to reduce the
variability of cash flows associated with future purchases of certain commodities. The total notional
values of derivatives that were designated and qualified for this program were $ 35million and $
10million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Our Company monitors our mix of short-term debt and long-term debt regularly. From time to time, we
manage our risk to interest rate fluctuations through the use of derivative financial instruments.
The Company has entered into interest rate swap agreements and has designated these instruments as
part of the Company’s interest rate cash flow hedging program. The objective of this hedging program
is to mitigate the risk of adverse changes in benchmark interest rates on the Company’s future
interest payments. There were no interest rate swap agreements that were designated and qualified for
the Company’s interest rate cash flow hedging program as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.

As of December 31, 2022, the Company estimates that it will reclassify into earnings during the next
12 months net gains of $ 56million from the pretax amount recorded in AOCI as the anticipated cash
flows occur.
Fair Value Hedging Strategy
The Company uses interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges to minimize exposure
to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate debt that result from fluctuations in benchmark interest
rates. The Company also uses cross-currency interest rate swaps to hedge the changes in the fair
value of foreign currency denominated debt relating to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
rates and benchmark interest rates. The changes in fair values of derivatives designated as fair
value hedges and the offsetting changes in fair values of the hedged items are recognized in
earnings. As a result, any difference is reflected in earnings as ineffectiveness. When a derivative
is no longer designated as a fair value hedge for any reason, including termination and maturity, the
remaining unamortized difference between the carrying value of the hedged item at that time and the
face value of the hedged item is amortized to earnings over the remaining life of the hedged item, or
immediately if the hedged item has matured or has been extinguished. The total notional values of
derivatives that were designated and qualified as fair value hedges of this type were $ 13,425million
and $ 12,113million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Hedges of Net Investments in Foreign Operations Strategy
The Company uses forward contracts and a portion of its foreign currency denominated debt, a non-
derivative financial instrument, to protect the value of our net investments in a number of foreign
operations. For derivative financial instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges of net
investments in foreign operations, the changes in the fair values of the derivative financial
instruments are recognized in net foreign currency translation adjustments, a component of AOCI, to
offset the changes in the values of the net investments being hedged. For non-derivative financial
instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges of net investments in foreign operations, the
changes in the carrying values of the designated portions of the non-derivative financial instruments
due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are recorded in net foreign currency
translation adjustments. Any ineffective portions of net investment hedges are reclassified from AOCI
into earnings during the period of change.

The Company reclassified a loss of $ 4million related to net investment hedges from AOCI into
earnings during the year ended December 31, 2021. The Company did not reclassify any gains or losses
related to net investment hedges from AOCI into earnings during the years ended December 31, 2022 and
2020. In addition, the Company did not have any ineffectiveness related to net investment hedges
during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. The cash inflows and outflows associated
with the Company’s derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges are classified in the
line item other investing activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows.
Economic (Non-Designated) Hedging Strategy
In addition to derivative instruments that were designated and qualified for hedge accounting, the
Company also uses certain derivatives as economic hedges of foreign currency, interest rate and
commodity exposure. Although these derivatives were not designated and/or did not qualify for hedge
accounting, they are effective economic hedges. The changes in the fair values of economic hedges are
immediately recognized in earnings.
The Company uses foreign currency economic hedges to offset the earnings impact that fluctuations in
foreign currency exchange rates have on certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in
nonfunctional currencies. The changes in the fair values of economic hedges used to offset those
monetary assets and liabilities are immediately recognized in earnings in the line item other income
(loss) — net in our consolidated statement of income. In addition, we use foreign currency economic
hedges to minimize the variability in cash flows associated with fluctuations in foreign currency
exchange rates, including those related to certain acquisition and divestiture activities. The
changes in the fair values of economic hedges used to offset the variability in U.S. dollar net cash
flows are immediately recognized in earnings in the line items net operating revenues, cost of goods
sold or other income (loss) — net in our consolidated statement of income, as applicable. The total
notional values of derivatives related to our foreign currency economic hedges were $ 4,902million
and $ 4,258million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
The Company uses interest rate contracts as economic hedges to minimize exposure to changes in the
fair value of fixed-rate debt that result from fluctuations in benchmark interest rates. The total
notional value of derivatives related to our economic hedges of this type was $ 200million as of
December 31, 2021. There were no interest rate contracts used as economic hedges as of December 31,
2022.
The Company also uses certain derivatives as economic hedges to mitigate the price risk associated
with the purchase of materials used in the manufacturing process and vehicle fuel. The changes in the
fair values of these economic hedges are immediately recognized in earnings in the line items net
operating revenues, cost of goods sold, or selling, general and administrative expenses in our
consolidated statement of income, as applicable. The total notional values of derivatives related to
our economic hedges of this type were $ 336million and $ 908million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021,
respectively.

 NOTE 6: EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS 
Our consolidated net income includes our Company’s proportionate share of the net income or loss of
our equity method investees. When we record our proportionate share of net income, it increases
equity income (loss) — net in our consolidated statement of income and our carrying value of that
investment. Conversely, when we record our proportionate share of a net loss, it decreases equity
income (loss) — net in our consolidated statement of income and our carrying value of that
investment. The Company’s proportionate share of the net income or loss of our equity method
investees includes significant operating and nonoperating items recorded by our equity method
investees. These items can have a significant impact on the amount of equity income (loss) — net in
our consolidated statement of income and our carrying value of those investments. Refer to Note 17
for additional information related to significant operating and nonoperating items recorded by our
equity method investees. The carrying values of our equity method investments are also impacted by
our proportionate share of items impacting the equity method investees’ AOCI.
We eliminate from our financial results all significant intercompany transactions to the extent of
our ownership interest, including the intercompany portion of transactions with equity method
investees.
The Company’s equity method investments include, but are not limited to, our ownership interests in
CCEP; Monster; AC Bebidas, S. de R.L. de C.V.; Coca-Cola FEMSA, S.A.B. de C.V.; Coca-Cola HBC AG; and
Coca-Cola Bottlers Japan Holdings Inc. (“CCBJHI”). As of December 31, 2022, we owned 19percent,
20percent, 20percent, 28percent, 21percent and 19percent, respectively, of these companies’
outstanding shares. As of December 31, 2022, our investments in our equity method investees in the
aggregate exceeded our proportionate share of the net assets of these equity method investees by $
7,822million. This difference is not amortized.
A summary of financial information for our equity method investees in the aggregate is as follows (in
millions):

were $ 16,084million, $ 14,471million and $ 13,041million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Total
payments, primarily related to marketing, made to equity method investees were $ 396million, $
516million and $ 547million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in net sales to equity
method investees in 2022 was primarily due to the continued recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. In
addition, purchases of beverage products from equity method investees were $ 505million, $ 496million
and $ 452million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

1 The carrying value of our investment in CCBJHI exceeded its fair value as of December 31, 2022 by $
29million. Based on the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than our
carrying value and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to
allow for any anticipated recovery in market value, management determined that the decline in fair
value was temporary in nature. Therefore, we did not record an impairment charge related to the
investment.
Net Receivables and Dividends from Equity Method Investees
Total net receivables due from equity method investees were $ 1,191million and $ 882million as of
December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The total amount of dividends received from equity method
investees was $ 634million, $ 823million and $ 467million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021
and 2020, respectively. The amount of consolidated reinvested earnings that represents undistributed
earnings of investments accounted for under the equity method as of December 31, 2022 was $
7,030million.

 NOTE 10: DEBT AND BORROWING ARRANGEMENTS 
Short-Term Borrowings
Loans and notes payable consist primarily of commercial paper issued in the United States. As of
December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had $ 2,146million and $ 2,462million, respectively, in outstanding
commercial paper borrowings. Our weighted-average interest rates for commercial paper outstanding
were 4.2percent and 0.1percent as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of December 31,
2022 and 2021, the Company also had $ 227million and $ 845million, respectively, in lines of credit,
short-term credit facilities and other short-term borrowings that were related to our international
operations.
In addition, we had $ 5,712million in unused lines of credit and other short-term credit facilities
as of December 31, 2022, of which $ 4,375million was in corporate backup lines of credit for general
purposes. These backup lines of credit expire at various times from 2023 through 2028. There were no
borrowings under these corporate backup lines of credit during 2022. These credit facilities are
subject to normal banking terms and conditions. Some of the financial arrangements require
compensating balances, none of which was significant to our Company.
Long-Term Debt
During 2022, the Company retired upon maturity fixed interest rate Swiss franc notes and U.S. dollar
debentures of SFr 550million and $ 410million, respectively, with interest rates ranging from
0.260percent to 8.500percent.
During 2022, our bottling operations in Africa refinanced a portion of its short-term borrowings and
issued new long-term debt. This resulted in borrowings of $ 1,368million at a weighted-average
interest rate of 5.210percent as of December 31, 2022.
During 2021, the Company issued fixed interest rate U.S. dollar notes and euro notes of $
5,950million and € 3,150million, respectively, with maturity dates ranging from 2028 to 2051 and

During 2021, the Company retired upon maturity variable interest rate euro notes of € 371million with
an interest rate equal to the three-month Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”) plus 0.200percent.
During 2021, the Company also extinguished prior to maturity fixed interest rate U.S. dollar notes
and euro notes of $ 6,500million and € 2,430million, respectively, with maturity dates ranging from
2023 to 2026 and interest rates ranging from 0.750percent to 3.200percent. These extinguishments
resulted in associated charges of $ 559million recorded in the line item interest expense in our
consolidated statement of income. These charges included the difference between the reacquisition
price and the net carrying value of the notes extinguished, including the impact of the related fair
value hedging relationships. We also incurred charges of $ 91million as a result of the
reclassification of related cash flow hedging balances from AOCI into income.
During 2020, the Company issued fixed interest rate U.S. dollar notes and euro notes of $
15,600million and € 2,600million, respectively, with maturity dates ranging from 2025 to 2060 and

extinguished prior to maturity variable interest rate euro notes of € 379million with a maturity date
in 2021 and an interest rate equal to the three-month EURIBOR plus 0.200percent. These
extinguishments resulted in associated charges of $ 459million recorded in the line item interest
expense in our consolidated statement of income. These charges included the difference between the
reacquisition price and the net carrying value of the notes extinguished, including the impact of the
related fair value hedging relationships. We also incurred charges of $ 25million as a result of the
reclassification of related cash flow hedging balances from AOCI into income.

 NOTE 11: COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
Guarantees
As of December 31, 2022, we were contingently liable for guarantees of indebtedness owed by third
parties of $ 1,017million, of which $ 133million was related to VIEs. Refer to Note 1 for additional
information related to the Company’s maximum exposure to loss due to our involvement with VIEs. Our
guarantees are primarily related to third-party customers, bottlers and vendors and arose through the
normal course of business. These guarantees have various terms, and none of these guarantees is
individually significant. These amounts represent the maximum potential future payments that we could
be required to make under the guarantees. However, management has concluded that the likelihood of
any significant amounts being paid by our Company under these guarantees is not probable.
Concentrations of Credit Risk
We believe our exposure to concentrations of credit risk is limited due to the diverse geographic
areas covered by our operations.
Legal Contingencies
The Company is involved in various legal proceedings. We establish reserves for specific legal
proceedings when we determine that the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome is probable and the
amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Management has also identified certain other legal
matters where we believe an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible and/or for which no estimate
of possible losses can be made. Management believes that the total liabilities of the Company that
may arise as a result of currently pending legal proceedings (excluding tax audit claims) will not
have a material adverse effect on the Company taken as a whole.
Indemnifications
At the time we acquire or divest an ownership interest in an entity, we sometimes agree to indemnify
the seller or buyer for specific contingent liabilities. Management believes that any liability to
the Company that may arise as a result of any such indemnification agreements will not have a
material adverse effect on the Company taken as a whole.
Tax Audits
The Company is involved in various tax matters, with respect to some of which the outcome is
uncertain. These uncertain tax matters may result in the assessment of additional taxes. Refer to
Note 14.
On September 17, 2015, the Company received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency (“Notice”) from the U.S.
Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) seeking approximately $ 3.3billion of additional federal income tax
for years 2007 through 2009. In the Notice, the IRS stated its intent to reallocate over $ 9billion
of income to the U.S. parent company from certain of its foreign affiliates that the U.S. parent
company licensed to manufacture, distribute, sell, market and promote its products in certain
non-U.S. markets.
The Notice concerned the Company’s transfer pricing between its U.S. parent company and certain of
its foreign affiliates. IRS rules governing transfer pricing require arm’s-length pricing of
transactions between related parties such as the Company’s U.S. parent and its foreign affiliates.
To resolve the same transfer pricing issue for the tax years 1987 through 1995, the Company and the
IRS had agreed in 1996 on an arm’s-length methodology for determining the amount of U.S. taxable
income that the U.S. parent company would report as compensation from its foreign licensees. The
Company and the IRS memorialized this accord in a closing agreement resolving that dispute (“Closing
Agreement”). The Closing Agreement provided that, absent a change in material facts or circumstances
or relevant federal tax law, in calculating the Company’s income taxes going forward, the Company
would not be assessed penalties by the IRS for using the agreed-upon tax calculation methodology that
the Company and the IRS agreed would be used for the 1987 through 1995 tax years.
The IRS audited and confirmed the Company’s compliance with the agreed-upon Closing Agreement
methodology in five successive audit cycles for tax years 1996 through 2006.
The September 17, 2015 Notice from the IRS retroactively rejected the previously agreed-upon
methodology for the 2007 through 2009 tax years in favor of an entirely different methodology,
without prior notice to the Company. Using the new tax calculation methodology, the IRS reallocated
over $ 9billion of income to the U.S. parent company from its foreign licensees for tax years 2007
through 2009. Consistent with the Closing Agreement, the IRS did not assert penalties, and it has yet
to do so.
 90 
The IRS designated the Company’s matter for litigation on October 15, 2015. Litigation designation is
an IRS determination that forecloses to a company any and all alternative means for resolution of a
tax dispute. As a result of the IRS’ designation of the Company’s matter for litigation, the Company
was forced to either accept the IRS’ newly imposed tax assessment and pay the full amount of the
asserted tax or litigate the matter in the federal courts. The matter remains subject to the IRS’
litigation designation, preventing the Company from any attempt to settle or otherwise mutually
resolve the matter with the IRS.
The Company consequently initiated litigation by filing a petition in the U.S. Tax Court (“Tax
Court”) in December 2015, challenging the tax adjustments enumerated in the Notice.
Prior to trial, the IRS increased its transfer pricing adjustment by $ 385million, resulting in an
additional tax adjustment of $ 135million. The Company obtained a summary judgment in its favor on a
different matter related to Mexican foreign tax credits, which thereafter effectively reduced the
IRS’ potential tax adjustment by $ 138million.
The trial was held in the Tax Court from March through May 2018, and final post-trial briefs were
filed and exchanged in April 2019.
On November 18, 2020, the Tax Court issued an opinion (“Opinion”) in which it predominantly sided
with the IRS but agreed with the Company that dividends previously paid by the foreign licensees to
the U.S. parent company in reliance upon the Closing Agreement should continue to be allowed to
offset royalties, including those that would become payable to the Company in accordance with the
Opinion. The Tax Court reserved ruling on the effect of Brazilian legal restrictions on the payment
of royalties by the Company’s licensee in Brazil until after the Tax Court issues its opinion in the
separate case of 3M Co. & Subs. v. Commissioner, T.C. Docket No. 5816-13 (filed March 11, 2013). The
Tax Court issued its opinion in 3M Co.’s case (“3M Co. opinion”) on February 9, 2023. Once the Tax
Court completes its analysis of the application of the 3M Co. opinion to the Company’s case, the
Company expects the Tax Court to render another opinion, and ultimately a final decision, in the
Company’s case.
The Company believes that the IRS and the Tax Court misinterpreted and misapplied the applicable
regulations in reallocating income earned by the Company’s foreign licensees to increase the
Company’s U.S. tax. Moreover, the Company believes that the retroactive imposition of such tax
liability using a calculation methodology different from that previously agreed upon by the IRS and
the Company, and audited by the IRS for over a decade, is unconstitutional. The Company intends to
assert its claims on appeal and vigorously defend its position.
In determining the amount of tax reserve to be recorded as of December 31, 2020, the Company
completed the required two-step evaluation process prescribed by Accounting Standards Codification
740, Accounting for Income Taxes . In doing so, we consulted with outside advisors, and we reviewed
and considered relevant laws, rules, and regulations, including, but not limited to, the Opinion and
relevant caselaw. We also considered our intention to vigorously defend our positions and assert our
various well-founded legal claims via every available avenue of appeal. We concluded, based on the
technical and legal merits of the Company’s tax positions, that it is more likely than not the
Company’s tax positions will ultimately be sustained on appeal. In addition, we considered a number
of alternative transfer pricing methodologies, including the methodology asserted by the IRS and
affirmed in the Opinion (“Tax Court Methodology”), that could be applied by the courts upon final
resolution of the litigation. Based on the required probability analysis, we determined the
methodologies we believe the federal courts could ultimately order to be used in calculating the
Company’s tax. As a result of this analysis, we recorded a tax reserve of $ 438million during the
year ended December 31, 2020 related to the application of the resulting methodologies as well as the
different tax treatment applicable to dividends originally paid to the U.S. parent company by its
foreign licensees, in reliance upon the Closing Agreement, that would be recharacterized as royalties
in accordance with the Opinion and the Company’s analysis.
The Company’s conclusion that it is more likely than not the Company’s tax positions will ultimately
be sustained on appeal is unchanged as of December 31, 2022. However, we updated our calculation of
the methodologies we believe the federal courts could ultimately order to be used in calculating the
Company’s tax. As a result of the application of the required probability analysis to these updated
calculations and the accrual of interest through the current reporting period, we updated our tax
reserve as of December 31, 2022 to $ 423million.
While the Company strongly disagrees with the IRS’ positions and the portions of the Opinion
affirming such positions, it is possible that some portion or all of the adjustment proposed by the
IRS and sustained by the Tax Court could ultimately be upheld. In that event, the Company would
likely be subject to significant additional liabilities for tax years 2007 through 2009, and
potentially also for subsequent years, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s
financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
The Company calculated the potential impact of applying the Tax Court Methodology to reallocate
income from foreign licensees potentially covered within the scope of the Opinion, assuming such
methodology were to be ultimately upheld by the courts, and the IRS were to decide to apply that
methodology to subsequent years, with consent of the federal courts. This
 91 
impact would include taxes and interest accrued through December 31, 2022 for the 2007 through 2009
litigated tax years and for subsequent tax years from 2010 through 2022. The calculations
incorporated the estimated impact of correlative adjustments to the previously accrued transition tax
payable under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Reform Act”). The Company estimates that the
potential aggregate incremental tax and interest liability could be approximately $ 14billion as of
December 31, 2022. Additional income tax and interest would continue to accrue until the time any
such potential liability, or portion thereof, were to be paid. We currently project the continued
application of the Tax Court Methodology in future years, assuming similar facts and circumstances as
of December 31, 2022, would result in an incremental annual tax liability that would increase the
Company’s effective tax rate by approximately 3.5percent.
The Company does not know when the Tax Court will issue its opinion regarding the effect of Brazilian
legal restrictions on the payment of royalties by the Company’s licensee in Brazil for the 2007
through 2009 tax years. After the Tax Court issues its opinion on the Company’s Brazilian licensee,
the Company and the IRS will be provided time to agree on the tax impact, if any, of both opinions,
after which the Tax Court would render a final decision in the case. The Company will have 90 days
thereafter to file a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit and pay
the tax liability and interest related to the 2007 through 2009 tax years. The Company currently
estimates that the payment to be made at that time related to the 2007 through 2009 tax years, which
is included in the above estimate of the potential aggregate incremental tax and interest liability,
would be approximately $ 5.2billion (including interest accrued through December 31, 2022), plus any
additional interest accrued through the time of payment. Some or all of this amount would be refunded
if the Company were to prevail on appeal.
Risk Management Programs
The Company has numerous global insurance programs in place to help protect the Company from the risk
of loss. In general, we are self-insured for large portions of many different types of claims;
however, we do use commercial insurance above our self-insured retentions to reduce the Company’s
risk of catastrophic loss. Our reserves for the Company’s self-insured losses are estimated using
actuarial methods and assumptions of the insurance industry, adjusted for our specific expectations
based on our claims history. Our self-insurance reserves totaled $ 199million and $ 229million as of
December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
 NOTE 12: STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS 
Our Company grants long-term equity awards under its stock-based compensation plans to certain
employees of the Company. The Coca-Cola Company 2014 Equity Plan (“2014 Equity Plan”) was approved by
shareowners in April 2014. Under the 2014 Equity Plan, a maximum of 500million shares of our common
stock was approved to be issued through the grant of equity awards. The 2014 Equity Plan allows for
grants of stock options, performance share units, restricted stock, restricted stock units and other
specified award types, including cash awards with performance-based vesting criteria. As of December
31, 2022, there were 308million shares available to be granted under the 2014 Equity Plan. In
addition, there were 3million shares available for stock option and restricted stock award grants
under plans approved by shareowners prior to 2014.
From 2015 to 2017, certain employees who had previously been eligible for long-term equity awards
received long-term performance-based cash awards. Employees who received these performance-based cash
awards did not receive equity awards as part of the long-term incentive program. In 2017, the Company
changed the long-term incentive program for employees previously eligible for the performance-based
cash award. These employees no longer participate in the long-term incentive program and were granted
a final restricted stock unit award that vests ratably over five years.
Total stock-based compensation expense was $ 361million, $ 337million and $ 141million in 2022, 2021
and 2020, respectively. In 2022, for certain employees who accepted voluntary separation from the
Company as a result of the restructuring of our North America operating unit, the Company provided
cash payments designed to offset the loss of certain equity awards and serve as a cash supplement to
employees upon the exercise of certain stock options. In 2020, for certain employees who accepted
voluntary separation from the Company as a result of our strategic realignment initiatives, the
Company modified their outstanding equity awards so that the employees retained all or some of their
awards, whereas otherwise the awards would have been forfeited. The incremental stock-based
compensation expense in 2022 arising from the cash payments was $ 5million, and the incremental
stock-based compensation expense in 2020 arising from the modification of awards was $ 15million.
These amounts were recorded in the line item other operating charges in our consolidated statements
of income. Refer to Note 18 for additional information on the Company’s restructuring and strategic
realignment initiatives. The remainder of stock-based compensation expense in 2022 and 2020 of $
356million and $ 126million, respectively, and all stock-based compensation expense in 2021 were
recorded in the line item selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements
of income. The total income tax benefit recognized in our consolidated statements of income related
to total stock-based compensation expense was $ 55million, $ 60million and $ 32million in 2022, 2021
and 2020, respectively.
 92 
As of December 31, 2022, we had $ 325million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to
nonvested stock-based compensation awards granted under our plans, which we expect to recognize over
a weighted-average period of 1.9years as stock‑based compensation expense. This expected cost does
not include the impact of any future stock-based compensation awards.
Stock Option Awards
Stock option awards are generally granted with an exercise price equal to the average of the high and
low market prices per share of the Company’s stock on the grant date. The fair value of each stock
option award is estimated using a Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model and is expensed on a
straight-line basis over the vesting period, which is generally four years.
The weighted-average fair value of stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2022,
2021 and 2020 and the weighted-average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing
model for such grants were as follows:
 Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020

 Risk-free interest rate3 1.9 % 0.9 % 1.4 % 
 Expected term of stock options4 6 years 6 years 6 years 
1 The dividend yield is the calculated yield on the closing market price per share of the Company’s
stock on the grant date.
2 The expected volatility is based on implied volatilities from traded options on the Company’s
stock, historical volatility of the Company’s stock and other factors.
3 The risk-free interest rate for the period matching the expected term of the stock options is based
on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect on the grant date.
4 The expected term of the stock options represents the period of time that stock options are
expected to be outstanding and is derived by analyzing historical exercise behavior.
Stock option awards generally expire 10years after the grant date. The shares of common stock to be
issued and/or sold upon the exercise of stock options are made available from either authorized and
unissued common stock or from treasury shares. Since 2007, the Company has issued common stock under
its stock-based compensation plans from treasury shares.
Stock option activity during the year ended December 31, 2022 was as follows:

Performance-Based Share Unit Awards
Performance share unit awards require achievement of certain performance criteria, which are
predefined by the Talent and Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors at the time of grant.
For performance share unit awards granted from 2015 through 2017, the performance criteria were
economic profit and net operating revenues over a predefined performance period of three years.
Economic profit is our net operating profit after tax less the cost of the capital used in our
business. Economic profit and net operating revenues were adjusted for certain items, which were
approved by the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. The purpose of these adjustments was to
ensure a consistent year-to-year comparison of the specific performance criteria. Most of these
awards included a relative TSR modifier to determine the final number of performance share units
earned. For these awards, the number of performance share units earned based on the certified
achievement of the predefined
 93 
performance criteria was reduced or increased if the Company’s total shareowner return over the
performance period relative to a predefined compensation comparator group of companies fell outside
of a predefined range. The fair value of these performance share units was determined using a Monte
Carlo valuation model. The performance share unit awards granted from 2015 through 2017 were subject
to a one-year holding period after the performance period before the shares were released.
For performance share unit awards granted from 2018 through 2022, the performance criteria were
equally weighted among net operating revenues, earnings per share and free cash flow over a
predefined performance period of three years. For performance share unit awards granted to executives
in 2022, the performance criteria were weighted 30 percent for net operating revenues, 30 percent for
earnings per share, 30 percent for free cash flow and 10 percent for environmental sustainability.
For purposes of these performance criteria, earnings per share is diluted net income per share; free
cash flow is net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and
equipment; and environmental sustainability is comprised of predefined goals related to the Company’s
packaging and water security strategies. These performance criteria are adjusted for certain items,
if applicable, which are subject to Audit Committee approval. The purpose of these adjustments is to
ensure a consistent year-to-year comparison of the specific performance criteria. Performance share
unit awards granted to executives include a relative TSR modifier to determine the final number of
performance share units earned. The fair value of performance share units that include a TSR modifier
is determined using a Monte Carlo valuation model. For these awards, the number of performance share
units earned based on the certified achievement of the predefined performance criteria will be
reduced or increased if the Company’s total shareowner return over the performance period relative to
a predefined compensation comparator group of companies falls outside of a predefined range. The fair
value of performance share units that do not include a TSR modifier is the closing market price per
share of the Company’s stock on the grant date less the present value of the expected dividends not
received during the performance period. The performance share unit awards will generally vest at the
end of the respective performance period.
During 2021, in addition to granting performance share unit awards with a three-year performance
period, the Company granted emerging stronger performance share unit awards with a predefined
performance period of two years. The award’s performance criterion was earnings per share, and the
award included a relative TSR modifier. Earnings per share for these purposes was diluted net income
per share adjusted for certain items, which were approved by the Audit Committee. The purpose of
these adjustments was to ensure a consistent year-to-year comparison of the performance criterion.
These performance share unit awards generally vested at the end of the two-year performance period.
For performance share unit awards, in the event the certified results equal the predefined
performance criteria, the number of performance share units earned will be equal to the target award.
In the event the certified results exceed the predefined performance criteria, additional performance
share units up to the maximum award will be earned. In the event the certified results fall below the
predefined performance criteria but are at or above the minimum threshold, a reduced number of
performance share units will be earned. If the certified results fall below the minimum threshold, no
performance share units will be earned. Performance share unit awards do not entitle participants to
vote or receive dividends until the performance share units are settled in stock.
In the reporting period it becomes probable that the minimum performance threshold specified in the
performance share unit award will be achieved, we recognize compensation expense for the
proportionate share of the total fair value of the performance share units related to the vesting
period that has already lapsed for the performance share units expected to vest. The remaining fair
value of the performance share units expected to vest is expensed on a straight-line basis over the
remainder of the vesting period. In the event the Company determines it is no longer probable that
the minimum performance threshold specified in the award will be achieved, we reverse all previously
recognized compensation expense in the reporting period such a determination is made.
Performance share units earned are generally settled in stock, except for certain circumstances such
as death or disability, in which case beneficiaries or employees are provided cash payments. As of
December 31, 2022, nonvested performance share units of approximately 1,949,000and 1,757,000were
outstanding for the 2021-2023 and 2022-2024 performance periods, respectively, based on the target
award amounts.

Time-Based Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Unit Awards
Time-based restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards granted under the 2014 Equity Plan do
not entitle recipients to vote or receive dividends during the vesting period and will be forfeited
in the event of the recipient’s termination of employment, except for certain circumstances such as
death or disability. The fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units is the closing
market price per share of the Company’s stock on the grant date less the present value of the
expected dividends not received during the vesting period. The fair value of the restricted stock and
restricted stock units expected to vest and be released is expensed on a straight-line basis over the

obligation. The accumulated benefit obligation for our pension plans was $ 6,307million and $
8,431million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
2 An increase in the weighted-average discount rate assumption was the primary driver of net
actuarial gain during 2022 and 2021. For our U.S. qualified pension plan, an increase in the discount
rate resulted in an actuarial gain of $ 1,231million during 2022, and an increase in the discount
rate resulted in an actuarial gain of $ 197million during 2021. Additional drivers of net actuarial
gain included other assumption updates and plan experience.
3 Settlements were primarily related to our strategic realignment initiatives. Refer to Note 18.

securities and combinations of both. There are a significant number of mutual, pooled and commingled
funds from which investors can choose. The selection of the type of fund is dictated by the specific
investment objectives and needs of a given plan. These objectives and needs vary greatly between
plans.
2 Fair value disclosures related to our pension plan assets are included in Note 16. Fair value
disclosures include, but are not limited to, the levels within the fair value hierarchy in which the
fair value measurements in their entirety fall; a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances
of Level 3 assets; and information about the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure the fair
value of our pension plan assets.
Investment Strategy for U.S. Pension Plan
The Company utilizes the s ervices of investment managers to actively manage the assets of our U.S.
qualified pension plan. We have established asset allocation targets and investment guidelines with
each investment manager. Our asset allocation targets promote optimal expected return and volatility
characteristics given the long-term time horizon for fulfilling the obligations of the plan.
Selection of the targeted asset allocation for U.S. pension plan assets is based upon a review of the
expected return and risk characteristics of each asset class, as well as the correlation of returns
among asset classes. Our target allocation is a mix of 18percent equity securities, 47percent fixed-
income securities and 35percent alternative investments. We believe this target allocation will
enable us to achieve the following long-term investment objectives:
(1) optimize the long-term return on plan assets at an acceptable level of risk;
(2) maintain a broad diversification across asset classes and among investment managers; and
(3) maintain careful control of the risk level within each asset class.
The investment guidelines that have been established with each investment manager provide parameters
within which the investment managers agree to operate, including criteria that determine eligible and
ineligible securities, diversification requirements and credit quality standards, where applicable.
Investment managers agree to obtain written approval for deviations from stated investment style or
guidelines. As of December 31, 2022, no investment manager was responsible for more than 24percent of
total U.S. pension plan assets.
Our target allocation of 18percent equity securities is composed of 81percent global equities,
11percent emerging market equities and 8percent domestic small-cap and mid-cap equities. Optimal
returns through our investments in global equities are achieved through security selection as well as
country and sector diversification. As of December 31, 2022, investments in our common stock
accounted for 9percent of total global equities and 5percent of total U.S. pension plan assets. Our
investments in global equities are intended to provide diversified exposure to both U.S. and non-U.S.
equity markets. Our investments in both emerging market equities and domestic small-cap and mid-cap
equities may experience large swings in their market value. Our investments in these asset classes
are selected based on capital appreciation potential.
Our target allocation of 47percent fixed-income securities is composed of 62percent long-duration
bonds and 38percent with multi-strategy alternative credit managers. Long-duration bonds are intended
to provide a stable rate of return through investments in high-quality publicly traded debt
securities. Our investments in long-duration bonds are diversified in order to
 98 
mitigate duration and credit exposure. Multi-strategy alternative credit managers invest in a
combination of high-yield bonds, bank loans, structured credit and emerging market debt. These
investments are in lower-rated and non-rated debt securities, which generally produce higher returns
compared to long-duration bonds and also help diversify our overall fixed-income portfolio.
Our target allocation for alternative investments is 35percent. These alternative investments include
hedge funds, reinsurance, private equity limited partnerships, leveraged buyout funds, international
venture capital partnerships and real estate. The objective of investing in alternative investments
is to provide a higher rate of return than that which is typically available from publicly traded
equity securities. Alternative investments are inherently illiquid and require a long-term
perspective in evaluating investment performance.
Investment Strategy for Non-U.S. Pension Plans
The long-term target allocation for 66percent of our international subsidiaries’ pension plan assets,
primarily certain of our European and Canadian plans, is 66percent equity securities, 16percent
fixed-income securities and 18percent other investments. The actual allocation for the remaining
34percent of the Company’s international subsidiaries’ pension plan assets consisted of 39percent
mutual, pooled and commingled funds; 23percent fixed-income securities; 2percent equity securities;
and 36percent other investments as of December 31, 2022. The investment strategies for our
international subsidiaries’ pension plans vary greatly, and in some instances are influenced by local
law. None of our pension plans outside the United States is individually significant for separate
disclosure.
Other Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets
Plan assets associated with other postretirement benefits primarily represent funding of one of the
U.S. postretirement health care benefit plans through a Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association
(“VEBA”), a tax-qualified trust. The VEBA assets are primarily invested in liquid assets due to the
level and timing of expected future benefit payments.

1 The Company has elected to use the actual fair value of plan assets as the market-related value of
plan assets in the determination of the expected return on plan assets.
2 Actuarial gains and losses are amortized using a corridor approach. The gain/loss corridor is equal
to 10percent of the greater of the benefit obligation and the market-related value of assets. Gains
and losses in excess of the corridor are generally amortized over the average future working lifetime
of the plan participants.

The discount rate assumption used to account for pension and other postretirement benefit plans
reflects the rate at which the benefit obligations could be effectively settled. The discount rate
for U.S. and certain non-U.S. plans is determined using a matching technique whereby the rates of a
yield curve, developed from high-quality debt securities, are applied to projected benefit cash flows
to determine the appropriate effective discount rate. For other non-U.S. plans, we base the discount
rate assumption on comparable indices within each of the countries. The Company measures the service
cost and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost or income for pension and other
postretirement benefit plans by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the plans’
projected benefit cash flows. The rate of compensation increase assumption is determined by the
Company based upon annual reviews.
The cash balance interest crediting rate for the U.S. qualified pension plan is based on the yield on
six-month U.S. Treasury bills on the last day of September of the previous plan year, plus 150 basis
points, with a minimum interest crediting rate of 3.80percent for all active employees and certain
former employees. The Company assumes that the ultimate interest crediting rate is 140 basis points
lower than the plan’s year-end discount rate and that the current interest crediting rate will
converge with the ultimate interest crediting rate after a period of 10years.
The expected long-term rate of return assumption for U.S. pension plan assets is based upon the
target asset allocation and is determined using forward-looking assumptions in the context of
historical returns and volatilities for each asset class, as well as correlations among asset
classes. We evaluate the expected long-term rate of return assumption on an annual basis. The
expected long-term rate of return assumption used in computing 2022 net periodic benefit income for
the U.S. pension plans was 6.75percent. As of December 31, 2022, the 5-year, 10-year and 15-year
annualized return for the U.S. pension plan assets was 4.8percent, 6.8percent and 5.2percent,
respectively. The annualized return since inception was 10.0percent.
The weighted-average assumptions for health care cost trend rates were as follows:
 December 31, 2022 2021 
 ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── 
 Health care cost trend rate assumed for 8.25 % 6.75 % 
 next year 
 Rate to which the trend rate is assumed 5.50 % 5.25 % 
 to decline (the ultimate trend rate) 
 Year that the trend rate reaches the 2030 2027 
 ultimate trend rate 
We review external data and our own historical trends for health care costs to determine the health
care cost trend rate assumptions. The Company’s U.S. postretirement health care benefits are
primarily provided through plans with either a capped Company cost or a defined-dollar benefit. This
limits the effects of health care inflation on the Company.

The Company anticipates making contributions of approximately $ 42million to our pension trusts in
2023, all of which will be allocated to our international plans. These contributions are made in
accordance with local laws and tax regulations.
Defined Contribution Plans
Our Company sponsors qualified defined contribution plans covering substantially all U.S. employees.
Under the largest U.S. defined contribution plan, we match participants’ contributions up to a
maximum of 3.0percent to 3.5percent of compensation, subject to an IRS limit on compensation. The
Company’s expense for the U.S. plans totaled $ 45million, $ 32million and $ 43million in 2022, 2021
and 2020, respectively. We also sponsor defined contribution plans in certain locations outside the
United States. The Company’s expense for these plans totaled $ 79million in both 2022 and 2021 and $
63million in 2020.
Multi-Employer Retirement Plans
The Company participates in various multi-employer retirement plans, which are designed to provide
benefits to, or on behalf of, employees of multiple employers. These plans are typically established
under collective bargaining agreements. Multi-employer retirement plans are generally governed by a
board of trustees composed of representatives of both management and labor and are generally funded
through employer contributions.
The Company’s expense for multi-employer retirement plans totaled $ 1million in both 2022 and 2021
and $ 2million in 2020. The plans we currently participate in have contractual arrangements that
extend into 2026. If, in the future, we choose to withdraw from any of the multi-employer retirement
plans in which we currently participate, we would record the appropriate withdrawal liability, if
any, at that time.

We made income tax payments of $ 2,403million, $ 2,168million and $ 1,268million in 2022, 2021 and
2020, respectively.
Our effective tax rate reflects the tax benefits of having significant operations outside the United
States, which are generally taxed at rates lower than the statutory U.S. federal tax rate. As a
result of employment actions and capital investments made by the Company, certain tax jurisdictions
provide income tax incentive grants, including Brazil, Costa Rica, Singapore and Eswatini. The terms
of these grants expire from 2025 to 2036. We anticipate that we will be able to extend or renew the
grants in these locations. Tax incentive grants favorably impacted our income tax expense by $
406million, $ 381million and $ 317million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020,
respectively. In addition, our effective tax rate reflects the benefits of having significant
earnings generated in investments accounted for under the equity method.
A reconciliation of the statutory U.S. federal tax rate and our effective tax rate is as follows:

primarily related to changes in judgment on specific tax positions due to the Opinion and amounts
required to be recorded for changes to other uncertain tax positions, including interest and
penalties. Also includes a tax benefit of $ 107million (or a 1.1percent impact on our effective tax
rate) related to changes in our assessment of certain valuation allowances and a net tax benefit of $
135million (or a 1.4percent impact on our effective tax rate) related to domestic return to provision
adjustments and other tax items.
5 Includes a tax benefit of $ 40million (or a 2.4percent impact on our effective tax rate) associated
with the $ 902million gain recorded upon the acquisition of the remaining ownership interest in
fairlife. Refer to Note 2.
As of December 31, 2022, we have not recorded incremental income taxes for additional outside basis
differences of $ 6.8billion in our investments in foreign subsidiaries, as these amounts continue to
be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. Determining the amount of unrecognized deferred tax
liability related to any additional outside basis differences in these entities is not practicable.
The Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (“GILTI”) provisions of the Tax Reform Act require the Company
to include in its U.S. income tax return each foreign subsidiary’s earnings in excess of an allowable
return on the foreign subsidiary’s tangible assets. An accounting policy election is available to
either account for the tax effects of GILTI in the period that is subject to such taxes or to provide
deferred taxes for book and tax basis differences that upon reversal may be subject to such taxes. We
have elected to account for the tax effects of these provisions in the period that is subject to such
tax and the impact is reflected in our full year provision.
The Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in all applicable jurisdictions, including
the U.S. federal jurisdiction, U.S. state jurisdictions and foreign jurisdictions. U.S. tax
authorities have completed their federal income tax examinations for all years prior to 2007. With
respect to U.S. state jurisdictions and foreign jurisdictions, with limited exceptions, the Company
and its subsidiaries are no longer subject to income tax audits for years prior to 2007. For U.S.
federal and state tax purposes, the net operating losses and tax credit carryovers that were acquired
in connection with our acquisition of Coca‑Cola Enterprises Inc.’s former North America business and
that were generated from 1990 through 2010 are subject to adjustments until the year in which they
are utilized is no longer subject to examination. Although the outcome of tax audits is always
uncertain, the Company believes that adequate amounts of tax, including interest and penalties, have
been provided for in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance.
 103 
On November 18, 2020, the Tax Court issued the Opinion regarding the Company’s 2015 litigation with
the IRS involving transfer pricing tax adjustments in which the court predominantly sided with the
IRS. The Company disagrees with the Opinion and intends to vigorously defend its position. Refer to
Note 11.
As of December 31, 2022, the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $ 926million. If the
Company were to prevail on all uncertain tax positions, the net effect would be a benefit of $
617million, exclusive of any benefits related to interest and penalties. The remaining $ 309million
primarily represents tax benefits that would be received in different tax jurisdictions in the event
the Company did not prevail on all uncertain tax positions.
A reconciliation of the changes in the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in

income taxes in our consolidated statement of income. The Company had $ 496million, $ 453million and
$ 391million in interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits accrued as of December
31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Of these amounts, expense of $ 43million, $ 62million and $
190million was recognized in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. If the Company were to prevail on all
uncertain tax positions, the reversal of this accrual would be a benefit to the Company’s effective
tax rate.
It is expected that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change in the next 12 months;
however, we do not expect any changes will have a significant impact on our consolidated statement of
income or consolidated balance sheet. These changes may be the result of settlements of ongoing
audits, statute of limitations expiring or final settlements in transfer pricing matters that are the
subject of litigation. Currently, an estimate of the range of the reasonably possible outcomes cannot
be made.

The tax effects of temporary differences and carryforwards that give rise to deferred tax assets and
liabilities consisted of the following (in millions):
 December 31, 2022 2021 
 ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── 
 Deferred tax assets:

 Other -211 -164 
 Total deferred tax liabilities $ -5,777 $ -5,629 
 Net deferred tax assets (liabilities) $ -1,168 $ -692 
As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had net deferred tax assets of $ 398million and $ 657million,
respectively, located in countries outside the United States.
As of December 31, 2022, we had $ 1,605million of loss carryforwards available to reduce future
taxable income. Loss carryforwards of $ 322million must be utilized within the next five years, and
the remainder can be utilized over a period greater than five years.
An analysis of our deferred tax asset valuation allowances is as follows (in millions):
 Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 
 ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── 
 Balance at beginning of year $ 401 $ 406 $ 303 
 Additions 47 25 240 
 Deductions -24 -30 -137 
 Balance at end of year $ 424 $ 401 $ 406 
The Company’s deferred tax asset valuation allowances are primarily the result of uncertainties
regarding the future realization of recorded tax benefits on tax loss carryforwards and foreign tax
credit carryforwards from operations in various jurisdictions and basis differences in certain equity
investments. Current evidence does not suggest that we will realize sufficient taxable income of the
appropriate character within the carryforward period to allow us to realize these deferred tax
benefits. If we were to identify and implement tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax
assets or generate sufficient income of the appropriate character in these jurisdictions in the
future, it could lead to the reversal of these valuation allowances and a reduction of income tax
expense. The Company believes that it will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the
tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets in our consolidated balance sheet.
In 2022, the Company recognized a net increase of $ 23million in its valuation allowances. The
increase was primarily due to significant negative evidence on the utilization of excess foreign tax
credits generated in the current year. The increase was also due to net increases in the deferred tax
assets and related valuation allowances on certain equity investments and the changes in net
operating losses in the normal course of business.
 105 
In 2021, the Company recognized a net decrease of $ 5million in its valuation allowances. The
decrease was primarily due to net decreases in the deferred tax assets and related valuation
allowances on certain equity investments and the changes in net operating losses in the normal course
of business.
In 2020, the Company recognized a net increase of $ 103million in its valuation allowances. The
increase was primarily due to net increases in the deferred tax assets and related valuation
allowances on certain equity investments. The increase was also due to the increase of valuation
allowances after considering significant negative evidence on the utilization of certain net
operating losses and excess foreign tax credits.

 NOTE 16: FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 
U.S. GAAP defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to
transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or
liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
Additionally, the inputs used to measure fair value are prioritized based on a three-level hierarchy.
This hierarchy requires entities to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of
unobservable inputs. The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:
• Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
• Level 2 — Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1. We value assets and
liabilities included in this level using dealer and broker quotations, certain pricing models, bid
prices, quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, or other inputs that are
observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.
• Level 3 — Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are
significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. This includes certain pricing models,
discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs.
 109 
Recurring Fair Value Measurements
In accordance with U.S. GAAP, certain assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair
value on a recurring basis. For our Company, the only assets and liabilities that are adjusted to
fair value on a recurring basis are investments in equity securities with readily determinable fair
values, debt securities classified as trading or available-for-sale, derivative financial instruments
and our contingent consideration liability. Additionally, the Company adjusts the carrying value of
certain long-term debt as a result of the Company’s fair value hedging strategy.
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities
The fair values of our investments in debt and equity securities using quoted market prices from
daily exchange traded markets are based on the closing price as of the balance sheet date and are
classified as Level 1. The fair values of our investments in debt and equity securities classified as
Level 2 are priced using quoted market prices for similar instruments or nonbinding market prices
that are corroborated by observable market data. Inputs into these valuation techniques include
actual trade data, benchmark yields, broker/dealer quotes and other similar data. These inputs are
obtained from quoted market prices, independent pricing vendors or other sources.
Derivative Financial Instruments
The fair values of our futures contracts are primarily determined using quoted contract prices on
futures exchange markets. The fair values of these instruments are based on the closing contract
prices as of the balance sheet date and are classified as Level 1.
The fair values of our derivative instruments other than futures are determined using standard
valuation models. The significant inputs used in these models are readily available in public
markets, or can be derived from observable market transactions, and therefore have been classified as
Level 2. Inputs used in these standard valuation models for derivative instruments other than futures
include the applicable exchange rates, forward rates, interest rates, discount rates and commodity
prices. The standard valuation model for options also uses implied volatility as an additional input.
The discount rates are based on the historical U.S. Deposit or U.S. Treasury rates, and the implied
volatility specific to options is based on quoted rates from financial institutions.
Included in the fair values of derivative instruments is an adjustment for nonperformance risk. The
adjustment is based on current credit default swap (“CDS”) rates applied to each contract, by
counterparty. We use our counterparty’s CDS rate when we are in an asset position and our own CDS
rate when we are in a liability position. The adjustment for nonperformance risk did not have a
significant impact on the estimated fair values of our derivative instruments.
The following tables summarize those assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring
basis (in millions):

line item other noncurrent liabilities. Refer to Note 5 for additional information related to the
composition of our derivatives portfolio.
Gross realized and unrealized gains and losses on Level 3 assets and liabilities, excluding the
contingent consideration liability, were not significant for the years ended December 31, 2022 and
2021.
The Company recognizes transfers between levels within the hierarchy as of the beginning of the
reporting period. Gross transfers between levels within the hierarchy were not significant for the
years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements
In addition to assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, the
Company records assets and liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as required by U.S.
GAAP. Generally, assets are recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as a result of impairment
charges or as a result of observable changes in equity securities using the measurement alternative.
 111 
The gains and losses on assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis are summarized in the
following table (in millions):
 Year Ended December 31, Gains (Losses) 2022 2021 
 ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── 
 Assets held for sale $ — $ -266 4 
 Other-than-temporary impairment charges -96 1 — 
 Impairment of intangible assets -57 2 -78 5 
 Valuation of shares in equity method -24 3 — 
 investee 
 Total $ -177 $ -344 
1 The Company recorded an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $ 96million during the year ended
December 31, 2022 related to an equity method investee in Russia. This impairment charge was derived
using Level 3 inputs and was primarily driven by revised projections of future operating results.
2 During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $ 57million
related to a trademark in Asia Pacific, which was primarily driven by a change in brand strategy
resulting in revised projections of future operating results for the trademark. The fair value of
this trademark was derived using discounted cash flow analyses based on Level 3 inputs.
3 During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized a net loss of $ 24million on assets measured
at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. The net loss was recorded as a result of an equity method
investee issuing additional shares of its stock. Accordingly, the Company is required to treat this
type of transaction as if the Company had sold a proportionate share of its investment. This net loss
was determined using Level 2 inputs and primarily resulted from the recognition of cumulative
translation losses.
4 The Company is required to record assets and liabilities that are held for sale at the lower of
carrying value or fair value less any costs to sell based on the agreed-upon sale price. The Company
recorded charges of $ 266million in the line item other income (loss) — net in our consolidated
statement of income related to the restructuring of our manufacturing operations in the United
States. These charges, which were calculated based on Level 3 inputs, primarily impacted the line
item property, plant and equipment in our consolidated balance sheet.
5 The Company recorded an impairment charge of $ 78million related to a trademark in Europe, which
was driven by a change in the long-term outlook on the licensing arrangement for a certain brand. The
fair value of this trademark was derived using discounted cash flow analyses based on Level 3 inputs.
Fair Value Measurements for Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets
The fair value hierarchy discussed above is not only applicable to assets and liabilities that are
included in our consolidated balance sheet but is also applied to certain other assets that impact
our consolidated financial statements. For example, our Company sponsors a number of pension and
other postretirement benefit plans. Assets contributed to these plans by the Company become the
property of the individual plans. Even though the Company no longer has control over these assets,
our consolidated financial statements are impacted by subsequent fair value adjustments to these
assets. The actual return on these assets impacts the Company’s future net periodic benefit cost or
income as well as amounts recognized in our consolidated balance sheet. Refer to Note 13. The Company
uses the fair value hierarchy to measure the fair value of assets held by our pension and other
postretirement benefit plans.
 112 
Pension Plan Assets
The following table summarizes the levels within the fair value hierarchy for our pension plan assets
(in millions):
 ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── 
1 Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its
equivalent) practical expedient have not been categorized in the fair value hierarchy but are
included to reconcile to the amounts presented in Note 13.
2 This class of assets includes investments in interest rate contracts, credit contracts and foreign
exchange contracts.
3 Includes purchased annuity insurance contracts.
4 This class of assets includes actively managed emerging markets equity funds and a collective trust
fund for qualified plans, invested primarily in equity securities of companies in developing and
emerging markets. There are no liquidity restrictions on these investments.
5 This class of assets includes hedge funds that can be subject to redemption restrictions, ranging
from monthly to semiannually, with a redemption notice period of up to one year and/or initial lock-
up periods of up to three years, and private equity funds that are primarily closed-end funds in
which the Company’s investments are generally not eligible for redemption. Distributions from these
private equity funds will be received as the underlying assets are liquidated or distributed.
6 This class of assets includes funds invested in real estate, including a privately held real estate
investment trust, a real estate commingled pension trust fund, infrastructure limited partnerships
and commingled investment funds. These funds seek current income and capital appreciation and can be
subject to redemption restrictions, ranging from quarterly to semiannually, with a redemption notice
period of up to 90 days.
7 Primarily includes segregated portfolios of private investment funds that are invested in a
portfolio of insurance-linked securities. These assets can be subject to a semiannual redemption,

transformed into a networked global organization designed to combine the power of scale with the deep
knowledge required to win locally. We created new operating units effective January 1, 2021, which
are focused on regional and local execution. The operating units sit under our four geographic
operating segments and are highly interconnected, with the goal of eliminating duplication of
resources and scaling new products more quickly. The operating units work closely with five global
marketing category leadership teams to rapidly scale ideas while staying close to the consumer. The
global marketing category leadership teams primarily focus on innovation as well as marketing
efficiency and effectiveness. The organizational structure also includes a center and a platform
services organization. Refer to Note 19 for additional information on our organizational structure.

 NOTE 19: OPERATING SEGMENTS 
Our organizational structure consists of the following operating segments: Europe, Middle East and
Africa; Latin America; North America; Asia Pacific; Global Ventures; and Bottling Investments. Our
operating structure also includes Corporate, which consists of two components: (1) a center focusing
on strategic initiatives, policy, governance and scaling global initiatives, and (2) a platform
services organization supporting operating units, global marketing category leadership teams and the
center by providing efficient and scaled global services and capabilities, including, but not limited
to, transactional work, data management, consumer analytics, digital commerce and social/digital
hubs.
Segment Products and Services
The business of our Company is primarily nonalcoholic beverages. Our geographic operating segments
(Europe, Middle East and Africa; Latin America; North America; and Asia Pacific) derive a majority of
their revenues from the manufacture and sale of beverage concentrates and syrups and, in some cases,
the sale of finished beverages. Our Global Ventures operating segment includes the results of our
Costa, innocent and doğadan businesses as well as fees earned pursuant to distribution coordination
agreements between the Company and Monster. Our Bottling Investments operating segment is composed of
our consolidated bottling operations, regardless of the geographic location of the bottler. Our
Bottling Investments operating segment also includes equity income from the majority of our equity
method investees. Our consolidated bottling operations derive the majority of their revenues from the
manufacture and sale of finished beverages. Generally, finished product operations produce higher net
operating revenues but lower gross profit margins than concentrate operations. Refer to Note 3.
The following table sets forth the percentage of total net operating revenues attributable to
concentrate operations and finished product operations:
 Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020

 Concentrate operations 56 % 56 % 56 % 
 Finished product operations 44 44 44 
 Total 100 % 100 % 100 % 
 118 
Method of Determining Segment Income or Loss
Management evaluates the performance of our operating segments separately to individually monitor the
different factors affecting financial performance. Our Company manages income taxes and certain
treasury-related items, such as interest income and interest expense, on a global basis within
Corporate. We evaluate operating segment performance based primarily on net operating revenues and
operating income (loss).

 REPORT OF MANAGEMENT 
Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements
Management of the Company is responsible for the preparation and integrity of the consolidated
financial statements appearing in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. The financial statements were
prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States appropriate
in the circumstances and, accordingly, include certain amounts based on our best judgments and
estimates. Financial information in this report is consistent with that in the financial statements.
Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of internal
controls and procedures to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Our internal control system
is supported by a program of internal audits and appropriate reviews by management, written policies
and guidelines, careful selection and training of qualified personnel, and a written Code of Business
Conduct adopted by our Company’s Board of Directors, applicable to all officers and employees of our
Company and subsidiaries. In addition, our Company’s Board of Directors adopted a written Code of
Business Conduct for Non-Employee Directors which reflects the same principles and values as our Code
of Business Conduct for officers and employees but focuses on matters of relevance to non-employee
Directors.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements and, even when determined to be effective, can only provide reasonable assurance
with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures
may deteriorate.
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control
over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 (“Exchange Act”). Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, management used the
criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013
Framework) (“COSO”) in Internal Control — Integrated Framework . Based on this assessment, management
believes that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2022.
The Company’s independent auditors, Ernst & Young LLP, a registered public accounting firm, are
appointed by the Audit Committee of our Company’s Board of Directors, subject to ratification by our
Company’s shareowners. Ernst & Young LLP has audited and reported on the consolidated financial
statements of The Coca-Cola Company and subsidiaries and the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting. The reports of the independent auditors are contained in this report.
 Audit Committee’s Responsibility 
The Audit Committee of our Company’s Board of Directors, composed solely of Directors who are
independent in accordance with the requirements of the New York Stock Exchange listing standards, the
Exchange Act, and the Company’s Corporate Governance Guidelines, meets with the independent auditors,
management and internal auditors periodically to discuss internal controls along with auditing and
financial reporting matters. The Audit Committee reviews with the independent auditors the scope and
results of the audit effort. The Audit Committee also meets periodically with the independent
auditors and the chief internal auditor without management present to ensure that the independent
auditors and the chief internal auditor have free access to the Audit Committee. Our Audit
Committee’s Report can be found in the Company’s 2023 Proxy Statement.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
To the Shareowners and the Board of Directors of The Coca-Cola Company
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Coca-Cola Company and
subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of
income, comprehensive income, shareowners’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated
financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report
dated February 21, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
 Basis for Opinion 
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is
to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public
accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the
Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations
of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing
procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to
error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures include
examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial
statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 Critical Audit Matters 
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of
the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee
and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2)
involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical
audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken
as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate
opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
 Accounting for uncertain tax positions 
 As described in Note 11 and Note 14 to the Company’s consolidated 
 financial statements, the Company is involved in various income tax 
 matters for which the ultimate outcomes are uncertain. As of 
 December 31, 2022, the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits was 
 $926 million. As described in Note 11, on September 17, 2015 the 
 Company received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency from the Internal 
 Revenue Service for the tax years 2007 through 2009 in the amount of 
 $3.3 billion for the period. On November 18, 2020, the U.S. Tax 
 Court issued an opinion predominantly siding with the IRS related to 
 the Company’s transfer pricing between its U.S. parent company and 
 certain of its foreign affiliates for tax years 2007 through 2009. 
 Description of the Matter While the Company continues to disagree with the IRS positions and 
 the portions of the opinion affirming such positions, it is possible 
 that some portion or all of the adjustment proposed by the IRS could 
 ultimately be upheld. As a result of the application of ASC 
 740,Accounting for Income Taxes, the Company has recorded a tax 
 reserve of $423 million for this matter as of December 31, 2022. 
 Auditing management’s evaluation of uncertain tax positions, 
 including the uncertain tax position associated with the IRS notice 
 and opinion, was especially challenging due to the level of 
 subjectivity and significant judgment associated with the 
 recognition and measurement of the tax positions that are more 
 likely than not to be sustained. 
 126 
 We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, 
 and tested the effectiveness of controls over the 
 Company’s accounting process for uncertain tax 
 positions. Our procedures included testing controls 
 addressing the completeness of uncertain tax 
 positions, controls relating to the identification 
 and recognition of the uncertain tax positions, 
 controls over the measurement of the unrecognized tax 
 benefit, and controls over the identification of 
 developments related to existing uncertain tax 
 positions. 
 Our audit procedures included, among others, 
 evaluating the assumptions the Company used to assess 
 its uncertain tax positions and related unrecognized 
 How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit tax benefit amounts by jurisdiction. We also tested 
 the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data 
 used in the identification and measurement of 
 uncertain tax positions. We evaluated evidence of 
 management’s assessment of the opinion, including 
 inquiries of tax counsel, inspection of technical 
 memos, and written representations of management. We 
 involved professionals with specialized skill and 
 knowledge to assist in our evaluation of the tax 
 technical merits of the Company’s assessment, 
 including the assessment of whether the tax positions 
 are more likely than not to be sustained, the amount 
 of the potential benefits to be realized, and the 
 application of relevant tax law. We also assessed the 
 Company’s disclosure of uncertain tax positions 
 included in Note 11 and Note 14. 
 Valuation of trademarks with indefinite lives and 
 goodwill 
 As described in Note 1 to the Company’s consolidated 
 financial statements, the Company performs an annual 
 impairment test ofits indefinite-lived intangible 
 assets, including trademarks with indefinite lives 
 and goodwill, or more frequently if events or 
 circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired. 
 Each impairment test may be qualitative or 
 quantitative. Trademarks with indefinite lives and 
 goodwill were $14.2 billion and $18.8 billion, 
 respectively, as of December 31, 2022. 
 Description of the Matter Auditing the valuation oftrademarks with indefinite 
 lives and reporting units with goodwill involved 
 complex judgment due to the significant estimation 
 required in determining the fair value of the 
 trademarks with indefinite lives and related 
 reporting units with goodwill, respectively. 
 Specifically, the fair value estimates were sensitive 
 to significant assumptions about future market and 
 economic conditions. Significant assumptions used in 
 the Company’s fair value estimates included sales 
 volume, pricing, royalty rates, long-term growth 
 rates, and cost of capital, as applicable. 
 We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, 
 and tested the operating effectiveness of controls 
 over the Company’s annual impairment tests for 
 trademarks with indefinite lives and reporting units 
 with goodwill. For example, we tested management’s 
 risk assessment process to determine whether to 
 perform a quantitative or qualitative test and 
 management’s review controls over the valuation 
 models and underlying assumptions used to develop 
 such estimates. For impairment tests of reporting 
 units with goodwill, we also tested controls over the 
 determination of the carrying value of the reporting 
 units. We tested the estimated fair values of the 
 trademarks with indefinite lives and reporting units 
 with goodwill based on our risk assessments. 
 Our audit procedures included, among others, 
 How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit comparing significant judgmental inputs to observable 
 third party and industry sources, considering other 
 observable market transactions, and evaluating the 
 reasonableness of management’s projected financial 
 information by comparing to third party industry 
 projections, third party economic growth projections, 
 and other internal and external data. We performed 
 sensitivity analyses of certain significant 
 assumptions to evaluate the change in the fair value 
 of the trademarks with indefinite lives and reporting 
 units with goodwill and also assessed the historical 
 accuracy of management’s estimates. In addition, we 
 involved specialists to assist in our evaluation of 
 certain significant assumptions used in the Company’s 
 discounted cash flow analyses. We also assessed the 
 Company’s disclosure of its annual impairment tests 
 included in Note 1.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
To the Shareowners and the Board of Directors of The Coca-Cola Company
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited The Coca-Cola Company and subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO
criteria). In our opinion, The Coca-Cola Company and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based
on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2022
and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareowners’ equity,
and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related
notes and our report dated February 21, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
 Basis for Opinion 
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be
independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the
applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing
the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as
we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,
use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
