Sensitivity analysis demonstrates how small variations in key valuation assumptions affect an output, such as equity value or share price. When valuing a company using discounted cash flow, sensitivity analysis helps investors understand the range of possible outcomes and identify which assumptions matter most. It can also be applied to valuation multiples like EV/EBITDA or P/E. Sensitivity analysis is especially useful in industries where assumptions about growth, discount rate, margins, or terminal value carry uncertainty. It is less critical in ultra-stable utilities, but very useful for software, consumer discretionary, industrial, or energy companies where guidance, macro effects, or sentiment may shift assumptions.
In the following examples, I use fictional data modeled after a large software company named AcmeSoft. I assume you have access to earnings releases, 10-K data, balance sheet, income statement, cash flow data, and sentiment commentary. Base case assumptions are drawn from those sources. Then I vary one assumption at a time. I calculate how equity value and implied share price change. I describe when this method is used and why it matters.
Base case data for AcmeSoft is as follows. The companyâ€™s income statement shows net revenue of 10 billion dollars in the latest twelve months, operating margin of 25 percent, free cash flow conversion ratio of 80 percent of net income. Balance sheet shows net debt of 2 billion. Shares outstanding are 200 million. Cost of capital (WACC) is estimated at 8 percent. Terminal growth rate is assumed at 2.5 percent. Consensus sentiment from earnings calls is neutral to modestly positive.
Using this base case, implied enterprise value is derived by building a simple DCF with five year cash flow forecasts. For simplicity, free cash flow in year one is revenue growth of 6 percent, margin trends stable, cash flow conversion ratio holds. The present value of those free cash flows plus terminal value yields enterprise value of 50 billion. Subtract net debt of 2 billion yields equity value of 48 billion. Divided by 200 million shares gives base case implied price of 240 dollars.
Now I perform five sensitivity runs, each varying one input while holding everything else constant.
Sensitivity example one varies WACC plus or minus 1 percentage point. Lower WACC increases present values, higher WACC reduces them. If WACC is 7 percent instead of 8, then present value of cash flows and terminal value yields enterprise value of 55 billion, equity value of 53 billion, share price of 265. If WACC is 9 percent, enterprise value drops to 45 billion, equity value of 43 billion, share price of 215. This illustrates how cost of capital assumptions impact valuation. This method is widely used when cost of capital uncertainty exists. It works best for companies in sectors where investors rely heavily on discount rate assumptions, such as software, consumer durables, or industrials with moderate growth.
Sensitivity example two varies revenue growth in forecast period. Base case growth is 6 percent per year for five years. If growth is 5 percent, year one free cash flow is lower, terminal value lower. Present value and equity value drop. In that scenario, enterprise value becomes 48 billion, equity value 46 billion, share price 230. If growth is 7 percent, enterprise value becomes 52.5 billion, equity 50.5 billion, share price 252. So a one point shift in growth changes value by plus or minus roughly 10 percent. This is most relevant in high-growth or sentiment-driven sectors where guidance and sentiment may shift expectations.
Sensitivity example three varies the terminal growth rate g. Base terminal rate is 2.5 percent. If terminal rate is 2 percent, enterprise value falls to 48.5 billion, equity value to 46.5 billion, price of 232. If terminal rate is 3 percent, enterprise value increases to 51.5 billion, equity value to 49.5 billion, price of 247. This shows that terminal assumption drives a large portion of value. It is especially relevant for companies expected to generate stable cash flow indefinitely, such as subscription software firms or utilities with sticky margins.
Sensitivity example four varies the free cash flow conversion ratio, representing reinvestment and working capital needs. Base ratio is 80 percent of net income. If conversion ratio is 70 percent, meaning more earnings are tied up in capex or working capital, free cash flow is lower. That scenario yields enterprise value of 48 billion, equity value of 46 billion, price of 230. If conversion ratio is 90 percent, enterprise value rises to 52 billion, equity to 50 billion, price of 250. This input is relevant for capital-intensive industries or companies with changing capital expenditure cycles, like telecom or manufacturing, but also matter for software with unusual growth capex.
Sensitivity example five varies implied terminal exit multiple in an exit-multiple formulation instead of growth rate. Assume instead of perpetuity method you apply an EV/EBITDA multiple at year five. Base case EBITDA year five is projected at 3.5 billion dollars. If comparable multiples average 12 times, terminal value is 42 billion. If multiples fall to 11 times, terminal value is 38.5 billion; if multiples rise to 13 times, terminal value is 45.5 billion. Discounting and equity adjustments yield share price of 225 in the low multiple case, share price of 255 in the high multiple case. This method is common when sentiment around multiples is shifting or comps are unclear, such as cyclical sectors or M&A environments.
