FINANCIAL REPORTING MECHANICS
Analyzing financial statements requires understanding how a company’s transactions are recorded. Key concepts include the financial statement elements (assets, liabilities, equity, revenues, and expenses) and classifying any account accordingly. One must also understand the basic and expanded accounting equations, why every transaction must be recorded in at least two accounts, the types of accruals, their usage, how account changes impact financial statements, and how the statements relate to one another.
Business activities are classified into operating, investing, or financing. Operating activities occur in the normal course of business—producing and selling goods or services. Investing activities involve buying or selling long-term assets like land or machinery. Financing includes issuing or redeeming debt, issuing or repurchasing stock, and paying dividends.
How activities are classified depends on the firm’s nature. For example, interest received is typically investing for a manufacturer but operating for a financial services firm.
Note: While these classifications are used in the statement of cash flows, they are defined differently here. Because the names are the same (operating, investing, financing), context is essential.
Financial statement elements include major categories: assets, liabilities, owners’ equity, revenues, and expenses. Accounts are specific records within each element. A chart of accounts lists all such entries. Contra accounts reduce values of other accounts, such as “accumulated depreciation” which offsets “equipment.”
Classifying accounts into elements
Assets are economic resources, such as:
	•	Cash and cash equivalents (including securities maturing in 90 days or less)
	•	Accounts receivable (may include allowance for doubtful accounts)
	•	Inventory
	•	Financial assets (e.g., marketable securities)
	•	Prepaid expenses (recognized later on income statements)
	•	Property, plant, and equipment (PPE), with accumulated depreciation
	•	Equity investments using the equity method
	•	Deferred tax assets
	•	Intangible assets (e.g., patents, goodwill; amortized except goodwill)
Liabilities are creditor claims, including:
	•	Accounts payable and trade payables
	•	Short-term notes payable
	•	Unearned revenue (to be recognized as revenue later)
	•	Income taxes payable
	•	Long-term debt (e.g., bonds payable)
	•	Deferred tax liabilities
Owners’ equity is the residual claim (assets – liabilities), including:
	•	Capital (par value of stock)
	•	Additional paid-in capital (excess of issuance price over par)
	•	Treasury stock (repurchased shares, a contra-equity account)
	•	Retained earnings (cumulative net income not paid as dividends)
	•	Other comprehensive income (e.g., currency translation, unrealized gains/losses)
Revenue includes:
	•	Sales revenue from core business operations
	•	Gains from incidental activities
	•	Investment income (e.g., dividends, interest)
Expenses include:
	•	Cost of goods sold (COGS)
	•	Selling, general, and administrative expenses (e.g., salaries, rent)
	•	Depreciation and amortization
	•	Tax expense
	•	Interest expense
	•	Losses from incidental activities
Accounting Equation
The basic equation:
Assets = Liabilities + Owners’ Equity
Expanded form:
Assets = Liabilities + Contributed Capital + Ending Retained Earnings
And including income components:
Assets = Liabilities + Contributed Capital + Beginning Retained Earnings + Revenue – Expenses – Dividends
Double-entry accounting keeps the equation balanced. Each transaction affects at least two accounts.
Examples:
	•	Buy equipment for $10,000 cash: increase PPE, decrease cash.
	•	Borrow $10,000 for equipment: increase PPE and notes payable.
	•	Buy $100 in office supplies: decrease cash, increase supply expense (reduces equity).
	•	Buy inventory for $8,000 and sell for $10,000: inventory and cash change, record revenue and COGS, equity increases by $2,000.
Accrual Accounting
Revenues and expenses are recorded when earned or incurred, not when cash changes hands.
Types of accruals:
	1.	Unearned revenue: Cash received before service. Increases unearned revenue (liability), then reclassified as revenue when earned.
	2.	Accrued revenue: Goods/services delivered before cash received. Increases revenue and accounts receivable.
	3.	Prepaid expenses: Cash paid before expense. Shifts from asset to expense as used.
	4.	Accrued expenses: Expense incurred before cash paid. Increases expense and liability (e.g., wages payable).
Accrual entries ensure revenues and expenses are recognized in the correct period.
Valuation Adjustments
Though assets are often recorded at historical cost, some must reflect market value. These adjustments impact equity via income or other comprehensive income.
Financial Statements
Figures in financial statements include:
	•	Balance sheet: financial position at period-end
	•	Income statement, cash flow statement, and statement of owners’ equity: changes over the period
Key relationships:
	•	Net income = $37,500; Dividends = $8,500; Increase in retained earnings = $29,000
	•	Retained earnings rose from $30,000 to $59,000
	•	Cash increased by $24,000 (from $9,000 to $33,000)
	•	Stock repurchase ($10,000) reflected in common stock decrease (from $50,000 to $40,000)
	•	Owners’ equity rose by $19,000, matching retained earnings increase minus stock repurchase

Information flows through an accounting system in four steps:
	1.	Journal entries record all transactions, showing which accounts are affected and by how much. A list of these entries in date order is called the general journal.
	2.	The general ledger organizes journal entries by account.
	3.	At the end of the accounting period, an initial trial balance is prepared showing the balances in each account. Adjusting entries are recorded and reflected in the adjusted trial balance if needed.
	4.	Account balances from the adjusted trial balance are used to prepare the financial statements.
An analyst does not see the internal accounting process, only the final financial statements. To analyze properly, the analyst must understand the accruals, adjustments, and managerial assumptions behind the numbers. Much of this detail is in the footnotes and in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis section. Reviewing this content helps the analyst assess how well the statements reflect actual performance and whether adjustments are needed.
Because management has discretion over some of the accounting estimates and assumptions, there is potential for earnings manipulation or misrepresentation. A strong understanding of accounting mechanics helps analysts spot entries that seem unusual or inconsistent with normal expectations.
Business activities are classified as oPErating activities if they are part of a firm's
ordinary business, investing activities if they involve buying or disposing of long-term
assets, or financing activities if they are to issue or repay debt, issue or repurchase
stock, or pay cash dividends.
Transactions are recorded in accounts that form the financial statement elements:
Assets--the firm's economic resources.
Liabilities--creditors' claims on the firm's resources.
Owners' equity--paid-in capital (common and preferred stock), retained
earnings, and cumulative other comprehensive income.
Revenues--sales, investment income, and gains.
ExPEnses--cost of goods sold, selling and administrative exPEnses,
depreciation, interest, taxes, and losses.
The basic accounting equation:
assets = liabilities + owners' equity
The expanded accounting equation:
assets = liabilities + contributed capital + ending retained earnings
The expanded accounting equation can also be stated as:
assets = liabilities + contributed capital + beginning retained earnings + revenue
- exPEnses - dividends
Keeping the accounting equation (A - L = E) in balance requires double entry
accounting, in which a transaction is recorded in at least two accounts. An increase in
an asset account, for example, must be balanced by a decrease in another asset
account or by an increase in a liability or owners' equity account.
A firm must recognize revenues when they are earned and exPEnses when they are
incurred. Accruals are required when the timing of cash payments made and received
does not match the timing of the revenue or exPEnse recognition on the financial
statements.
The balance sheet shows a company's financial position at a point in time.
Changes in balance sheet accounts during an accounting PEriod are reflected in the
income statement, the cash flow statement, and the statement of owners' equity.
Information enters an accounting system as journal entries, which are sorted by
account into a general ledger. Trial balances are formed at the end of an accounting
PEriod. Accounts are then adjusted and presented in financial statements.
Since financial reporting requires choices of method, judgment, and estimates, an
analyst must understand the accounting process used to produce the financial
statements in order to understand the business and the results for the PEriod. Analysts
should be alert to the use of accruals, changes in valuations, and other notable
changes that may indicate management judgment is incorrect or, worse, that the
financial statements have been deliberately manipulated.
CONCEPT CHECKERS
This topic review covers accounting standards: why they exist, who issues them, and
who enforces them. Know the difference between the roles of private standard-setting
bodies and government regulatory authorities and be able to name the most
important organizations of both kinds. Become familiar with the framework for
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), including qualitative characteristics,
constraints and assumptions, and features for preparing financial statements. Be able
to identiFY barriers to convergence of national accounting standards (such as U.S.
GAAP) with IFRS, key differences between the IFRS and U.S. GAAP frameworks, and
elements of and barriers to creating a coherent financial reporting network.
financial reporting standards in SECurity analysis and valuation.
According to the IASB Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting 2010, the
objective of financial reporting is to provide information about the firm to current and
potential investors and creditors that is useful for making their decisions about
investing in or lending to the firm.
The conceptual framework is used in the development of accounting standards. Given
the variety and complexity of possible transactions and the estimates and assumptions
a firm must make when presenting its PErformance, financial statements could
potentially take any form if reporting standards did not exist. Thus, financial reporting
standards are needed to provide consistency by narrowing the range of acceptable
responses.
Reporting standards ensure that transactions are reported by firms similarly. However,
standards must remain flexible and allow discretion to management to proPErly
describe the economics of the firm.
Financial reporting is not designed solely for valuation purposes; however, it does
provide important inputs for valuation purposes.
standards, and describe the role of the International Organization of SECurities
Commissions.
Standard-setting bodies are professional organizations of accountants and auditors
that establish financial reporting standards. Regulatory authorities are government
agencies that have the legal authority to enforce compliance with financial reporting
standards.
The two primary standard-setting bodies are the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(FASB) and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). In the United States,
the FASB sets forth Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Outside the
United States, the IASB establishes International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).
Other national standard-setting bodies exist as well. Many of them (including the
FASB) are working toward convergence with IFRS. Some of the older IASB standards
are referred to as International Accounting Standards (IAS).
Desirable attributes of standard-setters:
Observe high professional standards.
Have adequate authority, resources, and comPEtencies to accomplish its
mission.
Have clear and consistent standard-setting processes.
Guided by a well-articulated framework.
OPErate indePEndently while still seeking input from stakeholders.
Should not be compromised by sPEcial interests.
Decisions are made in the public interest.
Regulatory authorities, such as the SECurities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the
United States and the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom, are
established by national governments. Figure 1 summarizes the SEC's filing
requirements for publicly traded companies in the United States. These filings, which
are available from the SEC Web site (www.SEC.gov), are arguably the most important
source of information for the analysis of publicly traded firms.
Most national authorities belong to the International Organization of SECurities
Commissions (IOSCO). The three objectives of financial market regulation according to
IOSCO1 are to (1) protect investors; (2) ensure the fairness, efficiency, and
transparency of markets; and (3) reduce systemic risk. Because of the increasing
globalization of SECurities markets, IOSCO has a goal of uniform financial regulations
across countries.
Figure 1: SECurities and Exchange Commission Required Filings
Form S-1. Registration statement filed prior to the sale of new SECurities to the
public. The registration statement includes audited financial statements, risk
assessment, underwriter identification, and the estimated amount and use of
the offering proceeds.
Form 10-K. Required annual filing that includes information about the business
and its management, audited financial statements and disclosures, and
disclosures about legal matters involving the firm. Information required in Form
10-K is similar to that which a firm typically provides in its annual report to
shareholders. However, a firm's annual report is not a substitute for the
required 10-K filing. Equivalent SEC forms for foreign issuers in the U.S. markets
are Form 40-F for Canadian companies and Form 20-F for other foreign issuers.
Form 10-Q. U.S. firms are required to file this form quarterly, with updated
financial statements (unlike Form 10-K, these statements do not have to be
audited) and disclosures about certain events such as significant legal
proceedings or changes in accounting policy. Non-U.S. companies are typically
required to file the equivalent Form 6-K semiannually.
Form DEF-14A. When a company prepares a proxy statement for its
shareholders prior to the annual meeting or other shareholder vote, it also files
the statement with the SEC as Form DEF-14A.
Form 8-K. Companies must file this form to disclose material events including
significant asset acquisitions and disposals, changes in management or
corporate governance, or matters related to its accountants, its financial
statements, or the markets in which its SECurities trade.
Form 144. A company can issue SECurities to certain qualified buyers without
registering the SECurities with the SEC but must notiFY the SEC that it intends to
do so.
Forms 3, 4, and 5 involve the beneficial ownership of SECurities by a company's
officers and directors. Analysts can use these filings to learn about purchases
and sales of company SECurities by corporate insiders.
ongoing barriers to developing one universally accepted set of financial reporting
standards.
The EuroPEan Union requires IFRS financial reporting by publicly listed companies. In
most major countries that have not fully adopted IFRS, accounting standard setters are
attempting to converge their standards with IFRS. Many asPEcts of U.S. GAAP and IFRS,
for example, have converged over the past decade, and the SECurities and Exchange
Commission no longer requires IFRS reporting firms to reconcile their financial
statements to U.S. GAAP. IFRS convergence efforts are also ongoing in Japan, China,
and many other countries.
One barrier to convergence (developing one universally accepted set of accounting
standards) is simply that different standard-setting bodies and the regulatory
authorities of different countries can and do disagree on the best treatment of a
particular item or issue. Other barriers result from the political pressures that
regulatory bodies face from business groups and others who will be affected by
changes in reporting standards.
framework, including the objective and qualitative characteristics of financial
statements, required reporting elements, and constraints and assumptions in
preparing financial statements.
The ideas on which the IASB bases its standards are expressed in the "Conceptual
Framework for Financial Reporting" that the organization adopted in 2010. The IASB
framework details the qualitative characteristics of financial statements and sPEcifies
the required reporting elements. The framework also notes certain constraints and
assumptions that are involved in financial statement preparation.
At the center of the IASB Conceptual Framework is the objective to provide financial
information that is useful in making decisions about providing resources to an entity.
The resource providers include investors, lenders, and other creditors. Users of
financial statements need information about the firm's PErformance, financial
position, and cash flow.
Qualitative Characteristics
There are two fundamental characteristics that make financial information useful:
relevance and faithful representation.2
Relevance. Financial statements are relevant if the information in them can
influence users' economic decisions or affect users' evaluations of past events
or forecasts of future events. To be relevant, information should have predictive
value, confirmatory value (confirm prior exPEctations), or both. Materiality is an
asPEct of relevance.3
Faithful representation. Information that is faithfully representative is complete,
neutral (ABSence of bias), and free from error.
There are four characteristics that enhance relevance and faithful representation:
comparability, verifiability, timeliness, and understandability.
Comparability. Financial statement presentation should be consistent among
firms and across time PEriods.
Verifiability. IndePEndent observers, using the same methods, obtain similar
results.
Timeliness. Information is available to decision makers before the information is
stale.
Understandability. Users with a basic knowledge of business and accounting and
who make a reasonable effort to study the financial statements should be able
to readily understand the information the statements present. Useful
information should not be omitted just because it is complicated.
Required Reporting Elements
The elements of financial statements are the by-now familiar groupings of assets,
liabilities, and owners' equity (for measuring financial position) and income and
exPEnses (for measuring PErformance). The Conceptual Framework describes each of
these elements:4
Assets. Resources controlled as a result of past transactions that are exPEcted to
provide future economic benefits.
Liabilities. Obligations as a result of past events that are exPEcted to require an
outflow of economic resources.
Equity. The owners' residual interest in the assets after deducting the liabilities.
Income. An increase in economic benefits, either increasing assets or decreasing
liabilities in a way that increases owners' equity (but not including contributions
by owners). Income includes revenues and gains.
ExPEnses. Decreases in economic benefits, either decreasing assets or
increasing liabilities in a way that decreases owners' equity (but not including
distributions to owners). Losses are included in exPEnses.
An item should be recognized in its financial statement element if a future economic
benefit from the item (flowing to or from the firm) is probable and the item's value or
cost can be measured reliably.
The amounts at which items are reported in the financial statement elements dePEnd
on their measurement base. Measurement bases include historical cost (the amount
originally paid for the asset), amortized cost (historical cost adjusted for depreciation,
amortization, depletion, and impairment), current cost (the amount the firm would
have to pay today for the same asset), net realizable value (the estimated selling price
of the asset in the normal course of business minus the selling costs), present value
(the discounted value of the asset's exPEcted future cash flows), and fair value (the
price at which an asset could be sold, or a liability transferred, in an orderly transaction
between willing parties).
Professor's Note: In the next Study Sessions, we will discuss these measurement bases in more detail
and the situations in which each is appropriate.
Constraints and Assumptions
According to the Conceptual Framework, there is cost-benefit tradeoff of
the enhancing characteristics.5 Accordingly, the benefit that users gain
from the information should be greater than the cost of presenting it. Another
constraint, not sPEcifically mentioned in the Conceptual Framework, is the fact that
non-quantifiable information about a company (its reputation, brand loyalty, capacity
for innovation, etc.) cannot be captured directly in financial statements.
Two important underlying assumptions of financial statements are accrual accounting
and going concern.6 Accrual accounting means that financial statements should reflect
transactions at the time they actually occur, not necessarily when cash is paid. Going
concern assumes the company will continue to exist for the foreseeable future. If this
is not the case, then presenting the company's financial position fairly requires a
number of adjustments (e.g., its inventory or other assets may only be worth their
liquidation values).
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).
International Accounting Standard (IAS) No. 1 defines which financial statements are
required and how they must be presented. The required financial statements are:
Balance sheet (statement of financial position).
Statement of comprehensive income.
Cash flow statement.
Statement of changes in owners' equity.
Explanatory notes, including a summary of accounting policies.
The general features for preparing financial statements are stated in IAS No. 1:
Fair presentation, defined as faithfully representing the effects of the entity's
transactions and events according to the standards for recognizing assets,
liabilities, revenues, and exPEnses.
Going concern basis, meaning the financial statements are based on the
assumption that the firm will continue to exist unless its management intends
to (or must) liquidate it.
Accrual basis of accounting is used to prepare the financial statements other
than the statement of cash flows.
Consistency between PEriods in how items are presented and classified, with
prior-PEriod amounts disclosed for comparison.
Materiality, meaning the financial statements should be free of misstatements
or omissions that could influence the decisions of users of financial statements.
Aggregation of similar items and separation of dissimilar items.
No offsetting of assets against liabilities or income against exPEnses unless a
sPEcific standard PErmits or requires it.
Reporting frequency must be at least annually.
Comparative information for prior PEriods should be included unless a sPEcific
standard states otherwise.
Also stated in IAS No. 1 are the structure and content of financial statements:
Most entities should present a classified balance sheet showing current and
noncurrent assets and liabilities.
Minimum information is required on the face of each financial statement and in
the notes. For example, the face of the balance sheet must show sPEcific items
such as cash and cash equivalents, plant, proPErty and equipment, and
inventories. Items listed on the face of the comprehensive income statement
must include revenue, profit or loss, tax exPEnse, and finance costs, among
others.
Comparative information for prior PEriods should be included unless a sPEcific
standard states otherwise.
U.S. GAAP consists of standards issued by the FASB, along with numerous other
pronouncements and interpretations. Like the IASB, the FASB has a framework for
preparing and presenting financial statements. The two organizations have made
significant progress toward a common framework, but the two frameworks still differ
in several resPEcts.
The IASB framework lists income and exPEnses as elements related to
PErformance, while the FASB framework includes revenues, exPEnses, gains,
losses, and comprehensive income.
The FASB defines an asset as a future economic benefit, whereas the IASB
defines it as a resource from which a future economic benefit is exPEcted to
flow. Also, the FASB uses the word probable in its definition of assets and
liabilities.
The FASB does not allow the upward valuation of most assets.
Analysts will need to interpret financial statements that are prepared under different
standards. In many cases, however, a company will present a reconciliation statement
showing what its financial results would have been under an alternative reporting
system. For example, firms that list their shares in the United States but do not use
U.S. GAAP or IFRS are required to reconcile their financial statements with U.S. GAAP.
For IFRS firms listing their shares in the United States, reconciliation is no longer
required.
Even if a unified framework emerges, sPEcial reporting standards that apply to
particular industries (e.g., insurance and banking) will continue to exist.
LOS 23.g: IdentiFY characteristics of a coherent financial reporting framework and the
barriers to creating such a framework.
A coherent financial reporting framework is one that fits together logically. Such a
framework should be transparent, comprehensive, and consistent.
Transparency--Full disclosure and fair presentation reveal the underlying
economics of the company to the financial statement user.
Comprehensiveness--All tyPEs of transactions that have financial implications
should be part of the framework, including new tyPEs of transactions that
emerge.
Consistency--Similar transactions should be accounted for in similar ways
across companies, geographic areas, and time PEriods.
Barriers to creating a coherent financial reporting framework include issues related to
valuation, standard setting, and measurement.
Valuation--Measurement bases for valuation that require little judgment, such
as historical cost, may be less relevant than a basis like fair value that requires
more judgment.
Standard setting--Three appROAches to standard setting are a "principlesbased" appROAch that relies on a bROAd framework, a "rules-based" appROAch
that gives sPEcific guidance about how to classiFY transactions, and an
"objectives-oriented" appROAch that blends the other two appROAches. IFRS is
largely a principles-based appROAch. U.S. GAAP has traditionally been more
rules-based, but the common conceptual framework is moving toward an
objectives-oriented appROAch.
Measurement--Another trade-off in financial reporting is between proPErly
valuing the elements at one point in time (as on the balance sheet) and proPErly
valuing the changes between points in time (as on the income statement). An
"asset/liability" appROAch, which standard setters have largely used, focuses on
balance sheet valuation. A "revenue/exPEnse" appROAch would tend to place
more significance on the income statement.
systems and the importance of monitoring developments in financial reporting
standards.
As financial reporting standards continue to evolve, analysts need to monitor how
these developments will affect the financial statements they use. An analyst should be
aware of new products and innovations in the financial markets that generate new
tyPEs of transactions. These might not fall neatly into the existing financial reporting
standards. The analyst can use the financial reporting framework as a guide for
evaluating what effect new products or transactions might have on financial
statements.
Finally, analysts must monitor company disclosures for significant accounting
standards and estimates.
Companies that prepare financial statements under IFRS or U.S. GAAP must disclose
their accounting policies and estimates in the footnotes. Significant policies and
estimates that require management judgement are also addressed in Management's
Discussion and Analysis (management commentary). An analyst should use these
disclosures to evaluate what policies are discussed, whether they cover all the relevant
data in the financial statements, which policies required management to make
estimates, and whether the disclosures and estimates have changed since the prior
PEriod.
Another disclosure that is required for public companies is the likely impact of
implementing recently issued accounting standards. Management can discuss the
impact of adopting a new standard, conclude that the standard does not apply or will
not affect the financial statements materially, or state that they are still evaluating the
effects of the new standards. Analysts should be aware of the uncertainty this last
statement implies.
KEY CONCEPTS
The objective of financial statements is to provide economic decision makers with useful information about a firm’s financial performance and changes in financial position.
Reporting standards are designed to ensure that different firms’ statements are comparable to one another and to narrow the range of reasonable estimates on which financial statements are based. This aids users of the financial statements who rely on them for information about the company’s activities, profitability, and creditworthiness.
Standard-setting bodies are private sector organizations that establish financial reporting standards. The two primary standard-setting bodies are the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and, in the United States, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB).
Regulatory authorities are government agencies that enforce compliance with financial reporting standards. Regulatory authorities include the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the United States and the Financial Services Authority (FSA) in the United Kingdom. Many national regulatory authorities belong to the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO).
Efforts to achieve convergence of local accounting standards with IFRS are underway in most major countries that have not adopted IFRS.
Barriers to developing one universally accepted set of financial reporting standards include differences of opinion among standard-setting bodies and regulatory authorities from different countries and political pressure within countries from groups affected by changes in reporting standards.
The IFRS “Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting” defines the fundamental and enhancing qualitative characteristics of financial statements, specifies the required reporting elements, and notes the constraints and assumptions involved in preparing financial statements.
The fundamental characteristics of financial statements are relevance and faithful representation. The enhancing characteristics include comparability, verifiability, timeliness, and understandability.
Elements of financial statements are assets, liabilities, and owners’ equity (for measuring financial position) and income and expenses (for measuring performance).
Constraints on financial statement preparation include cost versus benefit and the difficulty of capturing non-quantifiable information in financial statements.
The two primary assumptions that underlie the preparation of financial statements are the accrual basis and the going concern assumption.
Required financial statements are the balance sheet, comprehensive income statement, cash flow statement, statement of changes in owners’ equity, and explanatory notes.
The general features of financial statements according to IAS No. 1 are: fair presentation, going concern, accrual accounting, consistency, materiality, aggregation, no offsetting, reporting frequency, and comparative information.
Other presentation requirements include a classified balance sheet and specific minimum information that must be reported in the notes and on the face of the financial statements.
The IASB and FASB frameworks are similar but are moving towards convergence. Some of the remaining differences are:
The IASB lists income and expenses as performance elements, while the FASB lists revenues, expenses, gains, losses, and comprehensive income.
There are minor differences in the definition of assets. Also, the FASB uses the word probable when defining assets and liabilities.
The FASB does not allow the upward revaluation of most assets.
Firms that list their shares in the United States but do not use U.S. GAAP or IFRS are required to reconcile their financial statements with U.S. GAAP. For IFRS firms listing their shares in the United States, reconciliation is no longer required.
A coherent financial reporting framework should exhibit transparency, comprehensiveness, and consistency.
Barriers to creating a coherent framework include issues of valuation, standard setting, and measurement.
An analyst should be aware of evolving financial reporting standards and new products and innovations that generate new types of transactions.
Under IFRS and U.S. GAAP, companies must disclose their accounting policies and estimates in the footnotes and MD&A. Public companies are also required to disclose the likely impact of recently issued accounting standards on their financial statements.
