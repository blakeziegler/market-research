FINANCIAL REPORTING MECHANICS
Study Session 6
EXAM FOCUS
The analysis of financial statements requires an understanding of how a company's
transactions are recorded in the various accounts. Candidates should focus on the
financial statement elements (assets, liabilities, equity, revenues, and exPEnses) and
be able to classiFY any account into its appropriate element. Candidates should also
learn the basic and expanded accounting equations and why every transaction must be
recorded in at least two accounts. The tyPEs of accruals, when each of them is used,
how changes in accounts affect the financial statements, and the relationships among
the financial statements, are all important topics.
LOS 22.a: Describe how business activities are classified for financial reporting
purposes.
CFA(r) Program Curriculum, Volume 3, page 44
Business activities can be classified as oPErating, investing, or financing activities.
OPErating activities are those undertaken in a firm's ordinary course of business, such
as producing and selling goods and services. Investing activities refer to buying or
selling long-term assets, such as machinery or land. Financing activities refer to issuing
debt (borrowing money), redeeming debt (repaying money), issuing common stock,
repurchasing common stock, or paying cash dividends.
How an activity is classified dePEnds on the nature of the firm. For example, receiving
interest payments on debt is likely to be classified as an investing activity by a
manufacturing firm, but likely to be classified as an oPErating activity by a financial
services firm.
Professor's Note: These same classifications are used on the statement of cash flows, but they
are defined differently than business activities are defined here. Because the classification names
(oPErating, investing, and financing) are the same, candidates must be careful to understand the
context in which these classifications are used.
LOS 22.b: Explain the relationship of financial statement elements and accounts, and
classiFY accounts into the financial statement elements.
CFA(r) Program Curriculum, Volume 3, page 46
Financial statement elements are the major classifications of assets, liabilities, owners'
equity, revenues, and exPEnses. Accounts are the sPEcific records within each element
where various transactions are entered. On the financial statements, accounts are
typically presented in groups such as "inventory" or "accounts payable." A company's
chart of accounts is a detailed list of the accounts that make up the five financial
statement elements and the line items presented in the financial statements.
Contra accounts are used for entries that offset some part of the value of another
account. For example, equipment is typically valued on the balance sheet at acquisition
(historical) cost, and the estimated decrease in its value over time is recorded in a
contra account titled "accumulated depreciation."
ClassiFYing Accounts Into the Financial Statement Elements
Assets are the firm's economic resources. Examples of assets include:
Cash and cash equivalents. Liquid SECurities with maturities of 90 days or less
are considered cash equivalents.
Accounts receivable. Accounts receivable often have an "allowance for bad debt
exPEnse" or "allowance for doubtful accounts" as a contra account.
Inventory.
Financial assets such as marketable SECurities.
Prepaid exPEnses. Items that will be exPEnses on future income statements.
ProPErty, plant, and equipment. Includes a contra-asset account for
accumulated depreciation.
Investment in affiliates accounted for using the equity method.
Deferred tax assets.
Intangible assets. Economic resources of the firm that do not have a physical
form, such as patents, trademarks, licenses, and goodwill. Except for goodwill,
these values may be reduced by "accumulated amortization."
Liabilities are creditor claims on the company's resources. Examples of liabilities
include:
Accounts payable and trade payables.
Financial liabilities such as short-term notes payable.
Unearned revenue. Items that will show up on future income statements as
revenues.
Income taxes payable. The taxes accrued during the past year but not yet paid.
Long-term debt such as bonds payable.
Deferred tax liabilities.
Owners' equity is the owners' residual claim on a firm's resources, which is the
amount by which assets exceed liabilities. Owners' equity includes:
Capital. Par value of common stock.
Additional paid-in capital. Proceeds from common stock sales in excess of par
value. (Share repurchases that the company has made are represented in the
contra account treasury stock.)
Retained earnings. Cumulative net income that has not been distributed as
dividends.
Other comprehensive income. Changes resulting from foreign currency
translation, minimum PEnsion liability adjustments, or unrealized gains and
losses on investments.
Revenue represents inflows of economic resources and includes:
Sales. Revenue from the firm's day-to-day activities.
Gains. Increases in assets from transactions incidental to the firm's day-to-day
activities.
Investment income such as interest and dividend income.
ExPEnses are outflows of economic resources and include:
Cost of goods sold.
Selling, general, and administrative exPEnses. These include such exPEnses as
advertising, management salaries, rent, and utilities.
Depreciation and amortization. To reflect the "using up" of tangible and
intangible assets.
Tax exPEnse.
Interest exPEnse.
Losses. Decreases in assets from transactions incidental to the firm's day-to-day
activities.
LOS 22.c: Explain the accounting equation in its basic and expanded forms.
CFA(r) Program Curriculum, Volume 3, page 48
The basic accounting equation is the relationship among the three balance sheet
elements:
assets = liabilities + owners' equity
Owners' equity consists of capital contributed by the firm's owners and the cumulative
earnings the firm has retained. With that in mind, we can state the expanded
accounting equation:
assets = liabilities + contributed capital + ending retained earnings
Ending retained earnings for an accounting PEriod are the result of adding that
PEriod's retained earnings (revenues minus exPEnses minus dividends) to beginning
retained earnings. So the expanded accounting equation can also be stated as:
assets =
liabilities
+ contributed capital
+ beginning retained earnings
+ revenue
- exPEnses
- dividends
LOS 22.d: Describe the process of recording business transactions using an
accounting system based on the accounting equation.
CFA(r) Program Curriculum, Volume 3, page 53
Keeping the accounting equation in balance requires double-entry accounting, in
which a transaction has to be recorded in at least two accounts. An increase in an asset
account, for example, must be balanced by a decrease in another asset account or by
an increase in a liability or owners' equity account.
Some typical examples of double entry accounting include:
Purchase equipment for $10,000 cash. ProPErty, plant, and equipment (an
asset) increases by $10,000. Cash (an asset) decreases by $10,000.
Borrow $10,000 to purchase equipment. PP&E increases by $10,000. Notes
payable (a liability) increases by $10,000.
Buy office supplies for $100 cash. Cash decreases by $100. Supply exPEnse
increases by $100. An exPEnse reduces retained earnings, so owners' equity
decreases by $100.
Buy inventory for $8,000 cash and sell it for $10,000 cash. The purchase
decreases cash by $8,000 and increases inventory (an asset) by $8,000. The sale
increases cash by $10,000 and decreases inventory by $8,000, so assets increase
by $2,000. At the same time, sales (a revenue account) increase by $10,000 and
"cost of goods sold" (an exPEnse) increases by the $8,000 cost of inventory. The
$2,000 difference is an increase in net income and, therefore, in retained
earnings and owners' equity (ignoring taxes).
LOS 22.e: Describe the need for accruals and valuation adjustments in preparing
financial statements.
CFA(r) Program Curriculum, Volume 3, page 71
Revenues and exPEnses are not always recorded at the same time that cash receipts
and payments are made. The principle of accrual accounting requires that revenue is
recorded when the firm earns it and exPEnses are recorded as the firm incurs them,
regardless of whether cash has actually been paid. Accruals fall into four categories:
1. Unearned revenue. The firm receives cash before it provides a good or service
to customers. Cash increases and unearned revenue, a liability, increases by the
same amount. When the firm provides the good or service, revenue increases
and the liability decreases. For example, a newspaPEr or magazine subscription
is typically paid in advance. The publisher records the cash received and
increases the unearned revenue liability account. The firm recognizes revenues
and decreases the liability as it fulfills the subscription obligation.
2. Accrued revenue. The firm provides goods or services before it receives cash
payment. Revenue increases and accounts receivable (an asset) increases.
When the customer pays cash, accounts receivable decreases. A typical
example would be a manufacturer that sells goods to retail stores "on
account." The manufacturer records revenue when it delivers the goods but
does not receive cash until after the retailers sell the goods to consumers.
3. Prepaid exPEnses. The firm pays cash ahead of time for an anticipated exPEnse.
Cash (an asset) decreases and prepaid exPEnse (also an asset) increases.
Prepaid exPEnse decreases and exPEnses increase when the exPEnse is actually
incurred. For example, a retail store that rents space in a shoPPIng mall will
often pay its rent in advance.
4. Accrued exPEnses. The firm owes cash for exPEnses it has incurred. ExPEnses
increase and a liability for accrued exPEnses increases as well. The liability
decreases when the firm pays cash to satisFY it. Wages payable are a common
example of an accrued exPEnse, as companies typically pay their employees at
a later date for work they PErformed in the prior week or month.
Accruals require an accounting entry when the earliest event occurs (paying or
receiving cash, providing a good or service, or incurring an exPEnse) and require one or
more offsetting entries as the exchange is completed. With unearned revenue and
prepaid exPEnses, cash changes hands fIRSt and the revenue or exPEnse is recorded
later. With accrued revenue and accrued exPEnses, the revenue or exPEnse is recorded
fIRSt and cash is exchanged later. In all these cases, the effect of accrual accounting is
to recognize revenues or exPEnses in the appropriate PEriod.
Other Adjustments
Most assets are recorded on the financial statements at their historical costs. However,
accounting standards require balance sheet values of certain assets to reflect their
current market values. Accounting entries that update these assets' values are called
valuation adjustments. To keep the accounting equation in balance, changes in asset
values also change owners' equity, through gains or losses recorded on the income
statement or in "other comprehensive income."
LOS 22.f: Describe the relationships among the income statement, balance sheet,
statement of cash flows, and statement of owners' equity.
CFA(r) Program Curriculum, Volume 3, page 68
Figures 1 through 4 contain the financial statements for a sample corporation. The
balance sheet summarizes the company's financial position at the end of the current
accounting PEriod (and in this example, it also shows the company's position at the
end of the previous fiscal PEriod). The income statement, cash flow statement, and
statement of owners' equity show changes that occurred during the most recent
accounting PEriod.
Note these key relationships among the financial statements:
The income statement shows that net income was $37,500 in 20X8. The
company declared $8,500 of that income as dividends to its shareholders. The
remaining $29,000 is an increase in retained earnings. Retained earnings on the
balance sheet increased by $29,000, from $30,000 in 20X7 to $59,000 in 20X8.
The cash flow statement shows a $24,000 net increase in cash. On the balance
sheet, cash increased by $24,000, from $9,000 in 20X7 to $33,000 in 20X8.
One of the uses of cash shown on the cash flow statement is a repurchase of
stock for $10,000. The balance sheet shows this $10,000 repurchase as a
decrease in common stock, from $50,000 in 20X7 to $40,000 in 20X8.
The statement of owners' equity reflects the changes in retained earnings and
contributed capital (common stock). Owners' equity increased by $19,000, from
$80,000 in 20X7 to $99,000 in 20X8. This equals the $29,000 increase in
retained earnings less the $10,000 decrease in common stock.

LOS 22.g: Describe the flow of information in an accounting system.
CFA(r) Program Curriculum, Volume 3, page 73
Information flows through an accounting system in four stEPS:
1. Journal entries record every transaction, showing which accounts are changed
and by what amounts. A listing of all the journal entries in order of their dates is
called the general journal.
2. The general ledger sorts the entries in the general journal by account.
3. At the end of the accounting PEriod, an initial trial balance is prepared that
shows the balances in each account. If any adjusting entries are needed, they
will be recorded and reflected in an adjusted trial balance.
4. The account balances from the adjusted trial balance are presented in the
financial statements.
LOS 22.h: Describe the use of the results of the accounting process in SECurity
analysis.
CFA(r) Program Curriculum, Volume 3, page 75
An analyst does not have access to the detailed information that flows through a
company's accounting system but sees only the end product (the financial statements).
An analyst needs to understand the various accruals, adjustments, and management
assumptions that go into the financial statements. Much of this detail is contained in
the footnotes to the statements and Management's Discussion and Analysis, so it is
crucial for an analyst to review these parts of the financial statements. With this
information, the analyst can better judge how well the financial statements reflect the
company's true PErformance and what adjustments to the data are necessary for
appropriate analysis.
Because adjustments and assumptions within the financial statements are, at least to
some extent, at the discretion of management, the possibility exists that management
may attempt to manipulate or misrepresent the company's financial PErformance. A
good understanding of the accounting process can help an analyst identiFY financial
statement entries that apPEar to be out of line.
KEY CONCEPTS
LOS 22.a
Business activities are classified as oPErating activities if they are part of a firm's
ordinary business, investing activities if they involve buying or disposing of long-term
assets, or financing activities if they are to issue or repay debt, issue or repurchase
stock, or pay cash dividends.
LOS 22.b
Transactions are recorded in accounts that form the financial statement elements:
Assets--the firm's economic resources.
Liabilities--creditors' claims on the firm's resources.
Owners' equity--paid-in capital (common and preferred stock), retained
earnings, and cumulative other comprehensive income.
Revenues--sales, investment income, and gains.
ExPEnses--cost of goods sold, selling and administrative exPEnses,
depreciation, interest, taxes, and losses.
LOS 22.c
The basic accounting equation:
assets = liabilities + owners' equity
The expanded accounting equation:
assets = liabilities + contributed capital + ending retained earnings
The expanded accounting equation can also be stated as:
assets = liabilities + contributed capital + beginning retained earnings + revenue
- exPEnses - dividends
LOS 22.d
Keeping the accounting equation (A - L = E) in balance requires double entry
accounting, in which a transaction is recorded in at least two accounts. An increase in
an asset account, for example, must be balanced by a decrease in another asset
account or by an increase in a liability or owners' equity account.
LOS 22.e
A firm must recognize revenues when they are earned and exPEnses when they are
incurred. Accruals are required when the timing of cash payments made and received
does not match the timing of the revenue or exPEnse recognition on the financial
statements.
LOS 22.f
The balance sheet shows a company's financial position at a point in time.
Changes in balance sheet accounts during an accounting PEriod are reflected in the
income statement, the cash flow statement, and the statement of owners' equity.
LOS 22.g
Information enters an accounting system as journal entries, which are sorted by
account into a general ledger. Trial balances are formed at the end of an accounting
PEriod. Accounts are then adjusted and presented in financial statements.
LOS 22.h
Since financial reporting requires choices of method, judgment, and estimates, an
analyst must understand the accounting process used to produce the financial
statements in order to understand the business and the results for the PEriod. Analysts
should be alert to the use of accruals, changes in valuations, and other notable
changes that may indicate management judgment is incorrect or, worse, that the
financial statements have been deliberately manipulated.

ANSWERS - CONCEPT CHECKERS
1. The groups into which business activities are classified for financial reporting
are:
A. current and non-current.
B. oPErating, investing, and financing.
C. assets, liabilities, equity, revenues, and exPEnses.
Business activities are classified for financial reporting purposes as oPErating,
investing, or financing activities.
2. Accounts receivable and accounts payable are most likely classified as which
financial statement elements?
Accounts receivable
Accounts payable
A. Assets
B. Revenues
C. Revenues
Liabilities
Liabilities
ExPEnses
Accounts receivable are an asset and accounts payable are a liability.
3. Annual depreciation and accumulated depreciation are most likely classified as
which financial statement elements?
Depreciation
A. ExPEnses
B. ExPEnses
C. Liabilities
Accumulated depreciation
Contra liabilities
Contra assets
Contra assets
Annual depreciation is an exPEnse. Accumulated depreciation is a contra asset
account that typically offsets the historical cost of proPErty, plant, and
equipment.
4. The accounting equation is least accurately stated as:
A. owners' equity = liabilities - assets.
B. ending retained earnings = assets - contributed capital - liabilities.
C. assets = liabilities + contributed capital + beginning retained earnings +
revenue - exPEnses - dividends.
Owners' equity is equal to assets minus liabilities.
5. A decrease in assets would least likely be consistent with a(n):
A. increase in exPEnses.
B. decrease in revenues.
C. increase in contributed capital.
The expanded accounting equation shows that assets = liabilities + contributed
capital + beginning retained earnings + revenue - exPEnses - dividends. A
decrease in assets is consistent with an increase in exPEnses or a decrease in
revenues but not with an increase in contributed capital.
6. An electrician repaired the light fixtures in a retail shop on October 24 and sent
the bill to the shop on November 3. If both the electrician and the shop
prepare financial statements under the accrual method on October 31, how
will they each record this transaction?
Electrician
A. Accrued revenue
B. Accrued revenue
C. Unearned revenue
Retail shop
Accrued exPEnse
Prepaid exPEnse
Accrued exPEnse
The service is PErformed before cash is paid. This transaction represents
accrued revenue to the electrician and an accrued exPEnse to the retail shop.
Since the invoice has not been sent as of the statement date, it is not shown in
accounts receivable or accounts payable.
7. If a firm raises $10 million by issuing new common stock, which of its financial
statements will reflect the transaction?
A. Income statement and statement of owners' equity.
B. Balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement.
C. Balance sheet, cash flow statement, and statement of owners' equity.
The $10 million raised apPEars on the cash flow statement as a cash inflow
from financing and on the statement of owners' equity as an increase in
contributed capital. Both assets (cash) and equity (common stock) increase on
the balance sheet. The income statement is unaffected by stock issuance.
8. An auditor needs to review all of a company's transactions that took place
between August 15 and August 17 of the current year. To find this information,
she would most likely consult the company's:
A. general ledger.
B. general journal.
C. financial statements.
The general journal lists all of the company's transactions by date. The general
ledger lists them by account.
9. Paul Schmidt, a representative for Westby Investments, is explaining how
SECurity analysts use the results of the accounting process. He states, "Analysts
do not have access to all the entries that went into creating a company's
financial statements. If the analyst carefully reviews the auditor's report for
any instances where the financial statements deviate from the appropriate
accounting principles, he can then be confident that management is not
manipulating earnings." Schmidt is:
A. correct.
B. incorrect, because the entries that went into creating a company's
financial statements are publicly available.
C. incorrect, because management can manipulate earnings even within
the confines of generally accepted accounting principles.
Schmidt is correct in stating that analysts do not have access to the detailed
accounting entries that went into a company's financial statements. However,
he is incorrect in stating that an analyst can be sure management is not
manipulating earnings if the audit report does not list deviations from
accounting principles. Because accruals and many valuations require
management's judgment, there is considerable room within the accounting
standards for management to manipulate earnings.

FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS
Study Session 6
EXAM FOCUS
This topic review covers accounting standards: why they exist, who issues them, and
who enforces them. Know the difference between the roles of private standard-setting
bodies and government regulatory authorities and be able to name the most
important organizations of both kinds. Become familiar with the framework for
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), including qualitative characteristics,
constraints and assumptions, and features for preparing financial statements. Be able
to identiFY barriers to convergence of national accounting standards (such as U.S.
GAAP) with IFRS, key differences between the IFRS and U.S. GAAP frameworks, and
elements of and barriers to creating a coherent financial reporting network.
LOS 23.a: Describe the objective of financial statements and the importance of
financial reporting standards in SECurity analysis and valuation.
CFA(r) Program Curriculum, Volume 3, page 102
According to the IASB Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting 2010, the
objective of financial reporting is to provide information about the firm to current and
potential investors and creditors that is useful for making their decisions about
investing in or lending to the firm.
The conceptual framework is used in the development of accounting standards. Given
the variety and complexity of possible transactions and the estimates and assumptions
a firm must make when presenting its PErformance, financial statements could
potentially take any form if reporting standards did not exist. Thus, financial reporting
standards are needed to provide consistency by narrowing the range of acceptable
responses.
Reporting standards ensure that transactions are reported by firms similarly. However,
standards must remain flexible and allow discretion to management to proPErly
describe the economics of the firm.
Financial reporting is not designed solely for valuation purposes; however, it does
provide important inputs for valuation purposes.
LOS 23.b: Describe roles and desirable attributes of financial reporting standardsetting bodies and regulatory authorities in establishing and enforcing reporting
standards, and describe the role of the International Organization of SECurities
Commissions.
CFA(r) Program Curriculum, Volume 3, page 105
Standard-setting bodies are professional organizations of accountants and auditors
that establish financial reporting standards. Regulatory authorities are government
agencies that have the legal authority to enforce compliance with financial reporting
standards.
The two primary standard-setting bodies are the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(FASB) and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). In the United States,
the FASB sets forth Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Outside the
United States, the IASB establishes International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).
Other national standard-setting bodies exist as well. Many of them (including the
FASB) are working toward convergence with IFRS. Some of the older IASB standards
are referred to as International Accounting Standards (IAS).
Desirable attributes of standard-setters:
Observe high professional standards.
Have adequate authority, resources, and comPEtencies to accomplish its
mission.
Have clear and consistent standard-setting processes.
Guided by a well-articulated framework.
OPErate indePEndently while still seeking input from stakeholders.
Should not be compromised by sPEcial interests.
Decisions are made in the public interest.
Regulatory authorities, such as the SECurities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the
United States and the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom, are
established by national governments. Figure 1 summarizes the SEC's filing
requirements for publicly traded companies in the United States. These filings, which
are available from the SEC Web site (www.SEC.gov), are arguably the most important
source of information for the analysis of publicly traded firms.
Most national authorities belong to the International Organization of SECurities
Commissions (IOSCO). The three objectives of financial market regulation according to
IOSCO1 are to (1) protect investors; (2) ensure the fairness, efficiency, and
transparency of markets; and (3) reduce systemic risk. Because of the increasing
globalization of SECurities markets, IOSCO has a goal of uniform financial regulations
across countries.
Figure 1: SECurities and Exchange Commission Required Filings
Form S-1. Registration statement filed prior to the sale of new SECurities to the
public. The registration statement includes audited financial statements, risk
assessment, underwriter identification, and the estimated amount and use of
the offering proceeds.
Form 10-K. Required annual filing that includes information about the business
and its management, audited financial statements and disclosures, and
disclosures about legal matters involving the firm. Information required in Form
10-K is similar to that which a firm typically provides in its annual report to
shareholders. However, a firm's annual report is not a substitute for the
required 10-K filing. Equivalent SEC forms for foreign issuers in the U.S. markets
are Form 40-F for Canadian companies and Form 20-F for other foreign issuers.
Form 10-Q. U.S. firms are required to file this form quarterly, with updated
financial statements (unlike Form 10-K, these statements do not have to be
audited) and disclosures about certain events such as significant legal
proceedings or changes in accounting policy. Non-U.S. companies are typically
required to file the equivalent Form 6-K semiannually.
Form DEF-14A. When a company prepares a proxy statement for its
shareholders prior to the annual meeting or other shareholder vote, it also files
the statement with the SEC as Form DEF-14A.
Form 8-K. Companies must file this form to disclose material events including
significant asset acquisitions and disposals, changes in management or
corporate governance, or matters related to its accountants, its financial
statements, or the markets in which its SECurities trade.
Form 144. A company can issue SECurities to certain qualified buyers without
registering the SECurities with the SEC but must notiFY the SEC that it intends to
do so.
Forms 3, 4, and 5 involve the beneficial ownership of SECurities by a company's
officers and directors. Analysts can use these filings to learn about purchases
and sales of company SECurities by corporate insiders.
LOS 23.c: Describe the status of global convergence of accounting standards and
ongoing barriers to developing one universally accepted set of financial reporting
standards.
CFA(r) Program Curriculum, Volume 3, page 113
The EuroPEan Union requires IFRS financial reporting by publicly listed companies. In
most major countries that have not fully adopted IFRS, accounting standard setters are
attempting to converge their standards with IFRS. Many asPEcts of U.S. GAAP and IFRS,
for example, have converged over the past decade, and the SECurities and Exchange
Commission no longer requires IFRS reporting firms to reconcile their financial
statements to U.S. GAAP. IFRS convergence efforts are also ongoing in Japan, China,
and many other countries.
One barrier to convergence (developing one universally accepted set of accounting
standards) is simply that different standard-setting bodies and the regulatory
authorities of different countries can and do disagree on the best treatment of a
particular item or issue. Other barriers result from the political pressures that
regulatory bodies face from business groups and others who will be affected by
changes in reporting standards.
LOS 23.d: Describe the International Accounting Standards Board's conceptual
framework, including the objective and qualitative characteristics of financial
statements, required reporting elements, and constraints and assumptions in
preparing financial statements.
CFA(r) Program Curriculum, Volume 3, page 117
The ideas on which the IASB bases its standards are expressed in the "Conceptual
Framework for Financial Reporting" that the organization adopted in 2010. The IASB
framework details the qualitative characteristics of financial statements and sPEcifies
the required reporting elements. The framework also notes certain constraints and
assumptions that are involved in financial statement preparation.
At the center of the IASB Conceptual Framework is the objective to provide financial
information that is useful in making decisions about providing resources to an entity.
The resource providers include investors, lenders, and other creditors. Users of
financial statements need information about the firm's PErformance, financial
position, and cash flow.
Qualitative Characteristics
There are two fundamental characteristics that make financial information useful:
relevance and faithful representation.2
Relevance. Financial statements are relevant if the information in them can
influence users' economic decisions or affect users' evaluations of past events
or forecasts of future events. To be relevant, information should have predictive
value, confirmatory value (confirm prior exPEctations), or both. Materiality is an
asPEct of relevance.3
Faithful representation. Information that is faithfully representative is complete,
neutral (ABSence of bias), and free from error.
There are four characteristics that enhance relevance and faithful representation:
comparability, verifiability, timeliness, and understandability.
Comparability. Financial statement presentation should be consistent among
firms and across time PEriods.
Verifiability. IndePEndent observers, using the same methods, obtain similar
results.
Timeliness. Information is available to decision makers before the information is
stale.
Understandability. Users with a basic knowledge of business and accounting and
who make a reasonable effort to study the financial statements should be able
to readily understand the information the statements present. Useful
information should not be omitted just because it is complicated.
Required Reporting Elements
The elements of financial statements are the by-now familiar groupings of assets,
liabilities, and owners' equity (for measuring financial position) and income and
exPEnses (for measuring PErformance). The Conceptual Framework describes each of
these elements:4
Assets. Resources controlled as a result of past transactions that are exPEcted to
provide future economic benefits.
Liabilities. Obligations as a result of past events that are exPEcted to require an
outflow of economic resources.
Equity. The owners' residual interest in the assets after deducting the liabilities.
Income. An increase in economic benefits, either increasing assets or decreasing
liabilities in a way that increases owners' equity (but not including contributions
by owners). Income includes revenues and gains.
ExPEnses. Decreases in economic benefits, either decreasing assets or
increasing liabilities in a way that decreases owners' equity (but not including
distributions to owners). Losses are included in exPEnses.
An item should be recognized in its financial statement element if a future economic
benefit from the item (flowing to or from the firm) is probable and the item's value or
cost can be measured reliably.
The amounts at which items are reported in the financial statement elements dePEnd
on their measurement base. Measurement bases include historical cost (the amount
originally paid for the asset), amortized cost (historical cost adjusted for depreciation,
amortization, depletion, and impairment), current cost (the amount the firm would
have to pay today for the same asset), net realizable value (the estimated selling price
of the asset in the normal course of business minus the selling costs), present value
(the discounted value of the asset's exPEcted future cash flows), and fair value (the
price at which an asset could be sold, or a liability transferred, in an orderly transaction
between willing parties).
Professor's Note: In the next Study Sessions, we will discuss these measurement bases in more detail
and the situations in which each is appropriate.
Constraints and Assumptions
According to the Conceptual Framework, there is cost-benefit tradeoff of
the enhancing characteristics.5 Accordingly, the benefit that users gain
from the information should be greater than the cost of presenting it. Another
constraint, not sPEcifically mentioned in the Conceptual Framework, is the fact that
non-quantifiable information about a company (its reputation, brand loyalty, capacity
for innovation, etc.) cannot be captured directly in financial statements.
Two important underlying assumptions of financial statements are accrual accounting
and going concern.6 Accrual accounting means that financial statements should reflect
transactions at the time they actually occur, not necessarily when cash is paid. Going
concern assumes the company will continue to exist for the foreseeable future. If this
is not the case, then presenting the company's financial position fairly requires a
number of adjustments (e.g., its inventory or other assets may only be worth their
liquidation values).
LOS 23.e: Describe general requirements for financial statements under International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).
CFA(r) Program Curriculum, Volume 3, page 123
International Accounting Standard (IAS) No. 1 defines which financial statements are
required and how they must be presented. The required financial statements are:
Balance sheet (statement of financial position).
Statement of comprehensive income.
Cash flow statement.
Statement of changes in owners' equity.
Explanatory notes, including a summary of accounting policies.
The general features for preparing financial statements are stated in IAS No. 1:
Fair presentation, defined as faithfully representing the effects of the entity's
transactions and events according to the standards for recognizing assets,
liabilities, revenues, and exPEnses.
Going concern basis, meaning the financial statements are based on the
assumption that the firm will continue to exist unless its management intends
to (or must) liquidate it.
Accrual basis of accounting is used to prepare the financial statements other
than the statement of cash flows.
Consistency between PEriods in how items are presented and classified, with
prior-PEriod amounts disclosed for comparison.
Materiality, meaning the financial statements should be free of misstatements
or omissions that could influence the decisions of users of financial statements.
Aggregation of similar items and separation of dissimilar items.
No offsetting of assets against liabilities or income against exPEnses unless a
sPEcific standard PErmits or requires it.
Reporting frequency must be at least annually.
Comparative information for prior PEriods should be included unless a sPEcific
standard states otherwise.
Also stated in IAS No. 1 are the structure and content of financial statements:
Most entities should present a classified balance sheet showing current and
noncurrent assets and liabilities.
Minimum information is required on the face of each financial statement and in
the notes. For example, the face of the balance sheet must show sPEcific items
such as cash and cash equivalents, plant, proPErty and equipment, and
inventories. Items listed on the face of the comprehensive income statement
must include revenue, profit or loss, tax exPEnse, and finance costs, among
others.
Comparative information for prior PEriods should be included unless a sPEcific
standard states otherwise.
LOS 23.f: Compare key concepts of financial reporting standards under IFRS and US
generally accepted accounting principles (US GAAP) reporting systems.
CFA(r) Program Curriculum, Volume 3, page 127
U.S. GAAP consists of standards issued by the FASB, along with numerous other
pronouncements and interpretations. Like the IASB, the FASB has a framework for
preparing and presenting financial statements. The two organizations have made
significant progress toward a common framework, but the two frameworks still differ
in several resPEcts.
The IASB framework lists income and exPEnses as elements related to
PErformance, while the FASB framework includes revenues, exPEnses, gains,
losses, and comprehensive income.
The FASB defines an asset as a future economic benefit, whereas the IASB
defines it as a resource from which a future economic benefit is exPEcted to
flow. Also, the FASB uses the word probable in its definition of assets and
liabilities.
The FASB does not allow the upward valuation of most assets.
Analysts will need to interpret financial statements that are prepared under different
standards. In many cases, however, a company will present a reconciliation statement
showing what its financial results would have been under an alternative reporting
system. For example, firms that list their shares in the United States but do not use
U.S. GAAP or IFRS are required to reconcile their financial statements with U.S. GAAP.
For IFRS firms listing their shares in the United States, reconciliation is no longer
required.
Even if a unified framework emerges, sPEcial reporting standards that apply to
particular industries (e.g., insurance and banking) will continue to exist.
LOS 23.g: IdentiFY characteristics of a coherent financial reporting framework and the
barriers to creating such a framework.
CFA(r) Program Curriculum, Volume 3, page 129
A coherent financial reporting framework is one that fits together logically. Such a
framework should be transparent, comprehensive, and consistent.
Transparency--Full disclosure and fair presentation reveal the underlying
economics of the company to the financial statement user.
Comprehensiveness--All tyPEs of transactions that have financial implications
should be part of the framework, including new tyPEs of transactions that
emerge.
Consistency--Similar transactions should be accounted for in similar ways
across companies, geographic areas, and time PEriods.
Barriers to creating a coherent financial reporting framework include issues related to
valuation, standard setting, and measurement.
Valuation--Measurement bases for valuation that require little judgment, such
as historical cost, may be less relevant than a basis like fair value that requires
more judgment.
Standard setting--Three appROAches to standard setting are a "principlesbased" appROAch that relies on a bROAd framework, a "rules-based" appROAch
that gives sPEcific guidance about how to classiFY transactions, and an
"objectives-oriented" appROAch that blends the other two appROAches. IFRS is
largely a principles-based appROAch. U.S. GAAP has traditionally been more
rules-based, but the common conceptual framework is moving toward an
objectives-oriented appROAch.
Measurement--Another trade-off in financial reporting is between proPErly
valuing the elements at one point in time (as on the balance sheet) and proPErly
valuing the changes between points in time (as on the income statement). An
"asset/liability" appROAch, which standard setters have largely used, focuses on
balance sheet valuation. A "revenue/exPEnse" appROAch would tend to place
more significance on the income statement.
LOS 23.h: Describe implications for financial analysis of differing financial reporting
systems and the importance of monitoring developments in financial reporting
standards.
CFA(r) Program Curriculum, Volume 3, page 131
As financial reporting standards continue to evolve, analysts need to monitor how
these developments will affect the financial statements they use. An analyst should be
aware of new products and innovations in the financial markets that generate new
tyPEs of transactions. These might not fall neatly into the existing financial reporting
standards. The analyst can use the financial reporting framework as a guide for
evaluating what effect new products or transactions might have on financial
statements.
To keep up to date on the evolving standards, an analyst can monitor professional
journals and other sources, such as the IASB (www.ifrs.org) and FASB (www.fasb.org)
Web sites. CFA Institute produces position paPErs on financial reporting issues through
the CFA Institute Centre for Financial Market Integrity.
Finally, analysts must monitor company disclosures for significant accounting
standards and estimates.
LOS 23.i: Analyze company disclosures of significant accounting policies.
CFA(r) Program Curriculum, Volume 3, page 135
Companies that prepare financial statements under IFRS or U.S. GAAP must disclose
their accounting policies and estimates in the footnotes. Significant policies and
estimates that require management judgement are also addressed in Management's
Discussion and Analysis (management commentary). An analyst should use these
disclosures to evaluate what policies are discussed, whether they cover all the relevant
data in the financial statements, which policies required management to make
estimates, and whether the disclosures and estimates have changed since the prior
PEriod.
Another disclosure that is required for public companies is the likely impact of
implementing recently issued accounting standards. Management can discuss the
impact of adopting a new standard, conclude that the standard does not apply or will
not affect the financial statements materially, or state that they are still evaluating the
effects of the new standards. Analysts should be aware of the uncertainty this last
statement implies.

KEY CONCEPTS
LOS 23.a
The objective of financial statements is to provide economic decision makers with
useful information about a firm's financial PErformance and changes in financial
position.
Reporting standards are designed to ensure that different firms' statements are
comparable to one another and to narrow the range of reasonable estimates on which
financial statements are based. This aids users of the financial statements who rely on
them for information about the company's activities, profitability, and
creditworthiness.
LOS 23.b
Standard-setting bodies are private SECtor organizations that establish financial
reporting standards. The two primary standard-setting bodies are the International
Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and, in the United States, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB).
Regulatory authorities are government agencies that enforce compliance with financial
reporting standards. Regulatory authorities include the SECurities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) in the United States and the Financial Services Authority (FSA) in the
United Kingdom. Many national regulatory authorities belong to the International
Organization of SECurities Commissions (IOSCO).
LOS 23.c
Efforts to achieve convergence of local accounting standards with IFRS are underway in
most major countries that have not adopted IFRS.
Barriers to developing one universally accepted set of financial reporting standards
include differences of opinion among standard-setting bodies and regulatory
authorities from different countries and political pressure within countries from groups
affected by changes in reporting standards.
LOS 23.d
The IFRS "Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting" defines the fundamental and
enhancing qualitative characteristics of financial statements, sPEcifies the required
reporting elements, and notes the constraints and assumptions involved in preparing
financial statements.
The fundamental characteristics of financial statements are relevance and
faithful representation. The enhancing characteristics include comparability,
verifiability, timeliness, and understandability.
Elements of financial statements are assets, liabilities, and owners' equity (for
measuring financial position) and income and exPEnses (for measuring
PErformance).
Constraints on financial statement preparation include cost versus benefit and
the difficulty of capturing non-quantifiable information in financial statements.
The two primary assumptions that underlie the preparation of financial
statements are the accrual basis and the going concern assumption.
LOS 23.e
Required financial statements are the balance sheet, comprehensive income
statement, cash flow statement, statement of changes in owners' equity, and
explanatory notes.
The general features of financial statements according to IAS No. 1 are:
Fair presentation.
Going concern.
Accrual accounting.
Consistency.
Materiality.
Aggregation.
No offsetting.
Reporting frequency.
Comparative information.
Other presentation requirements include a classified balance sheet and sPEcific
minimum information that must be reported in the notes and on the face of the
financial statements.
LOS 23.f
The IASB and FASB frameworks are similar but are moving towards convergence. Some
of the remaining differences are:
The IASB lists income and exPEnses as PErformance elements, while the FASB
lists revenues, exPEnses, gains, losses, and comprehensive income.
There are minor differences in the definition of assets. Also, the FASB uses the
word probable when defining assets and liabilities.
The FASB does not allow the upward revaluation of most assets.
Firms that list their shares in the United States but do not use U.S. GAAP or IFRS are
required to reconcile their financial statements with U.S. GAAP. For IFRS firms listing
their shares in the United States, reconciliation is no longer required.
LOS 23.g
A coherent financial reporting framework should exhibit transparency,
comprehensiveness, and consistency.
Barriers to creating a coherent framework include issues of valuation, standard setting,
and measurement.
LOS 23.h
An analyst should be aware of evolving financial reporting standards and new products
and innovations that generate new tyPEs of transactions.
LOS 23.i
Under IFRS and U.S. GAAP, companies must disclose their accounting policies and
estimates in the footnotes and MD&A. Public companies are also required to disclose
the likely impact of recently issued accounting standards on their financial statements.
