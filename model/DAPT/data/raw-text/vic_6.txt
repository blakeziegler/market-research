Description
Let’s be clear, whether you grew up eating grinders, hoagies, subs, heros, wraps, sammys, toastys, or good old sandwiches – one that is well-made is simple and delicious.  They could be breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  In fact, most of my single NYC days were no forks, knives, or dirty dishes because a sandwich was too good to pass up.  Americans are known for their love of sandwiches – I would not be surprised if many of you are enjoying one right now while reading this writeup.  I frequent several of the national chains (Jersey Mike’s, Which Wich, Firehouse, Jimmy John’s, and even Subway), but today am discussing an opportune time to invest in the only publicly traded pure-play with a very long growth runway: Potbelly (PBPB).
There have been a few well-done Potbelly VIC writeups over the years. For excellent background information that I will not fully rehash, I’d point you to the 2022 write-up by mm202.  He posted when Potbelly was closer to a $100m market cap, making it challenging for many of you to get involved.  Today, the market cap (and EV) stands closer to $330m with ADV of ~$2m/day, so continue if that works for you.
Thesis: Potbelly is a fast-casual restaurant chain with 444 locations (103 franchise) mainly known for their oven-toasted sandwiches. They have been a public company for about 12 years with plenty of ups and downs.  CEO Bob Wright (former Wendy’s COO) made a slew of improvements to Potbelly since taking the helm in July 2020.  Those positive operational changes have resulted in 37% higher average-unit-volumes (AUVs), 160bp higher restaurant-level-margins (RLMs), 260bp improvement in EBITDA margins, and equity returns of +250% since pre-Covid-19.  We believe the shares can double+ from here with Potbelly at an inflection point - moving from a value/turnaround story to a growth stock, powered by a combination of: 1) Accelerating franchise unit growth, 2) Improving same-store-sales (SSS), 3) Rising margins, and 4) The potential for a significant EBITDA multiple re-rating versus their current 8x 2026.
Leadership:  It has been all about Bob (CEO, ex-Wendy’s) and Steve (CFO, ex-Panera).  The entire Potbelly management team is top-notch.  We have met with nearly all the public restaurant companies over the years, and Potbelly’s C-suite ranks in the upper-tier - quite impressive for a small/micro player.  Potbelly is a strong brand with a 50-year history, but there was not much going right when Bob joined in 2020.  He quickly launched a “Five-Pillar Strategic Plan” which has worked and continues to work.  Key additional accomplishments thus far include:
1. Increased menu innovation: Prime rib, Cubano, Pulled Pork sandwiches, Banana Pudding shake, drinks from Tractor Beverage (like Chipotle).
2. Tech advancements: investment in digital ordering, delivery partnerships, and a revamped loyalty program leading to higher AOVs. Digital sales are now 42% of sales [+1200bps], positioning the brand well with younger consumers.
3. Diversified off-premise offerings: 1st party, 3rd party, digital pickup, and catering.
4. Optimized balance of pricing/limited-time-offers (LTOs): effectively driving traffic without sacrificing RLMs. A balanced approach to value through every-day and promotional value (ie. $7.99 combo deals, limited BOGOs).
5. Revitalized franchising strategy: a high touch development model for real estate selection, design/construction, and opening support.
Key Catalysts: 
1. Accelerating franchise growth: With unit economics (AUVs and RLMs) at multi-year highs, franchise demand will continue to accelerate, which is most of the future unit growth.  After several years of flat/negative growth, total system unit growth should increase to >10% in 2026 and beyond.   On their current base of 444 company-owned locations and 103 franchised units, they now have 350+ additional commitments (+40 in 1Q25) from franchise partners.  This gives solid visibility for approximately 6 years of 10%-unit growth.   Management is currently targeting a 2000-unit chain (~16 years of store growth @ a 10% growth rate).  It’s important to note that RLMs should continue to move higher from their 15% level, as same-store-sales improve, and new shops open in lower rent markets.   New shops are opening with rent expenses in the 7-8% range versus the current company average of 10.8% (due to some high-cost areas such as Chicago/Washington DC).  We are highly confident that franchise unit openings will meet or exceed their 6-unit target for Q2, and 38 for 2025.
2. Same-store-sales (SSS) are improving: Post-COVID SSS fully normalized in 4Q23.   Over the past three quarters, SSS have accelerated [Q4 0.3%, Q1 0.9%, Q2 2% guidance]. Based on credit card data and discussions with management, we believe SSS are running around +3% QTD vs +1.7% consensus, which would be their best result in 6 quarters.   Also note that comparisons in 2H25 are easy.
3. Valuation: The multiple is too low with shares currently trading at the lower end of the restaurant group, around 8x 2026 EBITDA.  We think there is considerable room for multiple expansion as they shift from a value/turnaround multiple (8x) to a growth multiple (LDD-Teens) when management achieves their +LDD new unit growth target for the years 2026 and beyond.  Each turn of EBITDA is ~$1.30/sh of equity value.  An EBITDA multiple range of 11-16x on 2026 EBITDA implies a near-term equity value of $15.00-21.50/sh (40-100% upside).   EBITDA growth should compound at a mid-teens level in 2027 and beyond.
4. EPS Power: 2000 units @ current economics + inflationary growth = >$3b of system sales.   This implies 1550 additional franchise units generating an incremental $140m+ of Franchise Royalites and Fees, assuming a $1.5m AUV @ 6% royalty rate.  As the asset-light model flywheel takes hold, we would expect FCF to be used for share buyback and dividend.
5. Competing fast-casual concepts acquired: While we do not expect PBPB to be acquired in the near-term as management ramps up franchise growth, we do expect the company to be acquired in the coming years.  Within the past 7 months, both Jersey Mike’s (3,000 locations by Blackstone for $8b in November 2024) and Dave’s Hot Chicken (300 units with 1000 additional signed up, by Roark for $1b in June 2025) were acquired.   Others acquired over the past few years include Firehouse Subs (1,200 units at time of acquisition by RBI for $1b in December 2021 – EBITDA was ~$50m, so 20x), and Subway (37,000 units at time of acquisition by Roark for $9.6b in August 2023).
