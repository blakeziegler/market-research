• Economic and currency volatility
• Tech disruption risks

Liquidity
Current, quick, and cash ratios peaked in 2020, then declined. Cash flow from operations remains strong, but cash reserves fell due to tripled CAPEX and stock buybacks in 2022.

Solvency
Debt/Equity dropped from 5.76x in 2017 to 0.84x in 2022. Interest Coverage Ratio improved dramatically, peaking at 81.61 in 2022, showing strong financial health.

Profitability
Revenue growth remains strong. 5Y CAGR: 55.92%. Gross margin ~30%, rising slightly. EBITDA margin rose from 7.68% in 2018 to 21.51% in 2022 (36% average annual growth). ROE, ROIC, and ROA have all turned strongly positive. Only Ferrari has comparable profitability (ROA 15.73%, ROE 35.84%, ROIC 24.34%).

DuPont Analysis
Asset Turnover: Rose to 0.99x in 2022
Operating Margin: Rising since 2020
Financial Leverage: Fell from 4.71x (2018) to 1.79x (2022)
These metrics support the rise in Tesla’s Return on Equity and profitability strength.
Cash Conversion Cycle
The Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) for Tesla is determined by Day Sales Outstanding (DSO), Days of Inventory Outstanding (DIO), and Day Payables Outstanding (DPO). The CCC formula helps measure how efficiently a company manages its working capital: the shorter the CCC, the more effective the company is at turning inventory into cash and delaying outflows to suppliers. A short CCC improves liquidity by accelerating cash availability. In 2022, Tesla maintained stable DSO (~13 days) and DPO (~67 days). However, DIO, which had been declining, rose sharply by +44.6% YoY in 2022. As a result, CCC increased from 2 days in 2021 to 27 days in 2022, reflecting weakened liquidity. The increase in competition, inflation, and supply chain disruptions were the main contributors. Despite price cuts on popular models like the Tesla Model 3 in Q4, inventory turnover failed to improve. Tesla’s working capital rose over the last 5 years, primarily due to inventory and accounts receivable increasing more than accounts payable.

Valuation
We applied two valuation approaches:
	•	Intrinsic valuation via Discounted Cash Flow (FCFF-based)
	•	Relative valuation via comparable company analysis

Figure 7. 5-Step Dupont (2018–2022)
Tax Burden: 0.97 → 0.87
Interest Burden: 3.99 → 1.97
Operating Profit Margin: -0.01 → 0.17
Asset Turnover: 0.72 → 0.99
Leverage Ratio: 4.71 → 1.79

Cost of Capital
We used a constant cost of capital across the model, computed from the following components:

Risk-Free Rate
Assumed as the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond yield = 3.40%

Equity Risk Premium (ERP)
Calculated via a bottom-up approach using a geographic revenue breakdown (U.S., China, RoW). By weighting country-specific ERPs (Damodaran) by their revenue share, ERP = 6.70%.
ERP = Σ(Rev_i / Total Rev) * ERP_i

Beta
Computed using a bottom-up approach, splitting Tesla’s business into Auto (95%) and Renewable Energy (5%). Segment unlevered betas (Damodaran) were adjusted using Bloomberg methodology and weighted by EV/sales per segment.
Unlevered Beta = 0.9716
Levered Beta (using Hamada formula, marginal tax rate 23.01%) = 0.9804

Cost of Equity
Cost of equity (k_e) = r_f + β * ERP = 3.40% + 0.9804 * 6.70% = 9.97%

Cost of Debt
Pre-tax cost of debt = r_f + spread
Due to Tesla’s strong interest coverage, a synthetic A/A2 rating was assigned with a 1.42% spread.
Pre-tax cost of debt = 3.40% + 1.42% = 4.82%
Cost of debt (after-tax) = 4.82% * (1 - 0.2301) = 4.10%

Market Value of Debt
Interest-bearing debt ≈ $5,748M
Interest expense in prior year: $191M
Using a 3-year maturity and present value calculations, market value of debt = $5,624.75M

Terminal Value
Calculated using Gordon Growth Model with long-term growth = r_f = 3.40%

DCF Valuation and Sensitivity
Estimated enterprise value = PV(FCFF over 10 years) + PV(Terminal Value)
Equity Value = EV + Cash - Debt - Options
Divided by outstanding shares, the resulting price per share = $60.04
This implies a ~60% downside from $164.31 (28 April).

Assumptions:
Terminal Year Revenue = $386B (≈50% more than Toyota’s 2022 revenue)
Terminal EBIT Margin = >13% (vs industry average ~6%, reflecting software-like margin expectations due to FSD monetization)

Sensitivity analysis tested values per share under TGR range (2%–4.5%) and WACC range (9%–11.5%). Results show nearly symmetric price sensitivity to both assumptions with 50 bps variation.
approximately resulting in a 5-7% variation in share price.
Multiples Analysis
Tesla operates in both the electric vehicle and broader automotive industries. For the EV industry, comparable firms are primarily based in China. However, due to the negative multiples of most Chinese EV companies, which deviate significantly from Tesla’s valuation metrics, these were deemed unsuitable for comparison. Ultimately, we selected five core comparables from the automotive industry, primarily in the US and Japan, including BMW in Europe, and two EV-specific comparables. To cross-check the results from our DCF model, we conducted a market multiple analysis. The average EV/EBITDA and P/E ratios of the selected seven companies were -6.14x and 7.59x, respectively. These values may be distorted due to some firms having negative EBITDA or EPS. For the final valuation, we applied the average EV/Sales multiple of the peer group to Tesla’s projected sales in year five of our forecast.

Final Valuation Methodology
To determine the final price target, we calculated a weighted average of the values derived from both the DCF and relative valuation methods, assigning greater weight to the DCF because it incorporates both revenue growth and profitability. This led to a target price of $57.20 per share, implying a 65.19% downside from the closing price on April 28, 2023.

Investment Risks

Competition and Margin Compression
Tesla’s recent pricing strategy has focused on reducing vehicle prices to increase inventory turnover and compete in an intensifying competitive environment. From January to April 2023, Tesla executed six price cuts, reducing the Model 3 price by 11% and Model Y by 20%. Despite this, Tesla only reported Q1 deliveries of approximately 423,000 vehicles, a 4% increase from Q4 2022, signaling limited demand elasticity. To meet the 2023 target of 2 million deliveries, additional price cuts may be necessary, further compressing profit margins and potentially pressuring the stock’s future performance.

Restricted Model Range
Tesla currently offers four models: Model S, Model X, Model 3, and Model Y. The Model Y, launched in 2020, was the most recent addition. Anticipation for the Cybertruck, a pickup truck first announced in 2020, has faded due to multiple delays, and while limited production may begin in 2023, analysts expect full-scale production only in 2024. The Cybertruck is expected to primarily target North American markets. Tesla has also announced the Semi truck, though the start of production remains unclear. In contrast, competitors consistently introduce new models at a higher frequency, putting Tesla at risk of falling behind in product diversity and innovation.

Political and Governance Risk Factors
Tesla is exposed to political risk across various jurisdictions. For instance, revisions to the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in the U.S. removed eligibility for the $7,500 EV tax credit for the base Model 3 due to its battery pack being assembled in China, which violates IRA requirements. In 2022, prior versions of the IRA supported sales of all Model 3 variants, including the base model. Rising U.S.-China trade tensions also pose risks. Recently, China banned Tesla vehicles in certain regions due to data security concerns related to Tesla’s software.

On the governance front, Tesla has long been highly dependent on Elon Musk. A 2020 filing highlighted this reliance, stating the company is “highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk.” Since Musk’s acquisition of Twitter in 2022, Tesla’s stock price has shown increased correlation with his personal decisions and media presence. In 2023, a Tesla shareholder submitted a resolution calling for a key-person risk report to be put to a vote in May. Tesla has no publicly disclosed succession plan, raising concerns about leadership continuity in the event of Musk’s absence or exit.
