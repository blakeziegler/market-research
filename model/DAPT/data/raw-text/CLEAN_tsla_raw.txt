PErformance, technologically advanced electric cars and solar
energy generation and energy storage products. It is a fastly
growing company (55.92% Revenue CAGR over the last 5 years).
The US customers generate about half of Tesla's sales. Tesla sells
more than five fully electric models and has a growing global
network of Tesla SuPErchargers. Moreover, it offers certain
advanced driver assist systems under its Autopilot and Full SelfDriving options. From a valuation standpoint, we PErformed both
ABSolute and relative valuation. For the ABSolute one, we used
FCFF through 2032 plus TV, discounted at a WACC of 9.90%.
The final price PEr share of the company resulting from the
analysis is $60.04. A more PEssimistic result is obtained through
the relative analysis: using the EV/Sales multiple, we obtained a
final price PEr share of $48.67. Therefore, our recommendation is
a SELL with a final target price of $57.20.

Company Overview
Tesla is an American multinational automotive and clean energy
company, founded in 2003 and controlled since 2004 by Elon
Musk. As of 2022, it is the most valuable automaker in the world
and retains the largest market share in sales of Battery Electric
Vehicles. Through its energy division, although relatively small
compared to its auto segment, Tesla installs photovoltaic systems
and is one of the largest suppliers of battery storage systems in
the United States.
Revenues
Tesla generates revenues from three main sources:
* Automotive: making up the largest share of revenues for
the company, automotive revenues include proceeds from
sales of Tesla's five car models: Model S, Model X, Semi
(a work-in progress semi-truck), Model 3, and Model Y.
* Services: these revenues are related to after-sales vehicle
services and parts, SuPErcharging revenues (Tesla's
charging stations network), sales of used vehicles,
merchandise, and vehicle insurance revenue.
* Energy Generation and Storage: Tesla's revenues from
the clean energy SECtor come from sales and leasing of solar
panels and energy storage products, and services related to
such products. These include solar panels, the Tesla Solar
Roof, the Tesla Solar Inverter (solar energy systems), the
Powerpack, the Powerwall, and the Megapack (energy
storage systems).
Tesla's main market is represented by the United States, making
up approximately half of Tesla's revenues; the Chinese market
follows, representing ca. 23% of sales; the rest of the revenues
come from the rest of the world. In EuroPE, Tesla's market share
is not as prominent as the one it retains in its home market, but
as it stands, it is the fastest-growing automaker in the region.
ExPEnses
Costs are divided into:
* Cost of automotive sales revenue includes direct and
indirect materials, labor costs, manufacturing overhead,
including depreciation costs of tooling and machinery,
shiPPIng and logistic costs, vehicle connectivity costs,
allocations of electricity and infrastructure costs related to
free SuPErcharging programs and reserves for estimated
warranty exPEnses.
* Cost of automotive
leasing revenue
the
depreciation of oPErating lease vehicles, cost of goods sold

includes
Source: Minerva Investment Society
* Cost of services and other revenue includes costs
associated with providing non-warranty after-sales services
and parts, costs of paid SuPErcharging, cost of used
vehicles including refurbishment costs, costs for retail
merchandise, and costs to provide vehicle insurance.
Tesla's Cost of Goods Sold primarily comes from the automotive
SECtor. Tesla's gross margin has slightly increased from 2021 to
2022, not budging in front of a sizable increase in revenues.
SPEcifically, while the margins in the automotive and services
segment have slightly decreased, exPEnses in the energy segment
have not increased as much as revenues did (40% vs 24%),
allowing Tesla to keep its gross margins far above the industry
average.
Industry Outlook
The aim of this industry analysis is to understand the dynamics
faced by the companies oPErating within the field of automotive.
Automotive Industry
The EV market's history is a recent and fascinating one. Analysts
exPEct to see the number of global EV sales doubling by 2030.
Such a young industry fits well the description of high growth
but high risk, encompassing several opportunities and probably
even more challenges. A brief overview of its recent history will
help clariFY these dynamics. When odds were in favor of electric
solutions, the pandemic and the subsequent crisis caused growth
to slow down, not to mention the devastating effects supply
chain disruption had for these companies. ComPEtition brings
advantages for customers who now face relatively cheaPEr prices
and enjoy a wider range of choice, while governments keep
incentivizing both companies and privates to switch to these
sustainable solutions. Environmental awareness has been a key
driver in promoting the industry, with countries from the AsiaPacific taking the lead in sales (50.7%), followed by EuroPE
(approximately 25%) and the US (close to 10%). The PErcentage
of EV over total vehicles sold keEPS rising every year in every
geographic area, with significant acceleration estimates mainly
involving the major EuroPEan and American areas. New entrants
struggled to keep up with investments and established firms in
the automotive industry were forced to rapidly act to catch up
with this worldwide movement. Catalysts worthy of mentioning
are mainly related to the developments in the current
macROEconomic situation and upcoming regulations from
governments aimed at sPEeding up the transition. Other big stEPS
taken towards the transition include technological advancements
such as fast/smart chargers and improvements in connectivity.
Political and regulatory actions include the loosening of caps on
units sold eligible for government incentives and new consumerside encouragements which justiFY the recent increase in
demand.
Porter's 5 Forces
Buyer Power: moderate. Tesla's customers are mainly wealthy
individuals who value innovation, technology, luxury, and
environmental responsibility. They have high exPEctations and
standards for Tesla's products and services. However, they can
easily switch to other brands if they are not satisfied with Tesla's
offerings. Brand image, quality, and innovation are crucial to
enhance customer loyalty, but Tesla is very well positioned from
this PErsPEctive. Furthermore, bargaining power is related to
geographical drivers such as availability of other luxury electric
vehicles brands and government incentives.
Supplier Power: moderate. The company relies on various
suppliers for its raw materials, components, and parts. Tesla's
suppliers include battery manufacturers, metal producers,
software develoPErs, and solar panel makers. These suppliers
have moderate bargaining power because of the importance of
industry. Nonetheless, Tesla has
cost-leadership
the
in
diversified its supplier base, developing long-term relationships
with strategic partners. Another possible strategy could be
integrating vertically with some suppliers (exactly what
Panasonic did for batteries). Another driver to highlight is
learning curves: while in the short run this force is strongly
adverse, due to agreement with suppliers, reduced waste in
materials and automatization processes, the company can
overcome these initial difficulties.
Substitutes: low. Although it is true that Tesla's products can be
substituted by conventional vehicles (gasoline or diesel), hybrid
vehicles (gasoline-electric) and public transportation, it is also
true that EV's are the real substitutes in these markets and not
vice-versa. Environmental sustainability makes their product not
only different but also more attractive. It is reasonable to assume
that their choice of this sPEcific market mainly dePEnds on the
weakness of this force, which is actually turned to an advantage:
regulations and environmental efforts are slowly devastating all
substitutes, allowing a fIRSt mover like Tesla to leverage on these
changes to grow their market share. Timing is also crucial, as
exactly when comPEtitors must fight substitutes such as electric
vehicles by implementing new technology and converting their
products to more eco-friendly solutions, Tesla already has a foot
in this market and can cut exPEnses to gain comPEtitive
advantage.
requirements, economies of scale,
Threat of New Entrants: low. Barriers to entry include high
capital
technological
complexity, brand reputation, customer loyalty, and regulatory
compliance. These barriers make it difficult for new entrants to
enter and comPEte with Tesla in these markets. The main threat
comes from big players in the automotive industry, who have the
means and the resources to expand in these emerging markets,
but the latter can't be deemed as new players as they represent
existing comPEtitors. Therefore, new entrants mainly include
smaller eastern companies (esPEcially Chinese) that have
aggressively targeted these markets in the past years. The main
difference lies in the markets themselves, as the two rarely
oPErate in the same areas and, due to obvious factors, they aren't
therefore comparable. As a matter of fact, the number of eastern
companies that have already begun to sell their products in the
US or in EuroPE is extremely low and often associated with
disappointing results caused by brand weakness.
Rivalry among Existing ComPEtitors: high. Tesla comPEtes
with many established traditional automakers as well as other
EV producers in the global market, such as NIO, Toyota, Li
Auto, Volkswagen, Ford, GM, BMW, and Nissan. These
comPEtitors have more resources, exPErience, brand recognition,
and customer loyalty. They also offer a wider range of products
and services, including hybrid and conventional vehicles. Tesla's
comPEtitive advantage lies in its innovation, quality, design and
environmental sustainability. Key drivers to outPErform the
market are cost-leadership and differentiation. Nonetheless, we
should consider that Tesla oPErates in a PEculiar market: it does
not target traditional automotive customers, neither those
looking for luxury cars or the simple EV customer but rather a
combination of the above: its price and design make it part of the
elite segment, esPEcially if adding autonomous drive as a niche
feature. On top of that, it is among the only western companies
only dealing with fully electric vehicles, making its product
unique.
SWOT Analysis
Strengths:
* Tesla is a leader in the electric vehicle (EV) market, with a
strong brand image, loyal customer base, and innovative
products that offer high PErformance, safety, and design.
* Tesla's portfolio and products are very diverse.
* Tesla has a strong research and development (R&D)
capability that enables it to constantly innovate and
improve its products and technologies, such as bringing
battery production in-house, introducing new models
(Cybertruck, Semi), and developing autonomous driving
features.
Weaknesses
* Some challenges are faced in production and delivery
processes, such as mechanical complications, supply chain
disruptions, and high costs that affect its profitability.
* Tesla has a reputation for being involved in legal disputes,
regulatory issues, and ethical controversies that damage its
public image and trustworthiness. For example, Tesla faces
lawsuits over sexual misconduct, employee safety
concerns, product liability claims, and product defects.
* Tesla relies heavily on the charismatic leadership of Elon
Musk, who is also the CEO of SpaceX and Neuralink. This
poses a risk of losing focus, direction, and vision for Tesla
if Musk is targeted by the media (think of the recent
acquisition of Twitter).
Opportunities
* Tesla has an opportunity to expand its sales and presence
in untapPEd or emerging markets, such as China, India,
EuroPE, and Africa.
* Tesla can leverage its market confidence and customer
loyalty to increase its revenue streams and profitability by
offering more value-added services, such as subscription
insurance products, and
plans,
maintenance packages.
software updates,
* Tesla can collaborate with other players in the EV charging
stations industry to create a more standardized and
interoPErable network that can benefit all EV users and
providers.
Threats
* Tesla faces intense comPEtition from other established
automakers that are entering or expanding in the EV
market.
* Tesla also faces comPEtition from other emerging players
in the EV charging stations industry that offer alternative
or cheaPEr solutions to SuPErchargers: ChargePoint is
Tesla's main rival in the US.
* Changes in consumer preferences or behaviors can reduce
the demand for EVs or Tesla products. These could also be
caused by changes in government policies or regulations
that affect the EV market or Tesla oPErations.
* Changes in economic conditions or exchange rates affect
the cost of production or sales of EVs or Tesla products.
* Changes in technological innovations or disruptions can
render Tesla products obsolete or inferior.
Figure 3. Liquidity Ratios
Financial Analysis
Liquidity
In order to analyze Tesla's liquidity, we used three ratios: current,
quick, and cash ratio. There has been a PEak in 2020, and,
afterwards, the liquidity metrics of the company started to
decrease. Although its cash flow from oPErating activities has
been consistently positive and increasing over the 5-year PEriod,
the cash balance of the company has been decreasing since 2020
due to CAPEX (that almost tripled since 2020 up to 2022), and
an important stock buyback in 2022 (while in 2020 a massive
issue of stocks occurred).
Solvency
In order to assess Tesla's ability to sustain its activity in the long
term, we decided to look at its Interest Coverage Ratio and D/E
ratio. We notice the company has decreased its financial leverage
over time, esPEcially from 2020 on, passing from 5.76x in 2017
to 0.84x in 2022 (Debt/Book Equity). At the same time, the
Interest Coverage Ratio, which has been negative for many
years, meaning that the debt position of Tesla would not have
been sustainable, reached a PEak of 81.61 in 2022, a huge result
that allows to say that the current financial position of Tesla is
by far under control.
Profitability
Regarding the analysis of the profitability margins, revenue
growth rate has always been positive, reaching the PEak in 2021;
in particular, CAGR has declined in the last 5 years but overall
it is still impressive, with a figure of 55.92%.
Gross margin stands at constant values of around 30%, with a
slightly increasing trend, while EBITDA margin has a strong
uptrend, ranging from 7.68% in 2018 to 21.51% in 2022, with a
5-year annual increase on average of 36%. This is not surprising
given that Tesla is a growth car manufacturing company, and a
huge growth in revenues, in comparison to a less than
proportional growth of COGS, led to this increasing margins.
Moreover, there has been a substantial increase in the quality of
ROE, ROIC and ROA in the last 5 years, passing from a negative
situation to positive margins; a quick comparison between Tesla
and its main comPEtitors shows the quality of the profitability
ratios of the company; only Ferrari come closer to this
achievement, resPEctively with 15.73% of ROA, 35.84% of
ROE and 24.34% of ROIC.
It may be useful to investigate which are the main variables that
impact on shareholder profitability through the 5-step Dupont
model. Asset turnover settled in the PEriod 2018-2022 at values
that were mostly constant until 2020 but with an increase up to
0.99x in 2022. The OPErating Profit Margin has increased in all
historical years considered, in particular from 2020 to 2022, and
this justifies the positivity of the Return on Equity. Moreover,
the positivity of this indicator was amplified above all in the 5year PEriod 2018-2022 by the financial leverage, but with a
declining trend, passing from 4.71x in 2018 to 1.79x in 2022.

Cash Conversion Cycle
The Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) for Tesla is determined by
Day Sales Outstanding (DSO), Days of Inventory Outstanding
(DIO), and Day Payables Outstanding (DPO). The CCC formula
is used to understand how efficiently a company is managing its
working capital: the shorter the cash conversion cycle is, the
better the company is at selling inventories and recovering cash
from these sales while paying suppliers. Furthermore, a short
CCC has a positive impact on the investment flows of the
company thanks to the faster and greater availability of cash.
Tesla had a stable DPO and DSO, resPEctively around 67 and 13
in 2022. The DIO, instead, had a decreasing trend until 2021,
underlining the ability to sell its inventory, but in 2022 DIO
increased +44.6% YoY. Consequently, the CCC after a strong
decreasing trend faced a dramatic increase in 2022, passing from
2 to 27. This fact weakened the liquidity availability of the
company for FY2022. The rising
intense
comPEtition and the problems in supply chain were the main
sources of this slow down, and neither the tactic move of cutting
down the retail price of the best-selling vehicles like Tesla Model
3 in the fourth quarter helPEd to increase the turnover of
inventory. Moreover, the company showed a rise in working
capital over the past 5 years. This is mainly due to the increase
in inventories and accounts receivable that were more than
proportional with resPEct to the increase in accounts payable (in
particular 2022 inventory).

Cost of Capital
Figure 8. Cash Conversion Cycle
Source: Minerva Investment Society
Throughout the whole analysis, we used a constant cost of
capital. We can therefore start looking at how we computed it
through its different components.
Risk-free rate
The risk-free rate has been assumed to be equal to the 10-year
Treasury bond yield (3.40%).
ERP
To compute the ERP, we followed a bottom-up appROAch.
Differently from the computations carried out to get the
measurement of beta, we used, instead of a business-segment
division, a geographic division of revenues, as we concluded that
this would be a better proxy of risk premium. We divided Tesla's
revenues in three main geographic sources: the United States,
China, and the rest of the world. By computing the weighted
average of the single ERPs (Damodaran) with the proportional
share of revenues, the ERP resulted to be equal to 6.70%.
"
ERP = %
!#$
Rev!
Total	Rev
ERP!
Beta
To compute the beta of Tesla, we used the bottom-up appROAch
as well. In particular, we fIRSt divided Tesla's business into two
main segments: Auto (95% of revenues) and Green and
Renewable Energy (5% of revenues). Then, we took the
unlevered beta for each segment (Damodaran), applied the
Bloom adjustment, and computed a weighted average by the
estimated value of business. The estimated value of business was
in turn computed by multiplying sales PEr segment by the
EV/sales factor for each segment (Damodaran). The unlevered
beta, as a result, is equal to 0.9716.

To compute the levered beta, we used the Hamada formula and
a marginal tax rate of 23.01%, and the levered beta is therefore
equal to 0.9804.
Cost of Equity
The cost of equity, therefore, is equal to:
Cost	of	equity = k4 = r5 + 6 ERP = 9.97%
Cost of Debt
To compute the cost of debt, we added the risk-free rate to the
spread of Tesla's debt:
Pre - tax	cost	of	debt = rf	rate + debt	spread
To compute Tesla's debt spread, we assumed that due to a very
high level of interest coverage (which would put its synthetic
rating at AAA/Aaa), the spread should be lower than the one
commanded by its current debt rating (BBB-/Baa3); therefore,
we assumed the correct spread was 1.42%, which corresponds to
a debt rating of A/A2. Therefore, with the pre-tax cost of debt
equaling 4.82%, using a marginal tax rate of 23.01%, we
estimated that the cost of debt would be equal to 4.10%.
Cost	of	debt = k7 = Pre - tax	cost	of	debt (1 - t)
Market Value of Debt
To estimate the market value of debt, we fIRSt added up all of the
interest-bearing debt Tesla was holding, which is approximately
equal to $5,748 million. Then, we took last year's interest
exPEnse, $191 million, and computed the present value of the
interest exPEnse and of Tesla's current debt, using an average
maturity of 3 years. As a result, the market value of debt is equal
to $5,624.75 million.

The Terminal Value was computed by applying Gordon's growth
model, assuming a long-term growth rate equal to the risk-free
rate (3.40%):

DCF Valuation and Sensitivity Analysis
We calculated the estimated value PEr share by summing the
present value of FCFF over the 10 years and the present value of
the terminal value:
Enterprise	value = PV(Terminal	value) + PV(FCFF)
We then added cash, subtracted the market value of debt and the
value of options, and divided the resulting Equity Value by the
number of shares outstanding.
The target price we derived is therefore equal to $60.04, with a
downside of ca. 60% compared to the last closing price of
$164.31 (28/04). This target price was derived forecasting
revenues of 386 billion dollars in the terminal year (we should
note that this implies that Tesla will generate almost 50% more
revenues than what Toyota, the biggest carmaker in the world,
did in 2022). At the same time, we exPEct margins to reach more
than 13% in the terminal year, much higher than the automotive
industry average (6%) and more similar to the software industry
one, taking into account the possible expansion of the revenues
deriving from the full self-driving technology.
According to our sensitivity analysis, which we carried out by
estimating the value PEr share by varying the terminal growth
rate (range 2-4.5%) and the WACC (range 9-11.5%), the target
price is almost symmetrically influenced by variations in TGR
and WACC, with 50 bps variations
in both variables
approximately resulting in a 5-7% variation in share price.
Multiples Analysis
Tesla oPErates both in the electric vehicles and automotive
industries. For the electric vehicles industry, the comparable
companies selected are mainly located in China. However, after
evaluating the multiples, we observed the incompatibility of
most of them, given their negative values, and thus far from the
Tesla target. Finally, we decided to consider 5 core comps
oPErating in the automotive industry and mainly located in US
and Japan, including BMW in EuroPE, and 2 comps oPErating in
the electric vehicles industry. In order to check the results
obtained through the DCF model, we have PErformed a market
multiple analysis. The average EV/EBITDA and P/E multiples
of the 7 companies were -6,14x and 7,59x resPEctively.
However, these values could be compromised by the fact that
some comps have negative EPS and EBITDA. Given the
multiples, for the valuation of the final price we used average
EV/Sales of the industry multiplied by the estimated sales of
Tesla in the fifth year of our forecast.
Final Valuation Methodology
For deriving the price target, we computed a weighted average
of the values obtained from the two analyses, attributing a higher
weight to the DCF result because it captures both top-line
revenue growth and profitability. This leads to a target price of
$57.20/share, implying a 65.19% decrease from the last close
price (28/04/2023).
Investment Risks
ComPEtition and Margins Compression
The latest news from Tesla's price list show continuous cutting
prices, in order to increase the turnover of the inventory and to
comPEte with a stronger comPEtition environment. From
January to April 2023 there have been a total of 6 cuts, with a
decline in prices of Tesla Model 3 by a cumulative 11% and
Model Y by a cumulative 20% since the start of the year. But this
hasn't led to the hoPEd growth on sales: This week Tesla reported
Q1 deliveries of almost 423,000 vehicles, up just 4% from the
Q4 2022 after price cuts in the United States, China and other
markets aiming to spur demand. Moreover, to reach out the
target of 2 Million deliveries for 2023, a further reduction in
prices apPEars inevitable, leading to an important compression
in profit margins for the next quarters and compromising future
stock prices PErformance.
Restricted Model Range
The range of Tesla models, at the MoMent, is limited to 4: Model
S, Model X, Model 3 and Model Y. The Model Y was the latest
model of Tesla since 2020, and from then no models came out.
There was huge "hyPE" back in 2020 for the "Cybertruck", a
pick-up vehicle, but its availability has continuously pushed
back and might start in 2023. Analysts exPEct a start of full-scale
production only in 2024, also considering that it would be mostly
a vehicle for North America. Tesla also announced future release
of the Semi, but the production year is still unclear. In
comparison, Tesla's comPEtitors continuously announce new
models with a higher frequency, so the risk is that Tesla's model
range will soon became obsolete.
Political and Governance Risk Factors
Tesla is affected by worldwide political factors, that differs from
country to country, that can either boost or prevent its sales. For
example, latest changes in Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), that
provided a tax credit of 7.500$ under certain conditions, made
Tesla Model 3 base model not eligible because the battery pack
is produced and assembled in China (and not in USA as the IRA
requires), while the previous drafts of the IRA boosted the sales
of all Tesla models 3 versions, including the base version, in
2022. Other problems may come from the trade tensions between
USA and China, as recently the Chinese Government banned the
use of Teslas in certain parts of the country, and Chinese officials
are concerned about the data gathering from Tesla's software.
Regarding governance, a 2020 quarterly filing included a note
about Tesla's reliance on Elon Musk. Tesla is "highly dePEndent
on the services of Elon Musk, Technoking of Tesla and our Chief
Executive Officer," the company said. 2 years later, after the
acquisition of Twitter, the correlation between Tesla's stock price
PErformance and its CEO actions has been proven, and recently
a shareholder of Tesla has submitted a resolution for Tesla
investors to vote in May on whether the board should prepare
and maintain a key-PErson risk report. Tesla lack a clear public
succession plan or strategy to ameliorate the impacts of a
charismatic leader's possible loss, without anyone challenging
them.
