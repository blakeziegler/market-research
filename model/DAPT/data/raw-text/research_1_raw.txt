DCF (Discounted Cash Flow) valuation has a long tradition that dates back to early works of Miller, Modigliani, Gordon, and Shapiro. Major contributions in the field have been made by Copeland, Damodaran, and Fernandez.

In simple terms, DCF valuation—originally applied to valuing projects—is based on evaluating the value of milk produced by a cow (i.e., future cash flow streams) rather than the meat value of the cow itself (i.e., asset value). The market value depends on expected future payment surpluses, which are discounted back to the present.

The DCF method, also known as the “intrinsic value method,” is introduced first because it is the primary valuation method used in most company assessments.

Another common approach is the “peer comparison” method (or multiples approach), where a company is valued by analogy with similar companies or assets. This assumes market efficiency—if markets are efficient, then the valuation of one company can be derived from the valuation of its peers. Ideally, the market value and the present value of cash flows should converge.

Another method is the sum-of-the-parts approach (or restated net asset value), where a company is valued as the sum of its assets minus its net debt. Variations include using book values as a base.

Attempts have also been made to apply options theory to valuation. Though theoretically compelling and potentially revolutionary in valuing equity, structural approaches are currently used more often for credit risk estimation. Real options are still in use, though their popularity has declined since the early 2000s.

Mixed methods—often a weighted average of DCF and restated net asset value—should be used cautiously. These can be manipulated easily, so it’s better to analyze differences across methods rather than averaging results.

This overview reveals three basic valuation approaches: cash flow-based, market-based, and asset-based. These methods will be discussed further in Chapter 1.1.

The set of valuation methods commonly used in a country is shaped by its history and economic environment. Typically, the methods include:
	1.	Replacement method
	2.	Restated net asset value method
	3.	Liquidation value method
	4.	Multiple method
	5.	DCF method

Once this list is formalized, it often serves as a benchmark for company valuations. The method selected for any particular valuation depends on several factors:
	1.	If financial markets are stable, market values are usable, making the multiple method preferred. A multiple-derived value that exceeds a DCF-derived value may indicate the company should consider going public.
	2.	If a company generates positive cash flows, the DCF method is appropriate. In such cases, the DCF-derived value often exceeds those from other methods.
	3.	Companies that break even but have marketable assets are often evaluated using the restated net asset value method. If this value exceeds DCF value, it may suggest a strategy of divesting assets to enhance profitability.
	4.	Companies operating at a loss typically rely on the liquidation value method.
	5.	In many scenarios, especially when mandated by governing provisions, at least two methods are applied to establish a valuation range for negotiation purposes. When markets are stable and cash flows are positive, DCF and comparative methods are typically used.

Differences in value outcomes between methods can often be attributed to the lifecycle theory of company valuation. For example, a company in its post-maturity phase may see its DCF value fall below its restated net asset value as profits decline.

The DCF method dominates in the valuation of economically sound companies. Other methods are more straightforward and don’t require complex theoretical models. DCF, however, does. The principles of perfect markets, time value of money, cost of capital, portfolio theory, and others form the theoretical foundation of DCF.

There are standards for applying DCF—some are well-known and codified, while others require detailed explanation. This book focuses on the DCF method because it is the most complex, the most theoretically developed, and best suited for valuing profitable, economically sound firms. It is particularly effective for firms with genuine expertise—the backbone of the economy.

The main goal is to explain how the DCF method works, especially in scenarios where capital structure influences the cost of equity, as it does in real markets.

The core concept of DCF can be introduced with the standard valuation formula: the value of a company equals the present value of its future cash flows, discounted at the cost of capital.

There are three key elements in this valuation: cash flows, the cost of capital, and the model that ties them together into a coherent system.

Value
The main goal of a company is to increase its value for shareholders. Value refers to the present value of future cash flows generated by the company, discounted by an appropriate discount rate. This discount rate reflects risk and is known as the cost of capital.

This approach does not rely on book values and largely ignores the company’s property, which under DCF is treated as a means to generate cash flows, not an asset in itself.

For publicly listed companies, valuation may appear straightforward—multiply the number of shares by their market price to obtain the market value of equity. For private companies, value may be inferred from transaction prices in tenders. However, this introduces the distinction between price and value. Sellers and buyers often view value differently. A seller may emphasize fixed assets, while a buyer may prioritize market access or production capabilities. Different buyers value the same assets differently based on how they expect to generate future cash flows. Therefore, value is a relative concept and not identical to market price. When using market-based approaches like peer comparison, it is important to distinguish between price and value.

The P/E ratio is one of the most common profit-based indicators used in the multiple method. Defined as the stock price divided by earnings per share (EPS), the ratio can be applied to private companies by using the P/E ratio of a comparable listed firm and multiplying by the unlisted company’s earnings.

However, P/E does not account for debt, so using it assumes the benchmark company is equity-financed. To adjust, one can perform a hypothetical transformation. Suppose P = 32.50 and P/E = 6.1, giving EPS = 32.50 / 6.1 = 5.3279. With 10,000 shares, earnings after tax (EAT) = 53,279. If the company has debt D = 150,000 and pays 8% interest, annual interest I = 12,000. Without debt and with a 30% tax rate, the hypothetical profit would be 53,279 + 12,000*(1 - 0.3) = 61,679.

Replacing debt with equity at the same share price adds 150,000 / 32.50 = 4615 shares, bringing total shares to 14,615. The new EPS = 61,679 / 14,615 = 4.22. New P/E = 32.50 / 4.22 = 7.7.

This shows how misleading the P/E ratio can be. With debt, EPS is higher and P/E is lower than in an equity-only scenario. The simplifying assumption here is that share price remains unchanged when debt is replaced by equity, which is not realistic. Later sections will introduce formulas to incorporate capital structure effects.

Using P/E-based valuation may yield inaccurate results due to:
	1.	The difference between price and value
	2.	The limitations of book profit

A better alternative might involve using a cash flow-based ratio, as cash flows are more indicative of value. Still, cash flows alone lack information about future growth potential. Profits may be split between dividends and reinvestment. The balance of dividends, reinvestment, and risk affects value and will be addressed in detail later.

Other multiples include P/NOPAT, P/EBIT, and P/EBITDA. Price-to-sales and price-to-EBIT suffer from similar drawbacks. Enhancing these ratios rarely improves their reliability. Using the mean or median of a peer group is a common practice, but these should be applied cautiously.

Market prices introduce other issues. Buying a significant share volume can move the price, and market prices fluctuate. Although important, market price often fails to reflect a company’s intrinsic value. In illiquid markets, valuation can be distorted. Understanding this is critical for investors, sellers, and companies preparing for new issues.

Startups or companies undergoing major strategic change often lack reliable market data, making valuation necessary.

Proper valuation also informs executive compensation. Systems based on book values are easy to manipulate. Management could boost ROA by halting investment in fixed assets. R&D, which can depress profits in the short term, may be avoided if bonuses are tied to accounting profits. This discourages long-term investment and innovation.

Competence in valuation brings insight into key components of the valuation formula:

1.1.1. Cash Flows
Cash flows are a better measure of value than book profits, which can be misleading or even fictitious due to creative accounting. Depreciation explains some difference, but cash flow’s strength lies in its direct reflection of value creation.

Value depends on the size, timing, and certainty of future cash flows. If cash flows were certain, they could be discounted using the risk-free rate. For example, a future cash flow of 105 one year from now discounted at a 5% risk-free rate is worth 100 today.

But company cash flows are risky. Valuing under uncertainty requires several methods:
	1.	Certainty Equivalent: Accepting a guaranteed amount instead of risky cash flows. If a 150 or 90 payout is equally probable (50%), expected value = 120. If an investor is indifferent between that and a guaranteed 105, then 105 is the certainty equivalent.
	2.	Risk-Adjusted Discount Rate: More practical, this adjusts the discount rate to reflect risk. Expected FCF is discounted by the cost of capital (including risk premium). This method dominates because estimating discount rates is easier than estimating certainty equivalents.
	3.	Risk-Neutral Probabilities: Uses the risk-free rate for discounting and substitutes risk-neutral probabilities in the numerator. Denoted by EM, this removes subjective risk and replaces it with market-implied probabilities.

1.1.2. Assets of a Company – Balance Sheet
Valuing a company based on book assets is common, but often flawed. Usually only fixed assets and net working capital are considered, as current assets and liabilities cancel out. Still, book value often fails to capture true value because it ignores:
	•	Intangible assets
	•	The external environment
	•	Quality of management
	•	Human capital

These unrecorded elements are critical to a company’s real ability to generate future cash flows. The comments about the difference between book value and market value of assets are still valid. For example, assets that are fully depreciated and have a book value of zero can still be effectively used in the production process. Hence, numerous attempts to use figures other than the book value of assets are made.
	1.	Restated Net Value.
When using the restated net value method, book values—which for many reasons are far from reality—must be restated and revalued to better represent true asset value. Certain balance sheet components are adjusted: receivables past due are written off or reduced based on expected payment likelihood, inventory is revalued by eliminating hard-to-sell items and adjusting to market value, and fixed assets are reassessed by certified evaluators. In general, each asset is valued—some at market value (assuming they can be sold), others at replacement cost (if still operational). The method is easy to apply and generally accepted. However, it only makes sense when assets can be used independently of company operations. If not, the result from restated net value becomes meaningless.
	2.	Liquidation Value.
In the liquidation value method, book values are replaced with market values assuming the business is to be liquidated and sold quickly, typically in pieces. The resulting number provides a lower-bound price estimate for a company near bankruptcy. Liquidation costs, such as legal or administrative expenses, must also be estimated and deducted from the gross value.
	3.	Replacement Value.
The replacement value method estimates the cost of building a company with the same operational capacity. Components with no liquidation value are ignored. This method effectively becomes a hybrid of other valuation techniques.

However, none of these adjustments fully address the core problem: the gap between asset value and business value. Market value can be misleading—for example, expensive, specialized machinery that is difficult to relocate may have low resale value. Conversely, replacement value may be inflated—old equipment may be inefficient and costly. Liquidation value is typically the lowest.

The concept of economic value is sometimes discussed but remains vague. A sensible approach is to calculate potential cash flows while factoring in real production costs and product quality.

Example 2.
Consider a business—a copying center. Suppose instead of buying a commercial copier, we buy a scanner, computer, and printer. This setup is more expensive and produces similar quality. Its real value in a competitive market is low due to longer delivery times and higher costs. Additional capabilities like font changes or red-eye correction during copying are not sufficient to justify the investment.

Other methods include calculating book value of assets plus a fixed percentage of revenue or turnover. These methods attempt to link value to the company’s cash-generating ability, but are highly arbitrary and subjective. Results vary greatly depending on the evaluator’s assumptions, even for similar companies.

1.1.3. Summary
The discussion above on company valuation methods suggests that individual assets may be less important than how they are utilized. The broader organizational environment contributes significantly to a company’s value. Critical intangible components include:
	•	Business idea
	•	Technology
	•	Licenses
	•	Staff and management
	•	Organizational structure
	•	Brand
	•	Market share

Without these factors, even the most advanced equipment and machinery have limited worth. These elements enable high-quality, low-cost production that meets market demand. Estimating their value without future projections is impossible.

The value of a company depends on future cash flows.

To calculate value, we must:
	•	Estimate future cash flows
	•	Determine an appropriate discount factor (cost of capital)

Historical data are of limited use. Imagine two companies with different histories but similar optimistic future projections. The argument that market position depends on historical value is weak if future cash flows already capture that. Risk is critical but is accounted for in the cost of capital.

Future expected cash flows are derived from a company’s strategic plans and pro forma financial documents. These calculations begin with sales projections, which are informed by macroeconomic analysis. Economic growth forecasts influence purchasing power and demand expectations. This includes global, regional, and industry-specific factors.

Next comes microeconomic analysis to estimate unit prices and sales volume. In practice, recent sales serve as a baseline, then modest percentage growth is assumed. Costs are projected based on operations but must be contextualized with external variables. For example, material costs can be influenced by currency fluctuations.

Such projections typically span 5 to 9 years. Forecasting beyond that is imprecise. At this stage, a simplifying assumption is used. Cash flows are estimated through the forecast horizon, discounted to a terminal point, and this becomes the residual value.
In practice, it is often assumed that future cash flows (e.g. after 5 years) become a perpetuity or growing perpetuity. It significantly simplifies calculations of the residual value. The planned future cash flows are only expected values. In practice, a certain amount of risk is involved and there will always be some discrepancies between planned and realized values. This fact is taken into account in choosing a discount rate (cost of capital) that reflects the level of uncertainty that is risk.

1.2. Valuation Methods
Once we have financial documents pro forma, we can calculate the cash flows. There are two basic valuation methods, corresponding to two kinds of cash flows.
	1.	FCF – Free Cash Flow (cash flow available for both shareholders and debt holders)
FCF is cash that is generated by a company’s operational activity without taking interest payments into account. We hypothetically assume a situation where a company is equity financed only. The formula below is used in this case:

FCF = EBIT(1–T) + Depreciation – CAPEX – Change in Working Capital

The correction involves adding back depreciation and subtracting investments made by a company in working capital and fixed assets. Using the formula means that the tax shield is not taken into account directly. However, the tax shield is not ignored but included in the calculations of cost of capital (WACC – weighted average cost of capital).

WACC = kE * E/(E+D) + kD * (1–T) * D/(E+D)

Free Cash Flows are discounted and the value of a company is obtained. Then, the market value of debt can be deducted and what is left is the value of equity.

E = V – D

This method is called Flow to Firm (FTF), or the indirect method, since the value of equity is found indirectly—first the value of the entire firm is found and then equity is derived.
	2.	CF – Cash Flow (cash flow available for shareholders only)
We calculate cash flows (CF) available for shareholders:

CF = EAT + Depreciation – CAPEX – Change in Working Capital – Loan Repayments + New Debt

Cash Flows (CF) are discounted by the cost of equity, which is the rate of return required by shareholders. The value of debt is found independently, and the sum of equity and debt gives the total firm value:

V = E + D

This method is called Flow to Equity (FTE) or the direct method.

There is a clearly defined relationship between CF and FCF and the two equalities:
FCF = CF + Interest(1–T) – Net Borrowing
CF = FCF – Interest(1–T) + Net Borrowing

It is worth emphasizing that Free Cash Flows are purely hypothetical and (except for a company that is fully equity financed) are not cash flows that are obtained in reality.

It is also worth mentioning that sometimes Capital Cash Flow (CCF) or Debt Cash Flow (DCF) are used. The latter equals interest plus principal repayments or new borrowing. Then:

CCF = CF + DCF

The appropriate discount rate for CCF is a weighted average cost of capital without the tax shield, denoted as kA.

There is also the Adjusted Present Value (APV) method. In this approach, FCF is discounted using the cost of capital kU (unleveraged), which excludes the tax shield, assuming the firm is entirely equity financed. Then, corrections are added or subtracted to account for the present value of the tax shield, agency costs, and other relevant factors.

Example 3.
Here is the data concerning Hip Hop Inc.

EBIT: 694
Interest: 70
EBT: 624
Tax (34%): 212
EAT: 412
Dividends: 103
Retained Earnings: 309

Here is how to calculate the company’s cash flows:

EBIT(1–T) = 694*(1–0.34) = 458.04
Add Depreciation = 458.04 + 65 = 523.04
Change in Working Capital:
Accounts Receivable: 688 – 455 = 233
Inventory: 555 – 553 = 2
Accounts Payable: 266 – 232 = 34
Change in Working Capital = 233 + 2 – 34 = 201

Change in Net Fixed Assets = 1709 – 1644 + Depreciation = 65
Gross Investment in Fixed Assets = 130

FCF = 523.04 – 130 – 201 = 192.04

This is the Free Cash Flow that can be used in a DCF valuation using WACC. The example shows how to move from financial statements to cash flows suitable for valuation analysis.
Let us check whether the formula that translates CF into FCF applies. There are certain technical problems that are likely to appear in the calculations described so far.
	1.	One has to know the cost of capital WACC (and both its components: cost of debt and cost of equity) in order to calculate the value of a company.
	2.	One has to know the capital structure, that is the value of debt and equity, in order to calculate the cost of capital.
	3.	One has to know the value of interest payments, which depends on the value of debt, in order to calculate cash flows.

The problems create a logical loop: step 1 needs step 2, but step 2 requires step 1. In the next subsection we will show how to tackle the problem in a few specific situations. The problem may seem technical, but in fact it reflects a fundamental shift in how value can be determined.

Another issue is that the term “cash flows” is not clearly defined. We cannot rely on IFRS, US GAAP, or local laws for precise definitions. The two definitions of cash flows provided above are not the only ones used. They justify two distinct valuation methods while remaining general enough to allow variation.

For example, cash is often treated as a non-operational asset and removed from cash flow calculations. However, a certain amount of cash is always needed for operations. There are models (such as Baumol or Stone) for optimizing how much cash should be held. Therefore, cash levels should be treated as operational decisions. Many variations of cash flow methods exist.

1.2.1. Perpetuity, Given Capital Structure

There are various problems in company valuation. We will simplify to provide usable results. Below are examples of applying both valuation methods. First, we assume an infinite investment horizon (the company operates perpetually).

Example 4.
Suppose annual sales are 200. Costs are always 70% of sales. The company is financed with 20% debt (D/V = 20%). Cost of debt is 16%, cost of equity is 26%, and corporate income tax is 30%.

Flow to Firm Method (based on FCF):
Assume no debt to calculate FCF.
Sales: 200
Operational Costs: 140
EBIT: 60
Interest: 0
EBT: 60
Tax: 18
FCF: 42

Next, calculate WACC:
WACC = 0.2 * 16% * (1 – 0.3) + 0.8 * 26% = 23.05%

Firm Value = 42 / 0.2305 = 182.29
Debt = 20% of 182.29 = 36.46
Equity = 145.83

Now, include debt in the income statement:
Sales: 200
Operational Costs: 140
EBIT: 60
Interest: 5.83
EBT: 54.17
Tax: 16.25
CF: 37.92

Discount CF at 26%, which confirms the equity value of 145.83.

Flow to Equity Method (based on CF):
We use the same figures as above. Although we now know both methods yield the same result, they must be verified independently to avoid tautology.

However, we encounter a logical loop:
	1.	CF requires knowledge of interest, which depends on debt.
	2.	Debt value is derived from capital structure, which needs equity value.
	3.	Equity value is calculated by discounting CF, which is not yet known.

This loop can be resolved numerically or by solving a set of simultaneous equations. By substituting CF and D into the equations, we solve for E:

D/E = 0.25 implies D = 0.25 * E, solving gives E = 145.83, D = 36.46, as before.

The assumption of fixed capital structure has a flaw: if E changes, capital structure changes. Risk or expected cash flow changes can affect E, thus shifting the capital structure. For publicly traded firms, changes in share price affect value even if the business remains constant.

Maintaining a fixed debt ratio requires adjusting debt levels, which is not always practical. Still, assuming a known level of debt simplifies calculations.

Cost of equity depends on financial risk, which is influenced by capital structure. Therefore, defining structure first affects cost of equity, which affects E, which affects structure again. This circular problem is addressed in Chapter 2. In this section, we assume cost of equity is found independently, e.g., via CAPM.

1.2.2. Perpetuity, Given Value of Debt

Assuming the value of debt is given is more realistic. Capital structure is then derived after equity value is calculated.

Example 5.
Annual sales remain 200. Costs are 70% of sales. The firm has 50 in debt. Interest equals 8 (16% of 50). Cost of equity is 26%. Corporate tax is 30%.

Using the FCF Method:
Sales: 200
Operational Costs: 140
EBIT: 60
Interest: 0
EBT: 60
Tax: 18
FCF: 42

Now, we face another problem:
	1.	We need weights (debt and equity share) to calculate WACC.
	2.	We know the value of debt (50), but not equity.
	3.	Debt + Equity = Firm Value, which we are trying to calculate.

Thus, we have a similar circular dependency as before.

An analytical solution to the problem is straightforward: we are facing the following system of equations, where V is the value of the company and k is the cost of capital. The first equation shows the value of the entire company as a perpetuity with an annual payment of 42 and an unknown discount rate k. The second shows the formula for WACC, where “V - 50” represents the value of equity. The system can be solved by substituting k = 42/V into the WACC formula. Solving, we find E = 140 after deducting the debt value from the total company value.

The problem can also be solved numerically. First, assume any cost of capital, such as 10%. This would imply:
FCF = 42
k = 10%
V = 420
D = 50
E = 370

However, these values produce a different WACC than 10%. To correct this, enter the WACC formula into an Excel cell, replacing k = 10% with the computed value above. Enable manual iteration in Excel. Set the maximum number of iterations to 1 to observe convergence by pressing F9. The corrected values are:
FCF = 42
k = 22.11%
V = 190
D = 50
E = 140

Using the CF method yields the same result. Income statement:
Sales = 200
Operational Costs = 140
EBIT = 60
Interest = 8
EBT = 52
Tax = 15.6
EAT = CF = 36.4

Given cost of equity = 26%, the resulting equity value is the same as above.

1.2.3. One Period – Given Capital Structure

The assumption of perpetuity simplifies things, but a one-period case is more fundamental, especially as a foundation for multi-period models.

Example 6:
Assume a one-year investment. Initial investment is 200, including working capital (mostly land, to avoid depreciation). EBIT at year-end is 80, and asset value is unchanged. Corporate tax is 30%. Shareholders require a 28% return. Cost of debt (40% financing) is 10%.

Using the FCF method:
Profit after tax = 56
Investment recovered = 200
FCF = 256

WACC = 14.75%
V = FCF / WACC = 173.05
D = 58.67
E = 114.38

Shareholders invest 114.38. The share value rises to 128.43 due to a positive NPV of 14.05 (128.43 - 114.38).
NPV = -I + V = -200 + 214.43 = 14.43
E = I - D + NPV

Using the CF method:
Solve system of equations:
Assets are sold, debt repaid
Capital structure is maintained
Equity equals discounted CF

Example with D = 100:
EBIT = 80
Interest = 10
EBT = 70
Tax = 21
EAT = 49
CF = 149

Discount CF at 28% to get E:
E = 149 / 1.28 = 116.41

Replace D = (0.4/0.6)E = 85.62
E = 128.43

1.2.4. One Period – Given Debt

Using a fixed debt amount simplifies direct valuation, as interest and CF are known. Indirect valuation is more complex.

Example 7:
One-year investment of 200, funded 50% equity and 50% debt. EBIT = 80 at year-end. All funds are recovered. Tax = 30%. Cost of equity = 28%.

Using the FCF method:
EBIT = 80
Tax = 24
Net Profit = 56
FCF = 256

We don’t know WACC, hence can’t find V or E, which in turn prevents knowing the capital structure needed to calculate WACC.

Solve this using equations or Excel iteration. Final values:
V = 216.42
D = 100
E = 116.42

Note that market-value debt ratio is now 46.21%, not the original 50%.

Using the CF method:
EBIT = 80
Interest = 10
EBT = 70
Tax = 21
EAT = 49
CF = 149

Cash flow of 149 plus debt repayment = 249
Discounted at 28% = E = 116.42

1.2.5. Three Periods – Given Structure

This multi-period example focuses on a fixed capital structure. A case with fixed debt but shifting capital structure is discussed in Chapter 2.

Example 8:
Company operates for 3 years. Initial investment = 200 (land). EBIT over years = 80, 90, 70. Land value unchanged. Debt = 40%.
Tax = 30%
kD = 10%
kE = 28%

WACC = 19.6%

Year 1: EBIT = 80, Tax = 24, FCF = 56, PV = 46.82
Year 2: EBIT = 90, Tax = 27, FCF = 63, PV = 44.04
Year 3: EBIT = 70, Tax = 21, Final Cash = 249, PV = 145.55

V = 236.41

Debt = 40% of V = 94.56
Equity = 60% of V = 141.85

At the end of each year, discount future cash flows and divide them into debt and equity components based on the capital structure. This provides a dynamic view of firm value over time and ensures consistency in multi-period valuation.

At the end of year 3, add the value of sold assets and subtract debt repayment to find the cash flow. At the end of year 2, adjust for changes in debt level. Since debt decreases, cash flow is lower than net profit.

Cash flows discounted at 28% yield equity value E = 141.85. Equity values per year can be calculated similarly:

141.85

45.52
136.05

124.92

For instance, 136.05 is derived by discounting 45.52 and 124.92 at 28%. The convergence of CF and FCF methods is strong, though not proof, since CFs were computed using FCF-derived values. Now calculate separately.

Method Based on CF
Let’s revisit the one-period case and extend to multi-period with numerical methods. We’ll simplify by fixing debt at 50 each year. Though the CF formula accounts for debt changes, it’s not relevant here.

Formula input order matters. Begin with debt at end of year 2. Bolded values are safe since they don’t reference other cells.

Conclusion: In the multi-period case with a fixed capital structure, both CF and FCF methods yield identical results. The fixed-debt scenario is addressed in Chapter 2.

1.2.6. Growing Perpetuity – Given Structure
Though assuming perpetually growing cash flows is often criticized, real-world precision is rare. While such growth is unlikely to continue forever, the model is used for simplicity and realism. Growth uncertainty is partially absorbed in the cost of capital. Setting an appropriate growth rate is challenging.

Example 9
Assume the company operates indefinitely. An initial investment of 200 is made in land. EBIT in year 1 is 80, growing at 5% annually. Financing is 40% debt. Other inputs: T = 30%, kD = 10%, kE = 28%.

Method Based on FCF
FCF in year 1 and WACC (19.60%) have already been calculated. Both EBIT and FCF grow at 5%.

Calculate present value of growing perpetuity:
V = FCF / (WACC - g) = 56 / (0.196 - 0.05) = 383.56

Split value by capital structure:
EBIT = 80.00
Tax = 24.00
FCF = 56.00
V = 383.56
D = 153.42
E = 230.14

Method Based on CF
When using this method, we encounter the same logical loop leading to a system of equations as before. Since profit grows at rate g, equity must grow accordingly, and debt must also grow at the same rate to maintain the capital structure. The initial debt D after one year grows to D(1+g). Consequently, CF at the end of year 1 increases by gD. Substituting into the relevant equations yields:

The numerical solution involves setting an initial debt value, say D = 100, calculating cash flow, discounting, and then solving for D based on the target capital structure. The loop is closed by making the D cell formulaically dependent on the result from the capital structure.

EBIT 80.00
D 100.00
Interest 10.00
EBT 70.00
Tax 21.00
EAT 49.00
CF 54.00
E 234.78
D 156.52
V 391.30

With the correct capital structure:
EBIT 80.00
D 153.42
Interest 15.34
EBT 64.66
Tax 19.40
EAT 45.26
CF 52.93
E 230.14
D 153.42
V 383.56

To summarize, the FCF-based method is simpler, though both approaches produce the same result.

1.2.7. Growing Perpetuity – Given Debt
Assume an initial level of debt and that it grows at the same rate as profits. Different growth rates introduce unnecessary complications.

Example 10
Let EBIT = 60 (no depreciation), kD = 6%, kE = 14%, initial debt = 100, T = 30%. Profits and debt both grow at 4%.

Interest = 6.00
Tax = 30% of (EBIT - Interest) = 6.60
EAT = 37.80
gD = 4.00
CF = 41.80
FCF = 42.00

Gordon’s model or WACC (12.11%) can be used to value the firm equivalently.

1.2.8. General Case – Given Structure
Often, forecasts exist for 5 years, after which operations are assumed to follow a growing perpetuity. This simplifies modeling: continuation value replaces asset liquidation.

1.2.9. APV – Given Structure
A firm is treated as a portfolio of equity and debt. Given the costs of debt and equity, compute the cost of capital.

APV discounts FCF at the unleveraged cost of capital and then adjusts for tax shields, flotation costs, and distress costs. It’s more flexible than embedding all adjustments in the discount rate.

Example 11
Company X earns EBIT = 200 indefinitely, pays 30% tax, and is financed 30% by debt. kD = 10%, kE = 16%.

EBIT = 200
Tax = 60
FCF = 140
Cost of capital kA = 14.2%

First, find the value of the unleveraged firm by discounting FCF at kA:
PV(FCF) = 985.92

Debt = 30% of APV
Interest = 10% of debt
Tax shield (TS) = 30% of interest

Challenge: TS depends on APV, but APV includes TS. Three views on discounting the TS:
	1.	If structure is fixed, TS should be discounted at kA
	2.	Discount the first TS at kD, subsequent at kA
	3.	Discount all TS at kD

Approach 1:
Discount TS at kA
APV = PV(FCF) + PV(TS)

Approach 2 (Miles-Ezzell):
Discount first TS at kD, others at kA
Use WACCME instead of WACC

Iteration Method for APV:
Start with PV(FCF) = 985.92
Assume APV = 985.92
Debt = 295.77
Interest = 29.58
TS = 8.87
PV(TS) = 64.87
New APV = 1055.36
Updated Debt = 316.61
Interest = 31.66
TS = 9.50
PV(TS) = 69.44

Converges to:
APV = 1055.36

1.2.10. Company Valuation via Iterations
Perpetuity valuation through system of equations is viable. In real-world valuations, multiple parameters and periods require numerical iterations. For a given year t, to find V requires WACC, which needs E, which requires kE, which itself depends on E. This creates nested logical loops.

The recursive structure of the formulas allows capital costs and cash flows to reflect each other dynamically. Using the FTE method instead of FTF adds complexity with loops across rows and columns. Recursive backward calculation is necessary. Without iterations, WACC is improperly weighted and valuation inconsistent.

The recursive method correctly incorporates the dependency of cost of capital on capital structure. Logical loops are solved, and simplifications like perpetuity tail and equating expected with required returns are reasonable approximations.

1.3. Growth
1.3.1. Growth of Value
A company creates value by undertaking positive NPV projects. Example: equity-financed firm, cost of capital = 20%, generates CF = 300 annually. Value = 300 / 0.2 = 1500

Invest 150 in a project generating 50 per year. Value = 50 / 0.2 = 250
New firm value = 1500 + 250 = 1750

If project earns 25 per year: Value = 25 / 0.2 = 125
Then: 1500 + 125 = 1625
Value decreases because return < cost of capital

Value creation requires profit above the capital cost. Most positive NPV projects arise from:
	1.	Technological advantage
	2.	Organizational advantage
	3.	Monopoly power

These advantages are short-lived due to competitive pressure.

1.3.2. Growth vs Value
Company profits fund growth through reinvestment or can be distributed as dividends. Reinvestment and dividend payouts are opposing decisions. Only positive NPV reinvestments enhance shareholder value.

Example: Company with 25,000 profit yearly, cost of capital = 15%, all paid out as dividends. Value = 25,000 / 0.15 = 166,667
Shares = 1,000 → Share price = 166.67

Case 1: Reinvest year 1 profit into a project earning 15% (same as cost of capital), yielding 3,750 annually from year 2.

Year 1 dividend = 0
Year 2+ dividends = 28,750

PV of dividends remains 166,667. No value created.

Case 2: Project earns 20%, returns 5,000 annually. Year 2+ dividends = 30,000
New value = 30,000 / 0.15 = 200,000
Discounted to year 0 → Increased firm value due to positive NPV reinvestment.
The value of the company is the present value of all future cash flows, so we follow the calculation procedure from the previous case. The reinvestment positively affects the value of the company and share price. The present value of the company has grown by 7,246.38 (that is 7.25 per share) thanks to growth opportunities. The amount (7.25) is denoted by PVGO (present value of growth opportunities). This example is a starting point for analyzing PVGO more broadly. Growth higher than zero increases the share price, while investment with a return equal to the cost of capital generates zero growth. Growth potential, or PVGO, can be defined as the portion of share price attributable to reinvestment opportunities. The share price is thus composed of the value without growth and the additional component driven by PVGO.

1.3.3. Dividend Policy and Growth
Let us examine how dividend policy or reinvestment policy influences the value and growth of a company.

Example 12
Consider a firm fully financed by equity (book value = 100), generating perpetual cash flows with ROE = 30% and a cost of capital of 25%. The firm earns 30 annually and can reinvest part of it in a project earning 30% return. If the firm does not reinvest, the 30 is distributed as dividends and the firm value is 120. If it reinvests 16.67% of profits to increase assets to 105, only 25 is paid to shareholders. Growth is defined as ROE times the reinvestment ratio. The next year, profit rises to 31.5, and 83.33% is distributed (5% more than previously). Sustained growth pushes firm value to 125. At 10% growth, value reaches 133.3; at 15%, it reaches 150. Corresponding PVGO values per share are: 0, 5.00, 13.33, and 30.00. Companies with high PVGO are classified as growth companies. Investors in these firms trade current dividends for higher future payouts, but delayed returns carry risk. If growth is not sustained, the expected value may not materialize. In practice, high growth is rarely sustained. Eventually, markets saturate and returns diminish. The model best simulates moderate, GDP-like growth. High dynamic growth requires different analysis.

1.3.4. Growth Versus Cost of Capital
To find a public company’s cost of capital in a zero-growth scenario, one can equate dividends and EPS. With constant growth, the formula adjusts accordingly. However, real-world growth is rarely stable. Returning to the PVGO framework, suppose share price is 50, PVGO is 50, and earnings per share is 10. Solving for the cost of capital becomes a challenge due to PVGO estimation.

P/E ratio is often used as a shortcut. In this case, P/E = 5, so cost of capital = 1/P/E = 20%. Growth potential raises share price and thus increases the implied cost of capital. The higher the share price contribution from PVGO, the higher the return investors demand, reflecting greater risk. If a company is unprofitable, its market price must be justified by expected future profits. In this case, PVGO can exceed the share price. For example, if expected future profit is 20, the value (20/0.2 = 100) may exceed the current share price of 50. Hence, investment pays off when the project’s return exceeds the firm’s cost of capital. These opportunities are rare and difficult to sustain under competitive pressure.

1.3.5. Residual Value
Expected cash flows are the foundation of valuation models, but forecasting 7, 9, or 15 years ahead is unreliable. Assuming a firm has a finite life leads to assigning zero value beyond a certain point, which is unrealistic. Firms are intended to operate long-term. A better approach is to define a finite forecast horizon for detailed cash flow estimation, and assign a residual value beyond that point. This typically involves modeling post-horizon cash flows as a growing perpetuity.

Three approaches are commonly used for estimating residual value:
	1.	Assuming post-horizon cash flows grow at a constant rate, allowing application of Gordon’s model. The simplicity is an advantage, but the model is sensitive to the growth rate assumption.
	2.	Using market ratios from a comparable mature company expected to be at the same stage in the future. For example, applying a P/E ratio of 8 to forecasted profits, or an MV/BV ratio of 2 to future book value.
	3.	Estimating the duration of competitive advantage. Once the advantage ends, growth opportunities vanish, simplifying the valuation. The residual value is then computed using a no-growth perpetuity model.

1.4. Real Options
Expected cash flows form the basis of valuation, but uncertainty always remains. Hence the term “expected.” During a project’s life, outcomes may vary. If results are poor (e.g., demand falls), the firm may abandon the project. If results are strong, it may expand. This type of flexibility, inherent to some projects, is not captured by traditional valuation methods.
Both decisions—to withdraw after failure or expand after success—have financial consequences and depend on uncertain future events. The similarity with options theory is clear. A buyer of a put may exercise it if the price of the underlying asset falls, and a call buyer may benefit if the price rises. The analogy runs deeper in business, where the term “real options” applies to options based on non-financial assets.

Consider a company conducting market research—it essentially buys an option. If the research yields positive results, the company invests and launches the product. The research cost is the option premium, and the investment at future time T is the exercise price. The payoff is the difference between the discounted expected cash flows and the investment: max(0, R(T) - K), where R(T) is the value of expected future cash flows and K is the investment cost. If the market research is unfavorable, the company doesn’t invest, and the option expires worthless. Other real options include the ability to expand operations or exit early. A classic example is oil exploration or R&D, where investments depend on early findings. Conversely, put options provide downside protection when a project underperforms, allowing the firm to scale back operations.

Real options are highly specific, and unlike financial options, they can’t be traded, hedged, or easily replicated. If the real option closely mirrors a financial one, with a perfectly correlated underlying asset, standard financial option valuation methods apply. Otherwise, the correlation gap leads to valuation errors.

1.4.1. Option to Abandon
Example 13.
A project requires a 100 investment. It may yield annual cash flows of 60 (success) or 10 (failure) for three years, each with 50% probability. At any point, operations can be halted and assets sold for 80. The cost of capital is 30%. Using expected values without factoring abandonment, the NPV is negative (-0.02). Including the abandonment option—terminating after year 1 if the pessimistic outcome occurs—improves NPV to 7.31.

Components of this real option (option to abandon):
	1.	Maturity: end of year 1
	2.	Underlying asset: project value at year 1. In the pessimistic scenario, project value = 70.95, while asset sale = 90
	3.	Exercise price: 90 (value recouped by abandoning)
	4.	Payoff: max(0, K - R(T)) = 19.05 if abandoned in pessimistic scenario
	5.	Option premium: value of abandonment flexibility = 7.33

This added value means it would be rational to invest 105 (including 5 for the option) instead of 100, for the flexibility to exit.

1.4.2. Option to Abandon Revisited
Example 14.
A project needs a 100 investment, and after one year, it yields either 130 or 95 with 50% chance each. The company may exit and sell assets for 100, assuming suitable infrastructure. The cost of capital is 30% and the risk-free rate is 5%. Using expected values, the option is worth 2.27. Using financial options theory, the option is valued via replication. Compute delta from the change in option payoffs relative to the change in project payoffs.

Portfolio replicating the option:
In the up scenario: stock = -18.57, bond = 18.57, total = 0
In the down scenario: stock = -13.57, bond = 18.57, total = 5

Because the portfolio mimics the option’s payoffs (0 or 5), their present values must be equal. This gives the option a value of 3.40. The discrepancy between 2.27 and 3.40 stems from limitations in both methods—physical probability assumptions versus difficulty of replication in real-world business.

1.4.3. Option to Expand
Example 15.
A project needs 100 in upfront investment and yields cash flows of 80 (success) or 20 (failure) for three years, with 50% probabilities. At the end of year 1, an additional investment of 70 can double sales in years 2 and 3. The cost of capital is 30%. Without the expansion option, NPVs are 45.29 (success) and -63.68 (failure), with a net NPV of -9.19. With the expansion option, cash flows become 10, 160, 160 in the optimistic case, raising NPV to 75.19. The option value is 5.76.

Key components:
	1.	Maturity: end of year 1
	2.	Underlying asset: project value = 108.88 or 27.22
	3.	Exercise price: 70
	4.	Call payoff: max(0, R(T) - K) = 38.88 in the positive scenario
	5.	Option premium: 14.95

Such options are common in oil exploration or R&D, where significant early-stage investment is contingent on future outcomes.

1.5. Case Study – Documents Pro Forma
A firm’s value is based on its current and future cash flow generation. Valuation begins with estimating those cash flows over a forecast horizon. In the case of Tea.dot—a high-growth, reinvestment-heavy startup—analysts forecasted performance over five years and calculated free cash flow and terminal value. Pro forma financials (income statement, balance sheet, cash flow) required many assumptions.

Before forecasting, the company’s current financial health must be reviewed. Analysts focus on forward-looking performance. Comparative analysis is the basis of traditional evaluation, as raw figures alone lack meaning.

Comparison framework:
	1.	Historical performance (trend)
	2.	Industry averages

Benchmarking example:
Industry vs. Tea.dot (2008):
Quick ratio: 1.0 vs. 2.39
Current ratio: 1.6 vs. 2.64
Liabilities/Equity: 99.7% vs. 358%
DSO: 24.1 vs. 79.56
Total asset turnover: 33.4% vs. 93%
ROA: 7.4% vs. 11%
ROE: 16.5% vs. 48%

Findings:
Liquidity is strong (quick and current ratios OK)
Leverage is high/risky (liabilities/equity)
Receivables collection is poor (DSO)
Efficiency, profitability, and return metrics are solid

This benchmarking step is critical before generating forward-looking projections.

The company’s liquidity position is very strong. However, it also means that it has a lot of money tied up in nonproductive assets such as cash. The company should improve cash management and inventory control. The average collection period is very long—80 days—indicating the need to expedite receivables collection or at least monitor the receivables position more closely. The turnover of total assets is high, showing that the company generates a solid volume of business given its asset base. However, concerns arise around the company’s gearing and investment strategy. Tea.dot is highly leveraged. Creditors may be hesitant to lend more, and management risks financial instability by further increasing debt. Profitability ratios are acceptable, but the improved return on equity is mainly due to increased leverage.

Over the past three years, Tea.dot underwent major expansion, with fixed assets increasing nearly 200% annually. This growth was largely financed by debt. While sales increased, margins declined. The firm was fortunate not to face higher interest costs. Internal cash flow does not appear to finance investment effectively, as asset growth does not match debt increases. The debt ratio increased from 26% to 71% and then to 78%, indicating aggressive borrowing. The company has pursued an ambitious expansion strategy fueled primarily by debt. Fortunately, demand has not declined. The firm can continue operating successfully if adverse conditions are avoided, but it must generate significant profits to reduce leverage. Despite rising sales, profitability has not improved. The only ratio showing major growth is ROE, driven largely by debt-financed operations.

Based on the financial analysis, a reasonable set of managerial assumptions for Tea.dot includes moderate sales growth due to a slowing economy and expected recession. Sales growth should be 9%, then 5%, 2%, and then flat. No additional long-term debt should be taken. The quick ratio is too high, reflecting excessive cash holdings, although this might be partly justified. The company should cut administrative and overhead costs to no more than 30% of sales. Interest rates are expected to fall gradually, consistent with central bank policy. A stable dividend policy should be maintained.

A complete set of assumptions should now be embedded in the balance sheet and income statement and linked to the latest financial data. While this is relatively straightforward, the challenge is ensuring that the balance sheet balances. New assumptions alter almost every component. A common solution is to use debt (often short-term) as a plug to reconcile differences. The technical step is critical in preparing a smooth pro forma balance sheet.

In the example above, long-term debt acts as the plug. In years 1 through 4, assets and liabilities are balanced by calculating debt using a formula. However, this can result in negative debt if retained earnings grow substantially—an accounting impossibility. The formula should be revised to prevent negative debt. If assets exceed liabilities, the surplus is allocated to cash, and the cash forecast formula is adjusted accordingly.

In practice, the same method is used, though with far more complex formulas. Once the pro forma statements are built, cash flows can be derived using the method outlined in Section 1.2.
