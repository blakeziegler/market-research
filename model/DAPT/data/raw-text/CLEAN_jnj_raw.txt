At the center of Johnson & Johnson is its dedication to innovation.

Johnson & Johnson’s long-standing success has built an unmatched stream of brand loyalty. Across generations, consumers continue to prefer Johnson & Johnson products, reinforcing its reputable image as a leading healthcare brand.

Company Overview
Company History
Founded in 1886, Johnson & Johnson is the premier healthcare and consumer goods company. Its mission is to deliver affordable, accessible products that promote health and wellness. It began by selling manuals on sterile surgery techniques, first aid kits, and maternity kits. Products such as dental floss and Band-Aids emerged in 1921. In 1931, it released its first pharmaceutical drug. By 1949, Johnson & Johnson expanded into medical devices such as sterile sutures.

Operating Segments
The company operates in three main segments:
	1.	Consumer Products (18% of FY17 revenue): baby care, oral care, beauty, over-the-counter pharmaceuticals, women’s health, and wound care.
	2.	Medical Devices and Diagnostics (35%): focuses on immunology, vaccines, oncology, cardiovascular, and metabolism.
	3.	Pharmaceutical (47%): orthopaedics, surgery, cardiovascular, diabetes care, eye health.
With over 260 subsidiaries in more than 60 countries, Johnson & Johnson enjoys strong global brand recognition.

Industry Overview
Each segment faces favorable industry trends. Consumer products are near maturity but benefit from growing demand for natural skincare. Medical devices are expected to grow due to an aging population and modest input costs. Pharmaceuticals should see strong growth from increased demand for biologic drugs and expansion in emerging markets.

Buyer markets are growing due to a strong economy and rising disposable income. Pharmacy and drug store revenue is expected to grow ~2% annually, similar to supermarkets. Hospitals will see ~3.5% annual revenue growth. Brand-name drug sales are also forecast to grow 2% annually.

Against the industry, Johnson & Johnson performs well across several metrics:
EPS: 6.57 vs. 4.47

P/E Ratio: 22.0 vs. 23.8
YoY Revenue Growth: 6.34% vs. 7.77%
Dividend Yield: 2.60% vs. 2.37%

Though revenue growth is slightly lower, Johnson & Johnson offers better EPS, lower debt, and higher dividends.

Growth Factor: Innovation
Consumer Products: Neutrogena Skin360 & Skin Scanner lets users track facial changes via smartphone app. Integrated AI provides analysis and connects users with dermatologists.

Pharmaceutical Drugs: Johnson & Johnson develops biologic drugs using microorganisms to treat chronic illnesses. Remicade, a top-selling biologic drug, is protected from generics, only facing biosimilars.

Medical Devices: Subsidiary DePuy Synthes introduced the Concorde Lift, an expandable spacer for spinal fusion surgery. By 2020, 3.4 million people are expected to undergo such procedures annually.

Growth Factor: Competitive Edge
The Johnson & Johnson Institute operates over 20 centers across five continents, educating 125,000+ healthcare professionals annually using VR simulators, online seminars, and classroom sessions.

C-STATS is a personalized performance platform offering instant feedback to surgeons on their technical skills. It improves patient outcomes and operational efficiency.

Johnson & Johnson also introduced CompAC, the first Compassionate Use Advisory Committee. Comprised of ethicists, doctors, and advocates, it advises on non-FDA-approved drug use for complex illnesses.

Growth Factor: Strong Brand Value
With over 130 years of trust, Johnson & Johnson remains a top consumer choice. Band-Aid is synonymous with adhesive bandages, and Johnson’s Baby Brand is a market leader among families.

Even during recessions, the company maintains strong sales. From 2003–2012, revenue remained stable and margins consistent despite economic downturns.

Risks and Mitigants
Decline in Private Health Insurance Coverage
Could hurt pharmaceutical and medical device sales as more patients turn to generics. However, the decline is expected to be slow over the next five years.

Recession
Would primarily affect the Consumer Products segment, the smallest division. Historically, Johnson & Johnson has maintained stable sales during recessions.

Trade War
Though trade tensions exist, China eliminated tariffs on drug imports as of May 1, 2018. The Pharmaceutical segment should remain unaffected.
