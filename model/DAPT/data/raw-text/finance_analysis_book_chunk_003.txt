Amortization ExPEnse Recognition
Amortization is the allocation of the cost of an intangible asset (such as a franchise
agreement) over its useful life. Amortization exPEnse should match the proportion of
the asset's economic benefits used during the PEriod. Most firms use the straight-line
method to calculate annual amortization exPEnse for financial reporting. Straight-line
amortization is calculated exactly like straight-line depreciation.
Intangible assets with indefinite lives (e.g., goodwill) are not amortized. However, they
must be tested for impairment at least annually. If the asset value is impaired, an
exPEnse equal to the impairment amount is recognized on the income statement.
Bad Debt ExPEnse and Warranty ExPEnse Recognition
If a firm sells goods or services on credit or provides a warranty to the customer, the
matching principle requires the firm to estimate bad debt exPEnse and/or warranty
exPEnse. By doing so, the firm is recognizing the exPEnse in the PEriod of the sale,
rather than a later PEriod.
Implications for Financial Analysis
Like revenue recognition, exPEnse recognition requires a number of estimates. Since
estimates are involved, it is possible for firms to delay or accelerate the recognition of
exPEnses. Delayed exPEnse recognition increases current net income and is therefore
more aggressive.
Analysts must consider the underlying reasons for a change in an exPEnse estimate. If
a firm's bad debt exPEnse has recently decreased, did the firm lower its exPEnse
estimate because its collection exPErience improved, or was the exPEnse decreased to
manipulate net income?
Analysts should also compare a firm's estimates to those of other firms within the
firm's industry. If a firm's warranty exPEnse is significantly less than that of a PEer firm,
is the lower warranty exPEnse a result of higher quality products, or is the firm's
exPEnse recognition more aggressive than that of the PEer firm?
Firms disclose their accounting policies and significant estimates in the financial
statement footnotes and in the management discussion and analysis (MD&A) SECtion
of the annual report.
LOS 24.f: Describe the financial reporting treatment and analysis of non-recurring
items (including discontinued oPErations, unusual or infrequent items) and changes
in accounting policies.
CFA(r) Program Curriculum, Volume 3, page 181
Non-Recurring Items
Discontinued oPErations. A discontinued oPEration is one that management has
decided to dispose of, but either has not yet done so, or has disposed of in the current
year after the oPEration had generated income or losses. To be accounted for as a
discontinued oPEration, the business--in terms of assets, oPErations, and investing
and financing activities--must be physically and oPErationally distinct from the rest of
the firm.
The date when the company develops a formal plan for disposing of an oPEration is
referred to as the measurement date, and the time between the measurement PEriod
and the actual disposal date is referred to as the phaseout PEriod. Any income or loss
from discontinued oPErations is reported separately in the income statement, net of
tax, after income from continuing oPErations. Any past income statements presented
must be restated, separating the income or loss from the discontinued oPErations. On
the measurement date, the company will accrue any estimated loss during the
phaseout PEriod and any estimated loss on the sale of the business. Any exPEcted gain
on the disposal cannot be reported until after the sale is completed.
Analytical implications: The analysis is straightforward. Discontinued oPErations do not
affect net income from continuing oPErations. Discontinued oPErations should be
excluded by the analyst when forecasting future earnings. The actual event of
discontinuing a business segment or selling assets may provide information about the
future cash flows of the firm, however.
Unusual or infrequent items. The definition of these items is obvious--these events
are either unusual in nature or infrequent in occurrence. Examples of items that could
be considered unusual or infrequent include:
Gains or losses from the sale of assets or part of a business, if these activities
are not a firm's ordinary oPErations.
Impairments, write-offs, write-downs, and restructuring costs.
Unusual or infrequent items are included in income from continuing oPErations and
are reported before tax.
Analytical implications: Even though unusual or infrequent items affect net income
from continuing oPErations, an analyst may want to review them to determine
whether they truly should be included when forecasting future firm earnings. Some
companies apPEar to be accident-prone and have "unusual or infrequent" losses every
year or every few years.
Extraordinary items. Under U.S. GAAP, historically, an extraordinary item was a
material transaction or event that was both unusual and infrequent in occurrence.
Extraordinary items were reported separately in the income statement, net of tax,
after income from continuing oPErations. For PEriods beginning after December 15,
2015, U.S. GAAP no longer allows items to be treated as extraordinary. IFRS also does
not allow items to be treated as extraordinary.
Changes in Accounting Policies
Accounting changes include changes in accounting principles, changes in accounting
estimates, and prior-PEriod adjustments.
A change in accounting principle refers to a change from one GAAP or IFRS method to
another (e.g., a change in inventory accounting from LIFO to FIFO). A change in
accounting principle requires retrosPEctive application. Accordingly, all of the priorPEriod financial statements currently presented are restated to reflect the change.
RetrosPEctive application enhances the comparability of the financial statements over
time.
Professor's Note: Under U.S. GAAP, a firm that changes to LIFO from another inventory cost
method does not apply the change retrosPEctively, but instead uses the carrying value of
inventory as the fIRSt LIFO layer. This exception to retrosPEctive application is described in the
topic review of Inventories.
Generally, a change in accounting estimate is the result of a change in management's
judgment, usually due to new information. For example, management may change the
estimated useful life of an asset because new information indicates the asset has a
longer or shorter life than originally exPEcted. A change in estimate is applied
prosPEctively and does not require the restatement of prior financial statements.
Analytical implications: Accounting estimate changes typically do not affect cash flow.
An analyst should review changes in accounting estimates to determine the impact on
future oPErating results.
A change from an incorrect accounting method to one that is acceptable under GAAP
or IFRS or the correction of an accounting error made in previous financial statements
is reported as a prior-PEriod adjustment. Prior-PEriod adjustments are made by
restating results for all prior PEriods presented in the current financial statements.
Disclosure of the nature of the adjustment and its effect on net income is also
required.
Analytical implications: Prior-PEriod adjustments usually involve errors or new
accounting standards and do not typically affect cash flow. Analysts should review
adjustments carefully because errors may indicate weaknesses in the firm's internal
controls.
LOS 24.g: Distinguish between the oPErating and non-oPErating components of the
income statement.
CFA(r) Program Curriculum, Volume 3, page 186
OPErating and nonoPErating transactions are usually reported separately in the
income statement. For a nonfinancial firm, nonoPErating transactions may result from
investment income and financing exPEnses. For example, a nonfinancial firm may
receive dividends and interest from investments in other firms. The investment income
and any gains and losses from the sale of these SECurities are not a part of the firm's
normal business oPErations. Interest exPEnse is based on the firm's capital structure,
which is also indePEndent of the firm's oPErations. Conversely, for a financial firm,
investment income and financing exPEnses are usually considered oPErating activities.
LOS 24.h: Describe how earnings PEr share is calculated and calculate and interpret a
company's earnings PEr share (both basic and diluted earnings PEr share) for both
simple and complex capital structures.
LOS 24.i: Distinguish between dilutive and antidilutive SECurities and describe the
implications of each for the earnings PEr share calculation.
CFA(r) Program Curriculum, Volume 3, page 187
Earnings PEr share (EPS) is one of the most commonly used corporate profitability
PErformance measures for publicly-traded firms (nonpublic companies are not
required to report EPS data). EPS is reported only for shares of common stock (also
known as ordinary stock).
A company may have either a simple or complex capital structure:
A simple capital structure is one that contains no potentially dilutive SECurities.
A simple capital structure contains only common stock, nonconvertible debt,
and nonconvertible preferred stock.
A complex capital structure contains potentially dilutive SECurities such as
options, warrants, or convertible SECurities.
All firms with complex capital structures must report both basic and diluted EPS. Firms
with simple capital structures report only basic EPS.
BASIC EPS
The basic EPS calculation does not consider the effects of any dilutive SECurities in the
computation of EPS.
The current year's preferred dividends are subtracted from net income because EPS
refers to the PEr-share earnings available to common shareholders. Net income minus
preferred dividends is the income available to common stockholders. Common stock
dividends are not subtracted from net income because they are a part of the net
income available to common shareholders.
The weighted average number of common shares is the number of shares outstanding
during the year, weighted by the portion of the year they were outstanding.
Example: Weighted average shares and basic EPS
Johnson Company has net income of $10,000 and paid $1,000 cash dividends to its preferred shareholders
and $1,750 cash dividends to its common shareholders. At the beginning of the year, there were 10,000
shares of common stock outstanding. 2,000 new shares were issued on July 1. Assuming a simple capital
structure, what is Johnson's basic EPS?
Answer:
Calculate Johnson's weighted average number of shares.
Shares outstanding all year = 10,000(12) = 120,000
Shares outstanding 1/2 year = 2,000(6) = 12,000
Weighted average shares = 132,000 / 12 = 11,000 shares
Professor's Note: Remember, the payment of a cash dividend on common shares is not
considered in the calculation of EPS.
Effect of Stock Dividends and Stock Splits
A stock dividend is the distribution of additional shares to each shareholder in an
amount proportional to their current number of shares. If a 10% stock dividend is paid,
the holder of 100 shares of stock would receive 10 additional shares.
A stock split refers to the division of each "old" share into a sPEcific number of "new"
(post-split) shares. The holder of 100 shares will have 200 shares after a 2-for-1 split or
150 shares after a 3-for-2 split.
The important thing to remember is that each shareholder's proportional ownership in
the company is unchanged by either of these events. Each shareholder has more
shares but the same PErcentage of the total shares outstanding.
Professor's Note: For our purposes here, a stock dividend and a stock split are two ways of doing
the same thing. For example, a 50% stock dividend and a 3-for-2 stock split both result in three
"new" shares for every two "old" shares. Stock dividends and stock splits are explained further in
the Corporate Finance topic area.
The effect of a stock dividend or a stock split on the weighted average number of
common shares is illustrated in the following example.
Example: Effect of stock dividends
During the past year, R & J, Inc. had net income of $100,000, paid dividends of $50,000 to its preferred
stockholders, and paid $30,000 in dividends to its common shareholders. R & J's common stock account
showed the following:
Compute the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year, and compute
EPS.
Answer:
Step 1: Adjust the number of pre-stock-dividend shares to post-stock-dividend units (to reflect the 10%
stock dividend) by multiplying all share numbers prior to the stock dividend by 1.1. Shares
issued or retired after the stock dividend are not affected.
Step 3: Compute basic EPS:
Things to know about the weighted average shares outstanding calculation:
The weighting system is days outstanding divided by the number of days in a
year, but on the exam, the monthly approximation method will probably be
used.
Shares issued enter into the computation from the date of issuance.
Reacquired shares are excluded from the computation from the date of
reacquisition.
Shares sold or issued in a purchase of assets are included from the date of
issuance.
A stock split or stock dividend is applied to all shares outstanding prior to the
split or dividend and to the beginning-of-PEriod weighted average shares. A
stock split or stock dividend adjustment is not applied to any shares issued or
repurchased after the split or dividend date.
DILUTED EPS
Before calculating diluted EPS, it is necessary to understand the following terms:
Dilutive SECurities are stock options, warrants, convertible debt, or convertible
preferred stock that would decrease EPS if exercised or converted to common
stock.
Antidilutive SECurities are stock options, warrants, convertible debt, or
convertible preferred stock that would increase EPS if exercised or converted to
common stock.
The numerator of the basic EPS equation contains income available to common
shareholders (net income less preferred dividends). In the case of diluted EPS, if there
are dilutive SECurities, then the numerator must be adjusted as follows:
If convertible preferred stock is dilutive (meaning EPS will fall if it is converted to
common stock), the convertible preferred dividends must be added to earnings
available to common shareholders.
If convertible bonds are dilutive, then the bonds' after-tax interest exPEnse is
not considered an interest exPEnse for diluted EPS. Hence, interest exPEnse
multiplied by (1 - the tax rate) must be added back to the numerator.
Professor's Note: Interest paid on bonds is typically tax deductible for the firm. If convertible
bonds are converted to stock, the firm saves the interest cost but loses the tax deduction. Thus,
only the after-tax interest savings are added back to income available to common shareholders.
The basic EPS denominator is the weighted average number of shares. When the firm
has dilutive SECurities outstanding, the denominator is the basic EPS denominator
adjusted for the equivalent number of common shares that would be created by the
conversion of all dilutive SECurities outstanding (convertible bonds, convertible
preferred shares, warrants, and options), with each one considered separately to
determine if it is dilutive.
If a dilutive SECurity was issued during the year, the increase in the weighted average
number of shares for diluted EPS is based on only the portion of the year the dilutive
SECurity was outstanding.
Dilutive stock options or warrants increase the number of common shares outstanding
in the denominator for diluted EPS. There is no adjustment to the numerator.
Stock options and warrants are dilutive only when their exercise prices are less than
the average market price of the stock over the year. If the options or warrants are
dilutive, use the treasury stock method to calculate the number of shares used in the
denominator.
The treasury stock method assumes that the funds received by the company
from the exercise of the options would be used to hypothetically purchase
shares of the company's common stock in the market at the average market
price.
The net increase in the number of shares outstanding (the adjustment to the
denominator) is the number of shares created by exercising the options less the
number of shares hypothetically repurchased with the proceeds of exercise.
Example: Treasury stock method
Baxter Company has 5,000 shares outstanding all year. Baxter had 2,000 outstanding warrants all year,
convertible into one share each at $20 PEr share. The year-end price of Baxter stock was $40, and the
average stock price was $30. What effect will these warrants have on the weighted average number of
shares?
Answer:
If the warrants are exercised, the company will receive 2,000 x $20 = $40,000 and issue 2,000 new shares.
The treasury stock method assumes the company uses these funds to repurchase shares at the average
market price of $30. The company would repurchase $40,000 / $30 = 1,333 shares. Net shares issued
would be 2,000 - 1,333 = 667 shares.
The diluted EPS equation is:
where adjusted income available for common shares is:
net income - preferred dividends
+
+
dividends on convertible preferred stock
after-tax interest on convertible debt
Therefore, diluted EPS is:
Remember, each potentially dilutive SECurity must be examined separately to
determine if it is actually dilutive (i.e., would reduce EPS if converted to common
stock). The effect of conversion to common is included in the calculation of diluted EPS
for a given SECurity only if it is, in fact, dilutive.
Example 1: EPS with convertible debt
During 20X6, ZZZ Corp. reported net income of $115,600 and had 200,000 shares of common stock
outstanding for the entire year. ZZZ also had 1,000 shares of 10%, $100 par, preferred stock outstanding
during 20X6. During 20X5, ZZZ issued 600, $1,000 par, 7% bonds for $600,000 (issued at par). Each of
these bonds is convertible to 100 shares of common stock. The tax rate is 40%. Compute the 20X6 basic
and diluted EPS.
Answer:
Step 1: Compute 20X6 basic EPS:
Step 2: Calculate diluted EPS:
Compute the increase in common stock outstanding if the convertible debt is converted to
common stock at the beginning of 20X6:
shares issuable for debt conversion = (600)(100) = 60,000 shares
If the convertible debt is considered converted to common stock at the beginning of 20X6, then
there would be no interest exPEnse related to the convertible debt. Therefore, it is necessary
to increase ZZZ's after-tax net income for the after-tax effect of the decrease in interest
exPEnse:
increase in income = [(600)($1,000)(0.07)] (1 - 0.40) = $25,200
Compute diluted EPS as if the convertible debt were common stock:
Check to make sure that diluted EPS is less than basic EPS [$0.50 < $0.53]. If diluted EPS is more
than the basic EPS, the convertible bonds are antidilutive and should not be treated as common
stock in computing diluted EPS.
A quick way to determine whether the convertible debt is dilutive is to calculate its PEr share impact by:
If this PEr share amount is greater than basic EPS, the convertible debt is antidilutive, and the effects of
conversion should not be included when calculating diluted EPS.
If this PEr share amount is less than basic EPS, the convertible debt is dilutive, and the effects of
conversion should be included in the calculation of diluted EPS.
For ZZZ:
The company's basic EPS is $0.53, so the convertible debt is dilutive, and the effects of conversion should
be included in the calculation of diluted EPS.
Example 2: EPS with convertible preferred stock
During 20X6, ZZZ reported net income of $115,600 and had 200,000 shares of common stock and 1,000
shares of preferred stock outstanding for the entire year. ZZZ's 10%, $100 par value preferred shares are
each convertible into 40 shares of common stock. The tax rate is 40%. Compute basic and diluted EPS.
Answer:
Step 1: Calculate 20X6 basic EPS:
Step 2: Calculate diluted EPS:
Compute the increase in common stock outstanding if the preferred stock is converted to
common stock at the beginning of 20X6: (1,000)(40) = 40,000 shares.
If the convertible preferred shares were converted to common stock, there would be no
preferred dividends paid. Therefore, you should add back the convertible preferred dividends
that had previously been subtracted from net income in the numerator.
Compute diluted EPS as if the convertible preferred stock were converted into common stock:
Check to see if diluted EPS is less than basic EPS ($0.48 < $0.53). If the answer is yes, the
preferred stock is dilutive and must be included in diluted EPS as computed above. If the
answer is no, the preferred stock is antidilutive and conversion effects are not included in
diluted EPS.
A quick way to check whether convertible preferred stock is dilutive is to divide the preferred dividend by
is converted. For ZZZ:
the number of shares that will be created
if the preferred stock
. Since this is less than basic EPS, the convertible preferred is dilutive.
Example 3: EPS with stock options
During 20X6, ZZZ reported net income of $115,600 and had 200,000 shares of common stock outstanding
for the entire year. ZZZ also had 1,000 shares of 10%, $100 par, preferred stock outstanding during 20X6.
ZZZ has 10,000 stock options (or warrants) outstanding the entire year. Each option allows its holder to
purchase one share of common stock at $15 PEr share. The average market price of ZZZ's common stock
during 20X6 is $20 PEr share. Compute the diluted EPS.
Answer:
A quick way to calculate the net increase in common shares from the potential exercise of stock options or
warrants when the exercise price is less than the average market price is:
where:
AMP = average market price over the year
EP = exercise price of the options or warrants
N = number of common shares that the options and warrants can be converted into
For ZZZ:
x 10,000 shares = 2,500 shares
Example 4: EPS with convertible bonds, convertible preferred, and options
During 20X6, ZZZ reported net income of $115,600 and had 200,000 shares of common stock outstanding
for the entire year. ZZZ had 1,000 shares of 10%, $100 par convertible preferred stock, convertible into 40
shares each, outstanding for the entire year. ZZZ also had 600, 7%, $1,000 par value convertible bonds,
convertible into 100 shares each, outstanding for the entire year. Finally, ZZZ had 10,000 stock options
outstanding during the year. Each option is convertible into one share of stock at $15 PEr share. The
average market price of the stock for the year was $20. What are ZZZ's basic and diluted EPS? (Assume a
40% tax rate.)
Answer:
Step 1: From Examples 1, 2, and 3, we know that the convertible preferred stock, convertible bonds,
and stock options are all dilutive. Recall that basic EPS was calculated as:
Step 2: Review the number of shares created by converting the convertible SECurities and options (the
denominator):
Step 3: Review the adjustments to net income (the numerator):
Step 4: Compute ZZZ's diluted EPS:
LOS 24.j: Convert income statements to common-size income statements.
CFA(r) Program Curriculum, Volume 3, page 197
A vertical common-size income statement expresses each category of the income
statement as a PErcentage of revenue. The common-size format standardizes the
income statement by eliminating the effects of size. This allows for comparison of
income statement items over time (time-series analysis) and across firms (crossSECtional analysis). For example, the following are year-end income statements of
industry comPEtitors North Company and South Company:
North Co.
South Co.
Revenue
$75,000,000
$3,500,000
Cost of goods sold
52,500,000
700,000
Gross profit
$22,500,000
$2,800,000
Administrative exPEnse
11,250,000
525,000
Research exPEnse
3,750,000
700,000
OPErating profit
$7,500,000
$1,575,000
Notice that North is significantly larger and more profitable than South when
measured in ABSolute dollars. North's gross profit is $22,500,000, as compared to
South's gross profit of $2,800,000. Similarly, North's oPErating profit of $7,500,000 is
significantly greater than South's oPErating profit of $1,575,000.
Once we convert the income statements to common-size format, we can see that
South is the more profitable firm on a relative basis. South's gross profit of 80% and
oPErating profit of 45% are significantly greater than North's gross profit of 30% and
oPErating profit of 10%.
North Co.
South Co.
Revenue
100%

Cost of goods sold
Gross profit

Administrative exPEnse

Research exPEnse
5%
OPErating profit
10%
20%
80%
15%
20%
45%
Common-size analysis can also be used to examine a firm's strategy. South's higher
gross profit margin may be the result of technologically suPErior products. Notice that
South sPEnds more on research than North on a relative basis. This may allow South to
charge a higher price for its products.
In most cases, expressing exPEnses as a PErcentage of revenue is appropriate. One
exception is income tax exPEnse. Tax exPEnse is more meaningful when expressed as a
PErcentage of pretax income. The result is known as the effective tax rate.
LOS 24.k: Evaluate a company's financial PErformance using common-size income
statements and financial ratios based on the income statement.
CFA(r) Program Curriculum, Volume 3, page 197
Margin ratios can be used to measure a firm's profitability quickly. Gross profit margin
is the ratio of gross profit (revenue minus cost of goods sold) to revenue (sales).
Gross profit margin can be increased by raising prices or reducing production costs. A
firm might be able to increase prices if its products can be differentiated from other
firms' products as a result of factors such as brand names, quality, technology, or
patent protection. This was illustrated in the previous example whereby South's gross
profit margin was higher than North's.
Another popular margin ratio is net profit margin. Net profit margin is the ratio of net
income to revenue.
Net profit margin measures the profit generated after considering all exPEnses. Like
gross profit margin, net profit margin should be compared over time and with the
firm's industry PEers.
Any subtotal found in the income statement can be expressed as a PErcentage of
revenue. For example, oPErating profit divided by revenue is known as oPErating
profit margin. Pretax accounting profit divided by revenue is known as pretax margin.
LOS 24.l: Describe, calculate, and interpret comprehensive income.
LOS 24.m: Describe other comprehensive income and identiFY major tyPEs of items
included in it.
CFA(r) Program Curriculum, Volume 3, page 201
At the end of each accounting PEriod, the net income of the firm is added to
stockholders' equity through an account known as retained earnings. Therefore, any
transaction that affects the income statement (net income) will also affect
stockholders' equity.
Recall that net income is equal to revenue minus exPEnses. Comprehensive income is
a more inclusive measure that includes all changes in equity except for owner
contributions and distributions. That is, comprehensive income is the sum of net
income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income includes
transactions that are not included in net income, such as:
1. Foreign currency translation gains and losses.
2. Adjustments for minimum PEnsion liability.
3. Unrealized gains and losses from cash flow hedging derivatives.
4. Unrealized gains and losses from available-for-sale SECurities.
Available-for-sale SECurities are investment SECurities that are not exPEcted to be held
to maturity or sold in the near term. Available-for-sale SECurities are reported on the
balance sheet at fair value. The unrealized gains and losses (the changes in fair value
before the SECurities are sold) are not reported in the income statement but are
reported directly in stockholders' equity as a component of other comprehensive
income.
Effective in 2018, IFRS treatment of financial instruments will no longer include the
available-for-sale classification. However, firms will still be able to choose, at the time
of purchase, to treat an equity SECurities investment as "financial assets measured at
fair value through other comprehensive income."
Under IFRS, firms can choose to report certain long-lived assets at fair value rather
than historical cost. In this case, the changes in fair value are also included in other
comprehensive income.
Example: Calculating comprehensive income
Calculate comprehensive income for Triple C Corporation using the selected financial statement data
found in the following table.
Answer:
The dividends received for available-for-sale SECurities and the realized gain on the sale of land are already
included in net income. Dividends paid and the reacquisition of common stock are transactions with
shareholders, so they are not included in comprehensive income.
Because firms have some flexibility of including or excluding transactions from net
income, analysts must examine comprehensive income when comparing financial
PErformance with other firms.

KEY CONCEPTS
LOS 24.a
The income statement shows an entity's revenues, exPEnses, gains and losses during a
reporting PEriod.
A multi-step income statement provides a subtotal for gross profit and a single step
income statement does not. ExPEnses on the income statement can be grouPEd by the
nature of the exPEnse items or by their function, such as with exPEnses grouPEd into
cost of goods sold.
LOS 24.b
Revenue is recognized when earned and exPEnses are recognized when incurred.
Methods for accounting for long-term contracts include:
PErcentage-of-completion--recognizes revenue in proportion to costs incurred.
Completed-contract--recognizes revenue only when the contract is complete.
Revenue recognition methods for installment sales are:
Normal revenue recognition at time of sale if collectibility is reasonably assured.
Installment sales method if collectibility cannot be reasonably estimated.
Cost recovery method if collectibility is highly uncertain.
Revenue from barter transactions can only be recognized if its fair value can be
estimated from historical data on similar non-barter transactions.
Gross revenue reporting shows sales and cost of goods sold, while net revenue
reporting shows only the difference between sales and cost of goods sold and should
be used when the firm is acting essentially as a selling agent and does not stock
inventory, take credit risk, or have control over supplier and price.
LOS 24.c
A firm using a revenue recognition method that is aggressive will inflate current PEriod
earnings at a minimum and PErhaps inflate overall earnings. Because of the estimates
involved, the PErcentage-of-completion method is more aggressive than the
completed-contract method. Also, the installment method is more aggressive than the
cost recovery method.
LOS 24.d
Converged accounting standards issued in May 2014 take a principles-based appROAch
to revenue recognition. These standards identiFY a five-step process for recognizing
revenue:
1. IdentiFY the contract(s) with a customer.
2. IdentiFY the PErformance obligations in the contract.
3. Determine the transaction price.
4. Allocate the transaction price to the PErformance obligations in the contract.
5. Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a PErformance obligation.
LOS 24.e
The matching principle requires that firms match revenues recognized in a PEriod with
the exPEnses required to generate them. One application of the matching principle is
seen in accounting for inventory, with cost of goods sold as the cost of units sold from
inventory that are included in current-PEriod revenue. Other costs, such as
depreciation of fixed assets or administrative overhead, are PEriod costs and are taken
without regard to revenues generated during the PEriod.
Depreciation methods:
Straight-line: Equal amount of depreciation exPEnse in each year of the asset's
useful life.
Declining balance: Apply a constant rate of depreciation to the declining book
value until book value equals residual value.
Inventory valuation methods:
FIFO: Inventory reflects cost of most recent purchases, COGS reflects cost of
oldest purchases.
LIFO: COGS reflects cost of most recent purchases, inventory reflects cost of
oldest purchases.
Average cost: Unit cost equals cost of goods available for sale divided by total
units available and is used for both COGS and inventory.
SPEcific identification: Each item in inventory is identified and its historical cost
is used for calculating COGS when the item is sold.
Intangible assets with limited lives should be amortized using a method that reflects
the flow over time of their economic benefits. Intangible assets with indefinite lives
(e.g., goodwill) are not amortized.
Users of financial data should analyze the reasons for any changes in estimates of
exPEnses and compare these estimates with those of PEer companies.
LOS 24.f
Results of discontinued oPErations are reported below income from continuing
oPErations, net of tax, from the date the decision to dispose of the oPErations is made.
These results are segregated because they likely are non-recurring and do not affect
future net income.
Unusual or infrequent items are reported before tax and above income from
continuing oPErations. An analyst should determine how "unusual" or "infrequent"
these items really are for the company when estimating future earnings or firm value.
Changes in accounting standards, changes in accounting methods applied, and
corrections of accounting errors require retrosPEctive restatement of all prior-PEriod
financial statements included in the current statement. A change in an accounting
estimate, however, is applied prosPEctively (to subsequent PEriods) with no
restatement of prior-PEriod results.
LOS 24.g
OPErating income is generated from the firm's normal business oPErations. For a
nonfinancial firm, income that results from investing or financing transactions is
classified as non-oPErating income, while it is oPErating income for a financial firm
since its business oPErations include investing in and financing SECurities.
LOS 24.h
When a company has potentially dilutive SECurities, it must report diluted EPS.
For any convertible preferred stock, convertible debt, warrants, or stock options that
are dilutive, the calculation of diluted EPS is:
LOS 24.i
A dilutive SECurity is one that, if converted to its common stock equivalent, would
decrease EPS. An antidilutive SECurity is one that would not reduce EPS if converted to
its common stock equivalent.
LOS 24.j
A vertical common-size income statement expresses each item as a PErcentage of
revenue. The common-size format standardizes the income statement by eliminating
the effects of size. Common-size income statements are useful for trend analysis and
for comparisons with PEer firms.
LOS 24.k
Common-size income statements are useful in examining a firm's business strategies.
Two popular profitability ratios are gross profit margin (gross profit / revenue) and net
profit margin (net income / revenue). A firm can often achieve higher profit margins by
differentiating its products from the comPEtition.
LOS 24.l
Comprehensive income is the sum of net income and other comprehensive income. It
measures all changes to equity other than those from transactions with shareholders.
LOS 24.m
Transactions with shareholders, such as dividends paid and shares issued or
repurchased, are not reported on the income statement.
Other comprehensive income includes other transactions that affect equity but do not
affect net income, including:
Gains and losses from foreign currency translation.
PEnsion obligation adjustments.
Unrealized gains and losses from cash flow hedging derivatives.
Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale SECurities.

1. For a nonfinancial firm, are depreciation exPEnse and interest exPEnse
included or excluded from oPErating exPEnses in the income statement?
Depreciation exPEnse
A. Included
B. Included
C. Excluded
Interest exPEnse
Included
Excluded
Included
Depreciation is included in the computation of oPErating exPEnses. Interest
exPEnse is a financing cost. Thus, it is excluded from oPErating exPEnses.
2. Are income taxes and cost of goods sold examples of exPEnses classified by
nature or classified by function in the income statement?
Income taxes
A. Nature
B. Function
Cost of goods sold
Function
Nature
C. Function
Function
Income taxes are exPEnses grouPEd together by their nature. Cost of goods
sold includes a number of exPEnses related to the same function, the
production of inventory.
3. Which of the following is least likely a condition necessary for revenue
recognition?
A. Cash has been collected.
B. The goods have been delivered.
C. The price has been determined.
In order to recognize revenue, the seller must know the sales price and be
reasonably sure of collection, and must have delivered the goods or rendered
the service. Actual collection of cash is not required.
4. AAA has a contract to build a building for $100,000 with an estimated time to
completion of three years. A reliable cost estimate for the project is $60,000. In
the fIRSt year of the project, AAA incurred costs totaling $24,000. How much
profit should AAA report at the end of the fIRSt year under the PErcentage-ofcompletion method and the completed-contract method?
PErcentage-of-completion
A. $16,000
B. $16,000
C. $40,000
Completed-contract
$0
$40,000
$0
$24,000 / $60,000 = 40% of the project completed. 40% of $100,000 = $40,000
revenue. $40,000 revenue - $24,000 cost = $16,000 profit for the PEriod. No
profit would be reported in the fIRSt year using the completed contract
method.
5. Which principle requires that cost of goods sold be recognized in the same
PEriod in which the sale of the related inventory is recorded?
A. Going concern.
B. Certainty.
C. Matching.
The matching principle requires that the exPEnses incurred to generate the
revenue be recognized in the same accounting PEriod as the revenue.
6. Which of the following would least likely increase pretax income?
A. Decreasing the bad debt exPEnse estimate.
B. Increasing the useful life of an intangible asset.
C. Decreasing the residual value of a depreciable tangible asset.
Decreasing the residual (salvage) value of a depreciable long-lived asset will
result in higher depreciation exPEnse and, thus, lower pretax income.
7. According to converged accounting standards issued in May 2014, the fIRSt step
in the revenue recognition process is to:
A. determine the price.
B. identiFY the contract.
C. identiFY the obligations.
The five stEPS in revenue recognition under the converged standards are:
1. IdentiFY the contract or contracts with the customer.
2. IdentiFY the PErformance obligations in the contract(s).
3. Determine a transaction price.
4. Allocate the transaction price to the PErformance obligations.
5. Recognize revenue when/as the PErformance obligations have been
satisfied.
8. When accounting for inventory, are the fIRSt-in, fIRSt-out (FIFO) and last-in, fIRStout (LIFO) cost flow assumptions PErmitted under U.S. GAAP?
FIFO
A. Yes
B. Yes
C. No
LIFO
Yes
No
Yes
LIFO and FIFO are both PErmitted under U.S. GAAP. LIFO is prohibited under
IFRS.
9. Which of the following best describes the impact of depreciating equipment
with a useful life of 6 years using the declining balance method as compared to
the straight-line method?
A. Total depreciation exPEnse will be higher over the life of the equipment.
B. Depreciation exPEnse will be higher in the fIRSt year.
C. ScraPPIng the equipment after five years will result in a larger loss.
Accelerated depreciation will result in higher depreciation in the early years
and lower depreciation in the later years compared to the straight-line
method. Total depreciation exPEnse will be the same under both methods. The
book value would be higher in the later years using straight-line depreciation,
so the loss from scraPPIng the equipment under an accelerated method is less
compared to the straight-line method.
10. CC Corporation reported the following inventory transactions (in chronological
order) for the year:
Purchase
Sales
40 units at $30
13 units at $35
20 units at $40
35 units at $45
90 units at $50
60 units at $60
Assuming inventory at the beginning of the year was zero, calculate the yearend inventory using FIFO and LIFO.
FIFO
A. $5,220
B. $2,100
C. $2,100
LIFO
$1,040
$1,280
$1,040
108 units were sold (13 + 35 + 60) and 150 units were available for sale
(beginning inventory of 0 plus purchases of 40 + 20 + 90), so there are 150 -
108 = 42 units in ending inventory. Under FIFO, units from the last batch
purchased would remain in inventory: 42 x $50 = $2,100. Under LIFO, the fIRSt
42 units purchased would be in inventory: (40 x $30) + (2 x $40) = $1,280.
11. At the beginning of the year, Triple W Corporation purchased a new piece of
equipment to be used in its manufacturing oPEration. The cost of the
equipment was $25,000. The equipment is exPEcted to be used for 4 years and
then sold for $4,000. Depreciation exPEnse to be reported for the SECond year
using the double-declining-balance method is closest to:
A. $5,250.
B. $6,250.
C. $7,000.
Year 1: (2 / 4) x 25,000 = $12,500. Year 2: (2 / 4) x (25,000 - 12,500) = $6,250.
12. Which of the following is least likely considered a nonoPErating transaction
from the PErsPEctive of a manufacturing firm?
A. Dividends received from available-for-sale SECurities.
B. Interest exPEnse on subordinated debentures.
C. Accruing bad debt exPEnse for goods sold on credit.
Bad debt exPEnse is an oPErating exPEnse. The other choices are nonoPErating
items from the PErsPEctive of a manufacturing firm.
13. Changing an accounting estimate:
A. is reported prosPEctively.
B. requires restatement of all prior-PEriod statements presented in the
current financial statements.
C. is reported by adjusting the beginning balance of retained earnings for
the cumulative effect of the change.
A change in an accounting estimate is reported prosPEctively. No restatement
of prior PEriod statements is necessary.
14. Which of the following transactions would most likely be reported below
income from continuing oPErations, net of tax?
A. Gain or loss from the sale of equipment used in a firm's manufacturing
oPEration.
B. A change from the accelerated method of depreciation to the straightline method.
C. The oPErating income of a physically and oPErationally distinct division
that is currently for sale, but not yet sold.
A physically and oPErationally distinct division that is currently for sale is
treated as a discontinued oPEration. The income from the division is reported
net of tax below income from continuing oPErations. Changing a depreciation
method is a change of accounting principle, which is applied retrosPEctively
and will change oPErating income.
15. Which of the following statements about nonrecurring items is least accurate?
A. Discontinued oPErations are reported net of taxes at the bottom of the
income statement before net income.
B. Unusual or infrequent items are reported before taxes above net income
from continuing oPErations.
C. A change in accounting principle is reported in the income statement
net of taxes after extraordinary items and before net income.
A change in accounting principle requires retrosPEctive application; that is, all
prior PEriod financial statements currently presented are restated to reflect the
change.
16. The Hall Corporation had 100,000 shares of common stock outstanding at the
beginning of the year. Hall issued 30,000 shares of common stock on May 1. On
July 1, the company issued a 10% stock dividend. On September 1, Hall issued
1,000, 10% bonds, each convertible into 21 shares of common stock. What is
the weighted average number of shares to be used in computing basic and
diluted EPS, assuming the convertible bonds are dilutive?
Average shares, basic
A. 132,000
B. 132,000
C. 139,000
Average shares, dilutive
139,000
146,000
146,000
The new stock is weighted by 8 / 12. The bonds are weighted by 4 / 12 and are
not affected by the stock dividend.
Basic shares = {[100,000 x (12 / 12)] + [30,000 x (8 / 12)]} x 1.10 = 132,000
Diluted shares = 132,000 + [21,000 x (4 / 12)] = 139,000
17. Given the following information, how many shares should be used in
computing diluted EPS?
300,000 shares outstanding.
100,000 warrants exercisable at $50 PEr share.
Average share price is $55.
Year-end share price is $60.
A. 9,091.
B. 90,909.
C. 309,091.
Since the exercise price of the warrants is less than the average share price, the
warrants are dilutive. Using the treasury stock method to determine the
denominator impact:
Thus, the denominator will increase by 9,091 shares to 309,091 shares. The
question asks for the total, not just the impact of the warrants.
18. An analyst gathered the following information about a company:
100,000 common shares outstanding from the beginning of the year.
Earnings of $125,000.
1,000, 7%, $1,000 par bonds convertible into 25 shares each, outstanding
as of the beginning of the year.
The tax rate is 40%.
The company's diluted EPS is closest to:
A. $1.22.
B. $1.25.
C. $1.34.
FIRSt, calculate basic EPS =
Next, check if the convertible bonds are dilutive:
numerator impact = (1,000 x 1,000 x 0.07) x (1 - 0.4) = $42,000
denominator impact = (1,000 x 25) = 25,000 shares
Since $1.68 is greater than the basic EPS of $1.25, the bonds are antidilutive.
Thus, diluted EPS = basic EPS = $1.25.
19. An analyst has gathered the following information about a company:
50,000 common shares outstanding from the beginning of the year.
Warrants outstanding all year on 50,000 shares, exercisable at $20 PEr
share.
Stock is selling at year end for $25.
The average price of the company's stock for the year was $15.
How many shares should be used in calculating the company's diluted EPS?
A. 16,667.
B. 50,000.
C. 66,667.
The warrants in this case are antidilutive. The average price PEr share of $15 is
less than the exercise price of $20. The year-end price PEr share is not relevant.
The denominator consists of only the common stock for basic EPS.
20. Which of the following transactions affects owners' equity but does not affect
net income?
A. Foreign currency translation gain.
B. Repaying the face amount on a bond issued at par.
C. Dividends received from available-for-sale SECurities.
A foreign currency translation gain is not included in net income but the gain
increases owners' equity. Dividends received are reported in the income
statement. The repayment of principal does not affect owners' equity.
21. Which of the following is least likely to be included when calculating
comprehensive income?
A. Unrealized loss from cash flow hedging derivatives.
B. Unrealized gain from available-for-sale SECurities.
C. Dividends paid to common shareholders.
Comprehensive income includes all changes in equity except transactions with
shareholders. Therefore, dividends paid to common shareholders are not
included in comprehensive income.
22. A vertical common-size income statement expresses each category of the
income statement as a PErcentage of:
A. assets.
B. gross profit.
C. revenue.
Each category of the income statement is expressed as a PErcentage of
revenue (sales).
23. Which of the following would most likely result in higher gross profit margin,
assuming no fixed costs?
A. A 10% increase in the number of units sold.
B. A 5% decrease in production cost PEr unit.
C. A 7% decrease in administrative exPEnses.
A 5% decrease in PEr unit production cost will increase gross profit by lowering
cost of goods sold. Assuming no fixed costs, gross profit margin will remain the
same if sale quantities increase. Administrative exPEnses are not included in
gross profit margin.
