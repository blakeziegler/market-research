Amortization Expense Recognition
Amortization is the allocation of the cost of an intangible asset (e.g., franchise agreement) over its useful life. Amortization expense should match the proportion of the asset’s economic benefits used during the period. Most firms use the straight-line method to calculate annual amortization expense. Straight-line amortization is calculated the same way as straight-line depreciation. Intangible assets with indefinite lives (e.g., goodwill) are not amortized but must be tested for impairment annually. If impaired, an expense equal to the impairment amount is recognized.
Bad Debt Expense and Warranty Expense Recognition
If a firm sells goods or services on credit or provides a warranty, the matching principle requires estimating bad debt and/or warranty expense in the same period as the sale. This avoids delaying expense recognition.
Implications for Financial Analysis
Expense recognition involves estimation. Firms may delay or accelerate expense recognition. Delaying expenses inflates current net income and is more aggressive. Analysts should question changes in expense estimates: is a lower bad debt expense due to better collections or income manipulation? Analysts should compare a firm’s estimates to peers. If warranty expense is significantly lower, is it due to better quality or aggressive accounting? Accounting policies and estimates are disclosed in financial statement footnotes and the MD&A section.
Non-Recurring Items
Discontinued Operations
A discontinued operation is one management has decided to dispose of, whether sold in the current year or still pending. It must be physically and operationally distinct. The measurement date is when the disposal plan is formalized. The time until disposal is the phaseout period. Income or loss from discontinued operations is reported net of tax after income from continuing operations. Prior income statements are restated to separate discontinued operations. Estimated losses during the phaseout and losses on sale are accrued. Gains on disposal are recognized only after the sale is complete. Analysts exclude discontinued operations when forecasting earnings. The event may still indicate future cash flow implications.
Unusual or Infrequent Items
These events are either unusual in nature or infrequent in occurrence. Examples:
	•	Gains or losses from the sale of assets or business units outside normal operations
	•	Impairments, write-offs, and restructuring costs
These items are included in income from continuing operations and reported pre-tax. Analysts should review them carefully. Some firms report “unusual” items frequently.
Extraordinary Items
U.S. GAAP historically allowed extraordinary items that were both unusual and infrequent. They were reported net of tax after continuing operations. After December 15, 2015, U.S. GAAP no longer allows extraordinary item treatment. IFRS never allowed it.
Changes in Accounting Policies
Changes include principles, estimates, and prior-period adjustments.
A change in principle is a shift from one GAAP or IFRS method to another (e.g., LIFO to FIFO). This requires retrospective application: all prior statements are restated for comparability.
Exception: Under U.S. GAAP, switching to LIFO is not applied retrospectively. The inventory’s carrying value becomes the first LIFO layer.
A change in estimate is due to new information (e.g., updating the useful life of an asset). This is applied prospectively—no restating of prior statements. Analysts should assess how estimate changes affect future results.
A correction of an error or shift from an incorrect method is a prior-period adjustment. These are made by restating all prior periods presented and disclosing the nature and income impact of the adjustment. Errors may signal internal control weaknesses.
LOS 24.g: Distinguish Operating vs. Non-Operating Income Statement Components
Operating and non-operating items are reported separately. For nonfinancial firms, non-operating items include investment income and financing expenses. Examples:
	•	Dividends and interest from investments in other firms
	•	Gains/losses on the sale of securities
	•	Interest expense, based on capital structure
These are not part of core operations. However, for financial firms, these are typically considered operating activities.
EPS: Basic vs. Diluted
Earnings per share (EPS) is a key measure of corporate profitability for publicly traded firms. Only common stock (ordinary shares) is included.
A simple capital structure has no dilutive securities—only common stock, nonconvertible debt, and nonconvertible preferred stock.
A complex capital structure includes dilutive instruments like options, warrants, or convertibles.
Firms with complex capital structures must report both basic and diluted EPS. Simple structures require only basic EPS.
BASIC EPS
The basic EPS calculation does not consider the effects of any dilutive securities in computing EPS. The current year’s preferred dividends are subtracted from net income because EPS reflects per-share earnings available to common shareholders. Net income minus preferred dividends gives income available to common shareholders. Common stock dividends are not subtracted since they are already part of net income available to common shareholders.
The weighted average number of common shares is calculated by weighting the shares outstanding by the portion of the year they were outstanding.
Example: Weighted average shares and basic EPS
Johnson Company has net income of $10,000, paid $1,000 in preferred dividends, and $1,750 in common dividends. It started the year with 10,000 common shares and issued 2,000 new shares on July 1.
Shares outstanding all year = 10,000 × 12 = 120,000
Shares for half a year = 2,000 × 6 = 12,000
Weighted average = 132,000 ÷ 12 = 11,000 shares
Basic EPS = ($10,000 – $1,000) ÷ 11,000 = $0.818

Effect of Stock Dividends and Splits
A stock dividend is the issuance of additional shares in proportion to current holdings. A 10% stock dividend grants 10 new shares for every 100 owned.
A stock split divides each share into multiple shares. A 2-for-1 split doubles shares; a 3-for-2 split increases shares by 50%.
These actions do not affect ownership proportion; only the number of shares changes. For example, a 50% dividend and a 3-for-2 split are functionally equivalent.
For EPS, stock dividends or splits require adjusting all pre-event share quantities. Post-event issuances or repurchases are not affected.
Example: Effect of Stock Dividend on EPS
R & J, Inc. had net income of $100,000, paid $50,000 in preferred dividends, and $30,000 in common dividends. A 10% stock dividend was issued during the year.
Step 1: Multiply all shares before the dividend by 1.1
Step 2: Compute weighted average shares
Step 3: Basic EPS = (Net income – preferred dividends) ÷ adjusted weighted average shares
Rules for Weighted Average Shares Calculation
	•	Use day-weighting or, for simplicity, months
	•	New shares are included from issue date
	•	Repurchased shares are excluded from reacquisition date
	•	Asset purchases involving stock are included from issue date
	•	Stock splits/dividends are applied to all prior shares and beginning-of-period weighted shares
	•	No adjustment for shares issued or repurchased after the split/dividend
DILUTED EPS
Diluted EPS accounts for potential dilution from securities like options, warrants, convertible debt, and convertible preferred stock.
Dilutive securities would reduce EPS if converted; antidilutive securities would increase EPS if converted.
For diluted EPS:
	•	If convertible preferred stock is dilutive, add preferred dividends back to net income
	•	If convertible bonds are dilutive, add back after-tax interest to net income
Interest × (1 – tax rate) is added because converting bonds removes interest expense but also removes the tax benefit
Professor’s Note: Bond interest is typically tax-deductible. Upon conversion to equity, the firm saves the interest expense but loses the tax deduction, so only the net after-tax interest is added to income available to common shareholders.
The basic EPS denominator is the weighted average number of shares. For diluted EPS, this denominator is adjusted by adding the number of common shares that would result from the conversion of all dilutive securities (convertible bonds, preferred shares, options, warrants), each evaluated individually to determine whether it is dilutive. If the security was issued during the year, the added shares are weighted accordingly.
Dilutive options or warrants increase the denominator but do not affect the numerator. They are dilutive only if their exercise price is less than the average market price during the year. Use the treasury stock method to calculate the adjustment.
The treasury stock method assumes the funds received from option exercises are used to repurchase stock at the average market price. The net increase in shares is:
shares issued on exercise – shares repurchased using proceeds

Example: Treasury Stock Method
Baxter Company has 5,000 shares all year and 2,000 warrants at $20 exercise price. Average stock price = $30.
Exercise yields $40,000 = 2,000 × $20
Shares repurchased = $40,000 ÷ $30 = 1,333
Net shares added = 2,000 – 1,333 = 667
The diluted EPS formula is:
Diluted EPS = (Net income – preferred dividends + convertible preferred dividends + after-tax interest on convertible debt) ÷ (Weighted average shares + new shares from conversion)

Example 1: EPS with Convertible Debt
20X6: ZZZ Corp. net income = $115,600; 200,000 common shares; 1,000 preferred shares at 10%, $100 par; 600 convertible bonds at $1,000, 7% interest; convertible to 100 shares each; tax rate = 40%

Step 1: Basic EPS = ($115,600 – $10,000) ÷ 200,000 = $0.53
Step 2: Add 60,000 shares from bond conversion (600 × 100)
Add back after-tax interest to numerator:
Interest = 600 × $1,000 × 7% = $42,000
After-tax interest = $42,000 × (1 – 0.40) = $25,200
Diluted EPS = ($115,600 – $10,000 + $25,200) ÷ (200,000 + 60,000) = $0.50
Since $0.50 < $0.53, bonds are dilutive

To check:
Interest after tax ÷ new shares = $25,200 ÷ 60,000 = $0.42
Since $0.42 < $0.53, conversion is dilutive

Example 2: EPS with Convertible Preferred Stock
20X6: ZZZ Corp. net income = $115,600; 200,000 common shares; 1,000 preferred shares, 10%, $100 par; each preferred share convertible to 40 common shares

Step 1: Basic EPS = ($115,600 – $10,000) ÷ 200,000 = $0.53
Step 2: Add back preferred dividends = $10,000
Add 40,000 shares from conversion (1,000 × 40)
Diluted EPS = ($115,600) ÷ (200,000 + 40,000) = $0.48
Since $0.48 < $0.53, conversion is dilutive and should be included.
If the convertible preferred shares were converted to common stock, there would be no preferred dividends paid. Therefore, add back the convertible preferred dividends that were subtracted from net income. Compute diluted EPS as if conversion occurred. If diluted EPS < basic EPS ($0.48 < $0.53), the preferred stock is dilutive and included. Otherwise, it’s antidilutive. A quick check is dividing preferred dividends by new shares from conversion. If the result < basic EPS, it’s dilutive.
Example 3: Stock Options
20X6: Net income = $115,600; 200,000 common shares; 1,000 preferred shares at 10%, $100 par; 10,000 stock options at $15 each; average stock price = $20.
Net increase in shares = [(AMP – EP) ÷ AMP] × N = [(20 – 15)/20] × 10,000 = 2,500 shares
Example 4: Convertible Bonds, Preferred, Options
Net income = $115,600; 200,000 shares; 1,000 preferred shares (10%, $100 par), convertible to 40 shares each; 600 bonds (7%, $1,000 par), convertible to 100 shares each; 10,000 stock options at $15 with $20 average price; tax rate = 40%.
Step 1: From prior examples, all instruments are dilutive. Basic EPS already known.
Step 2: Denominator increases:
Preferred shares = 1,000 × 40 = 40,000
Convertible bonds = 600 × 100 = 60,000
Options = 2,500
Total added shares = 102,500
Step 3: Numerator adjustments:
Add $10,000 preferred dividends
Bond interest = 600 × 1,000 × 0.07 = 42,000 × (1 – 0.4) = 25,200
Adjusted net income = 115,600 + 10,000 + 25,200 = 150,800
Diluted EPS = 150,800 ÷ 302,500 = ~$0.50
LOS 24.j: Common-Size Income Statements
A vertical common-size income statement expresses each line item as a % of revenue. This standardizes comparisons over time and across firms. Example:
North: Revenue $75M, COGS $52.5M, Gross Profit $22.5M, Op Profit $7.5M
South: Revenue $3.5M, COGS $0.7M, Gross Profit $2.8M, Op Profit $1.575M
In absolute terms North is larger. But as % of revenue:
North: Gross Margin 30%, Op Margin 10%
South: Gross Margin 80%, Op Margin 45%
South is relatively more profitable. South also spends more on research relative to revenue.
Tax expense should be shown as % of pretax income, giving the effective tax rate.
LOS 24.k: Profitability via Ratios
Gross Profit Margin = Gross Profit / Revenue
Higher margin may reflect pricing power or differentiation via brand, quality, tech, patents.
Net Profit Margin = Net Income / Revenue
Compare both ratios over time and to peers.
Any subtotal (e.g., op profit, pretax income) can be shown as % of revenue.
Net income flows into retained earnings, impacting equity. Comprehensive income includes all equity changes not from owner activity. It equals net income plus other comprehensive income (OCI). OCI includes:
	1.	FX translation gains/losses
	2.	Pension liability adjustments
	3.	Unrealized gains/losses on hedging instruments
	4.	Unrealized gains/losses on available-for-sale securities
AFS securities are not held for maturity or short-term sale. Reported at fair value. Unrealized changes not on income statement but in equity as OCI.
IFRS no longer allows AFS classification for equity securities after 2018, but firms may elect fair value through OCI.
IFRS also allows revaluation of long-lived assets, with changes reported in OCI.
Example: Triple C’s comprehensive income
Dividends received from AFS and gains on land sale are in net income. Dividends paid and treasury stock are shareholder transactions, excluded from comprehensive income.
Analysts must assess comprehensive income to detect firmwide performance changes obscured by net income-only views.
KEY CONCEPTS
LOS 24.a: Income Statement shows revenues, expenses, gains, losses. Multi-step includes gross profit; single-step does not. Expenses can be grouped by function or nature.
LOS 24.b: Revenue is recognized when earned; expenses when incurred.
Long-term contracts:
– Percentage-of-completion: recognize revenue based on cost incurred
– Completed-contract: recognize only when complete
Installment sales:
– Use normal method if collectibility assured
– Use installment method if collectibility uncertain
– Use cost recovery method if highly uncertain
Barter revenue is only recognized if fair value can be estimated from non-barter history.
Gross vs. Net revenue: gross shows full sales and COGS; net only the margin if firm acts as agent.
LOS 24.c: Aggressive revenue methods inflate earnings. Percentage-of-completion is more aggressive than completed-contract. Installment > cost recovery in aggressiveness.
LOS 24.d: 5-step model for revenue under converged standards:
	5.	Identify contract
	6.	Identify performance obligations
	7.	Determine transaction price
	8.	Allocate price
	9.	Recognize revenue when performance occurs
LOS 24.e: Matching principle matches revenues and expenses in same period.
Inventory cost flows:
– FIFO: Inventory is recent cost; COGS is oldest
– LIFO: COGS is recent cost; inventory is oldest
– Avg cost: COGS/inventory based on average
– Specific ID: track individual unit costs
Depreciation:
– Straight-line: same expense annually
– Declining balance: higher early, lower later
Intangibles with definite lives are amortized. Indefinite lives (e.g., goodwill) are not.
Changes in estimates should be compared with peers.
LOS 24.f:
Discontinued operations are shown net of tax, after income from continuing ops. Unusual/infrequent items are shown pre-tax above continuing ops.
Accounting standard/method changes require retrospective restatement. Estimate changes are applied prospectively.
LOS 24.g:
Operating income = normal business income. For financial firms, investment income is operating.
LOS 24.h:
Firms with potential dilution must report diluted EPS.
LOS 24.i:
Dilutive securities lower EPS if converted; antidilutive do not.
LOS 24.j:
Common-size statements express each line as % of revenue for trend and peer comparison.
LOS 24.k:
Gross and net profit margins reflect pricing power and cost efficiency.
LOS 24.l:
Comprehensive income = Net Income + OCI
LOS 24.m:
Transactions with owners (e.g., dividends, stock issuance) not on income statement. OCI includes equity impacts not in net income: FX translation, pensions, hedging, AFS securities.
Accelerated depreciation results in higher early-year expenses and lower later-year ones than straight-line. Total depreciation same under both. Straight-line results in higher book value later, leading to larger losses on disposal.
