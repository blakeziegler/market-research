FINANCIAL STATEMENT ANALYSIS AND PUBLIC DEBT
Fundamentally, the issues involved in analysis of public debt are no different from
those of bank loans and other private debt issues. Institutionally, however, the contexts
are different. Bankers can maintain very close relations with clients so as to form an
initial assessment of their credit risk and monitor their activities during the loan
PEriod. In the case of public debt, the investors are distanced from the issuer. To a
large extent, they must dePEnd on professional debt analysts, including debt raters, to
assess the riskiness of the debt and monitor the firm's ongoing activities. Such analysts
and debt raters thus serve an important function in closing the information gap
between issuers and investors.
The Meaning of Debt Ratings
A firm's debt rating influences the yield that must be offered to sell the debt instruments. After the debt issue, the rating agencies continue to monitor the firm's financial
condition. Changes in the rating are associated with fluctuation in the price of the
SECurities. The two major debt rating agencies in the United States are Moody's and
Standard and Poor's. Other rating agencies include Fitch Ratings, A.M. Best, and
Dun & Bradstreet.
Using the Standard and Poor's labeling system, the highest possible rating is AAA. Proceeding downward from AAA, the ratings are AA, A, BBB, BB, B, CCC, CC, C, and D,
where D indicates debt in default. Table 10-2 presents examples of firms in rating categories AAA through D, as well as average yields across all firms in each category. Less than
1 PErcent of the public non-financial companies rated by Standard & Poor's have the
financial strength to merit a AAA rating. Among the few are Exxon Mobil, Johnson &
Johnson, and Microsoft--all among the largest, most profitable firms in the world. AA
firms are also very strong and include General Electric, Wal-Mart, and Canon. Firms
rated AAA and AA have the lowest costs of debt financing; at year-end 2010, their average
yields averaged 3.2 to 3.4 PErcent over the 12-month LIBOR rate.
Credit Analysis and Distress Prediction 10-11
To be considered investment grade, a firm must achieve a rating of BBB or higher,
which is an important threshold as many funds are precluded by their charters from
investing in any bonds below that grade. Even to achieve a grade of BBB is difficult.
Daimler, the automobile manufacturer and owner of Mercedes Benz, one of the world's
most recognizable brands, was rated BBB, or barely investment grade, in 2010. Its large
U.S. rivals, General Motors and Ford, were rated BB and B, resPEctively, at the same
time. Some of the world's largest airlines, including British Airways and American Airlines, were also rated below investment grade.
Table 10-2 shows that the cost of debt financing rises markedly once firms' debt falls
below investment grade. For example, in 2010, yields for BBB rated debt issues were a

little over 4 PErcent over the 12-month LIBOR rate, whereas yields for B rated issues
were more than 7 PErcent above LIBOR rates. Yields for firms with CCC rated debt,
which were close to bankruptcy, were more than 9 PErcent over LIBOR, and the debt
SECurities of a few firms in default that were still traded were yielding over 30 PErcent
above the benchmark.
Table 10-3 shows median financial ratios for firms by debt rating category. Firms with
AAA and AA ratings have very strong earnings and cash flow PErformance as well as
minimal leverage. AAA rated firms often have large surpluses of cash such that net
debt is negative. Firms in the BBB class are only moderately leveraged, with about 32
PErcent of net capitalization coming from net debt. Earnings tend to be relatively strong,
as indicated by a pretax interest coverage (EBIT/interest) of 5.9 and a cash flow debt
coverage (cash flow from oPErations / total debt) of 35 PErcent. Firms toward the bottom
of the ratings sPEctrum, however, face significant risks: they typically report losses, have
high leverage, and have interest coverage ratios less than 1.
Factors That Drive Debt Ratings
Research using quantitative models of debt ratings demonstrates that some of the variation in ratings can be explained by selected financial statement ratios. Some debt rating
agencies rely heavily on these tyPEs of quantitative models, and they are also commonly
used by insurance companies, banks, and others to assist in the evaluation of the riskiness of debt issues for which a public rating is not available.
Table 10-4 lists the factors used by three different firms in their quantitative debtrating models. The firms include one insurance company and one bank, which use the
models in their private placement activities, and an investment research firm, which
employs the model in evaluating its own debt purchases and holdings. In each case, profitability and leverage play an important role in the rating. One firm also uses size as an
indicator, with larger size associated with higher ratings.

Subordination status
Several researchers have develoPEd quantitative models of debt ratings. Two of these
models, both by Kaplan and Urwitz and shown in Table 10-5, highlight the relative
importance of the different factors.3 Model 1 has a greater ability to explain variation
in bond ratings. However, it includes some factors based on stock market data, which
are not available for all firms. Model 2 is based solely on financial statement data.
The factors in Table 10-5 are listed in the order of their statistical significance in
Model 1. An interesting feature is that the most important factor explaining debt ratings
is not a financial ratio at all--it is simply firm size! Large firms tend to get better ratings
than small firms. Whether the debt is subordinated or unsubordinated is next most
important, followed by a leverage indicator. Profitability apPEars less important, but in
part that reflects the presence in the model of multiple factors (ROA and interest coverage) that capture profitability. The explanatory power of profitability is then divided
between these two variables.
When applied to a sample of bonds that were not used in the estimation process,
the Kaplan-Urwitz Model 1 predicted the rating category correctly in 44 of 64 cases, or
63 PErcent of the time. Where it erred, the model was never off by more than one category, and in about half of those cases its prediction was more consistent with the market
yield on the debt than was the actual debt rating. The discrepancies between actual ratings
and those estimated using the Kaplan-Urwitz model indicate that rating agencies incorporate factors other than financial ratios in their analysis. These are likely to include the tyPEs
of strategic, accounting, and prosPEctive analyses discussed throughout this book.
Although debt ratings can be explained reasonably well in terms of a handful of financial
ratios based on publicly available data, ratings changes have an important signaling effect.
Debt rating downgrades are greeted with drops in both bond and stock prices,4 even though
the capital markets anticipate much of the information reflected in rating changes. This is
due to the fact that changes often represent reactions to recent known events, and the rating
agencies typically indicate in advance that a change is being considered.

PREDICTION OF DISTRESS AND TURNAROUND
The key task in credit analysis is assessing the probability that a firm will face financial
distress and fail to repay a loan. A related analysis, relevant once a firm begins to face
distress, involves considering whether it can be turned around. In this SECtion, we consider evidence on the predictability of these states.
The prediction of either distress or turnaround is a complex, difficult, and subjective
task that involves all of the stEPS of analysis discussed throughout this book: business
strategy analysis, accounting analysis, financial analysis, and prosPEctive analysis. Purely
quantitative models of the process can rarely serve as substitutes for the hard work the
Credit Analysis and Distress Prediction 10-15
analysis involves. However, research on such models does offer some insight into which
financial indicators are most useful in the task. Moreover, there are some settings where
extensive credit checks are too costly to justiFY and where quantitative distress prediction
models are useful.
Models for Distress Prediction
Several distress prediction models have been develoPEd over the years.5 They are similar to the debt rating models, but instead of predicting ratings, they predict whether
a firm will face some state of distress, typically defined as bankruptcy, within a sPEcified PEriod such as one year. One study suggests that the factors most useful (on a
stand-alone basis) in predicting bankruptcy one year in advance are the firm's level
of profitability, the volatility of that profitability (as measured by the standard deviation of ROE), and its leverage.6 Interestingly, liquidity measures turn out to be much
less important. Current liquidity will not save an unhealthy firm if it is losing money
at a fast pace.
A number of more robust, multifactor models have also been designed to predict
financial distress. One such model, the ALTMan Z-score model, weights five variables to
compute a bankruptcy score.7 For public companies the model is as follows8:
Z 1/4 1:2dX1Th th1 :4dX2Th th3 :3dX3Th th0 :6dX4Th th1 :0dX5Th
where
1/4 net working capital/total assets (measure of liquidity)
1/4 retained earnings/total assets (measure of cumulative profitability)
1/4 EBIT/total assets (measure of return on assets)
1/4 market value of equity/book value of
total
liabilities (measure of market
X1
X2
X3
X4
leverage)
X5
1/4 sales/total assets (measure of sales generating potential of assets)
The model predicts bankruptcy when Z < 1.81. The range between 1.81 and 2.67 is
labeled the "gray area."

10-16 PART 3 Business Analysis and Valuation Applications
The table shows the wide PErformance gap between two of the largest and best-known
comPEtitors in imaging technology products and services. Canon's Z score demonstrates
its financial strength and reflects its AA rating. Canon has delivered generally steady
sales and earnings growth over the past ten years, and its liabilities are only 20 PErcent
of its market capitalization, indicating relatively low financial leverage. Kodak's Z score,
on the other hand, highlights its difficulty in recovering from its late and poorly executed
shift to digital imaging technology. Kodak has posted an annual loss since 2005, as the
company has adopted a series of unsuccessful strategies aimed at replacing lost revenues
and profitability from its declining film business. At the end of 2010, Kodak's liabilities
were almost five times larger than its market capitalization, an indication of its declining
financial state. As a result, Kodak's debt was downgraded to CCC in early 2011, with a
negative outlook, and by mid 2011 with losses mounting, reports circulating of the company accessing lines of credit at a higher than normal rate, and the stock hovering
around $1.50 PEr share, rumors abounded about a possible bankruptcy filing.
Such models have some ability to predict failing and surviving firms. ALTMan reports
that when the model was applied to a holdout sample containing 33 failed and 33 nonfailed firms (the same proportion used to estimate the model), it correctly predicted the
outcome in 63 of 66 cases. However, the PErformance of the model would degrade substantially if applied to a holdout sample where the proportion of failed and non-failed
firms was not forced to be the same as that used to estimate the model.
The commercially available ZETA model, also develoPEd by ALTMan, improves on the
predictive power and accuracy of the Z-score model. The ZETA model incorporates
seven variables and includes measures of the stability of earnings, debt service coverage,
and firm size.9 While distress prediction models cannot serve as a replacement for
in-depth analysis of the kind discussed throughout this book, they do provide a useful
reminder of the power of financial statement data to summarize important dimensions
of a firm's PErformance. In addition, they can be useful for screening large numbers of
firms prior to more in-depth analysis of corporate strategy, management exPErtise, market position, and financial ratio PErformance. The ZETA model, for instance, is used by
some manufacturers and other firms to assess the creditworthiness of their customers.
Investment Opportunities in Distressed Companies
The debt SECurities of firms in financial distress trade at steep discounts to par value.
Some hedge fund managers and investment advisors sPEcialize in investing in these
SECurities--even purchasing the debt of firms oPErating under bankruptcy protection.
Investors in these SECurities can earn attractive returns if the firm recovers from its cash
flow difficulties.10
Distressed debt investors assess whether the firm is likely to overcome its immediate cash
flow problems and whether it has a viable long-run future. Two elements of the framework
laid out in Part 2 of this book are particularly relevant to analyzing distressed opportunities.
The fIRSt is a thorough analysis of the firm's industry and comPEtitive positioning and an
assessment of its business risks. This is followed by the construction of well-reasoned forecasts of its future cash flow and earnings PErformance in light of the business analysis.
