Overview & Current Events
Philip Morris International is a tobacco company formed when its parent company Altria (MO) spun off its international operations. It sells cigarettes under the Marlboro brand and others outside the U.S., while Altria retains U.S. rights. With a market cap of $203.9B, Philip Morris remains a dominant player. On September 12th, 2024, the company raised its dividend by 3.8% to $1.35 per quarter. On October 22nd, 2024, it reported Q3 results for the period ending September 30th, 2024, with net revenues of $9.91B (up 8.4% YoY) and adjusted EPS of $1.91 (up 14.4% YoY, or 18.0% in constant currency).
Total shipment volumes rose 2.9%, including 2.9% growth in cigarettes, 8.9% in heated tobacco, and 22.2% in oral products, largely due to the Swedish Match acquisition. Management raised FY2024 guidance: GAAP EPS expected between $6.20–$6.26 (previously $5.89–$6.01), including $0.42/share amortization. Adjusted EPS target increased to $6.85–$6.91 (from $6.67–$6.79), implying 14.5% YoY growth and a new record versus FY2023’s $6.01.
All EPS figures are GAAP unless stated.

Initially expected to be the high-growth segment after the Altria spin-off, Philip Morris saw strong EPS growth through 2013, but profit stagnation followed. Even in 2019, EPS had not surpassed 2013 highs. Currency volatility remains a critical factor, with all revenues generated outside the U.S.
Weaker profits between 2018–2020 were partly due to heavy investment in iQOS/Heatsticks. Though expensive, the payoff is becoming evident, with iQOS/Iluma adoption boosting income and margins. EPS is projected to grow 5% annually from the $6.88 base. The Swedish Match acquisition has been EPS-accretive.

Valuation Analysis
Shares traded at high valuations from 2015 to 2017. A current P/E of 19.1 on adjusted EPS makes the stock overvalued by our estimate. Our fair P/E is 16.5 based on expected growth and a valuation discount tied to the industry’s controversial nature. Some institutional disinterest may reverse as growth recovers, but we remain cautious.

Safety, Quality, Competitive Advantage, & Recession Resiliency
Dividend payout has remained high, sometimes exceeding 100% of net profit. Yet, thanks to strong cash generation and low capex needs, the dividend remains well-covered. Philip Morris boasts strong branding (Marlboro), leadership in reduced-risk products (iQOS), and economies of scale. Regulation remains the main risk, though global diversification mitigates U.S.-centric policy threats.

Final Thoughts & Recommendation
Philip Morris started H2 2024 strong. Q3 earnings and revenue were solid, and management’s upward guidance signals confidence. Swedish Match and growing heated tobacco use are likely to drive EPS further. With a 4.1% dividend and expected 5% annual growth, total return potential stands at 5.9% annually. Rating: Hold.
