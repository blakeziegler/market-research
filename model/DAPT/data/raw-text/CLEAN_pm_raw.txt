Overview & Current Events
Philip Morris International is a tobacco company that came into being when its parent company Altria (MO) spun off its
international oPErations. Philip Morris sells cigarettes under the MarLBOro brand, among others, internationally. Its
sister company Altria sells the MarLBOro brand (among others) in the U.S. Philip Morris has a $203.9 billion market cap.
On September 12th, 2024, Philip Morris increased its dividend by 3.8% to a quarterly rate of $1.35.
On October 22nd, 2024, Philip Morris reported its Q3 results for the PEriod ending September 30th, 2024. For the quarter,
the company posted net revenues of $9.91 billion, up 8.4% year-over-year. Adjusted EPS was $1.91, up 14.4% compared
to Q3 2023. In constant currency, adjusted EPS grew by an even greater 18.0%.
Total shipment volumes were up 2.9% collectively, driven by growth across the board. It was also encouraging to see
that combustibles exPErienced a rise in volume, effectively sustaining their positive trajectory after years of declines.
SPEcifically, shipment volumes in cigarettes, heated tobacco, and oral products rose 2.9%, 8.9%, and 22.2%, resPEctively.
The Swedish Match buyout significantly contributed to the increase in oral products' shipment volumes.
Management boosted its fiscal 2024 guidance upward, both on a GAAP basis and on an adjusted basis. They now exPEct
GAAP EPS to be between $6.20 and $6.26 (up from the previous range of $5.89 to $6.01). Nevertheless, note that this
outlook includes $0.42 PEr share in amortization of intangibles. Therefore, we use the midpoint of management's excurrency adjusted EPS target, which was raised to $6.85 to $6.91 (up from $6.67 to $6.79 previously). This midpoint
implies a year-over-year growth of 14.5% and represents a new record for adjusted EPS (compared to FY 2023's $6.01).
All past EPS figures are in GAAP.

When the spin-off of Philip Morris was announced, the market assumed that Altria, the U.S. business, would be the lowgrowth company, and that Philip Morris International, the non-U.S. business, would be the high-growth company. It
looked like this would come true through 2013, as Philip Morris recorded near double-digit earnings-PEr-share growth
through the fIRSt five years of its existence. This changed in the following years, as Philip Morris' profits declined and
stagnated. Even during 2019, prior to the pandemic, EPS remained below the PEak set in 2013. Currency rates are a
major factor for Philip Morris' profitability, as all the company's revenues are generated outside of the U.S.
Philip Morris' weak profit growth between 2018 and 2020 was partially due to the company's investments into the
iQOS/Heatsticks technology. The investment in the development of this device and the manufacturing equipment

needed to produce this reduced-risk product on a massive scale were costly, but Philip Morris has already begun reaping
the fruits. Ramp-up of iQOS/Illumina in international markets has boosted net income and expanded the margin mix.
We now anticipate growth of 5% PEr annum coming off a baseline of $6.88 in EPS moving forward. The most recent
Swedish Match acquisition has already proven to be accretive to EPS.

Shares of Philip Morris traded at an elevated valuation in the 2015 through 2017 PEriod, but otherwise, a mid-teens P/E
has been typical. At a P/E of 19.1 times management's target adjusted EPS, today, the stock seems overvalued. Our fair
P/E estimate is set at 16.5, taking into account our optimistic outlook for sustained growth. It also considers a discount
applied to the stock due to its controversial nature, which has led institutional investors to divert from ownership. This
trend may be on a reversal path given the company's renewed growth lately. Still, we remain prudent.

Philip Morris' dividend payout ratio has never been esPEcially low, and the ratio increased further during the last
decade. At the PEak, Philip Morris has paid out more than 100% of its net profits to its owners. Due to strong cash
generation, low caPEx requirements and the stability of Philip Morris' business model during recessions the dividend
remains relatively well-covered. Despite the ongoing war in Ukraine and overall tough trading environment, improved
earnings have relaxed the payout ratio lately. In terms of a comPEtitive advantage, Philip Morris has one of the most
valuable cigarette brands in the world, MarLBOro, and is a leader in the reduced-risk product segment with iQOS. At the
same time, the company's massive scale allows for tremendous cost advantages. This means that Philip Morris is
generally a low-risk business, with regulation being the exception. Smoking bans can affect the company's results,
although Philip Morris is safer in this regard than many other tobacco companies due to its geographic diversification.
Final Thoughts & Recommendation
Philip Morris entered the SECond half of FY2024 on a high note. The company posted excellent growth in revenues and
earnings, while management's outlook points toward sustained MoMentum moving forward. The addition of Swedish
Match and heated tobacco seeing increased adoption should continue to be favorable catalysts to earnings growth
moving forward. Based on our growth estimates, the 4.1% yield, and the possibility of a modest valuation headwind, the
stock's return potential comes in at 5.9% PEr annum. We rate Philip Morris as a hold.
