XYZ Incorperated (XYZ Inc or the company) was incorporated in the State of New
York on June 16, 1911, as the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Co. (C-T-R), a consolidation of the
Computing Scale Co. of America, the Tabulating Machine Co. and The International Time Recording Co.
of New York. Since that time, XYZ Inc has focused on the intersection of business insight and
technological innovation, and its operations and aims have been international in nature. This was
signaled over 100 years ago, in 1924, when C-T-R changed its name to International Business Machines
Corporation. And it continues today—we create sustained value for clients by helping them leverage
the power of hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence (AI). Our hybrid cloud platform and AI
technology support clients’ digital transformations and helps them reimagine critical workflows, at
scale, and modernize applications to increase agility, drive innovation and create operational
efficiencies. Our offerings draw from leading XYZ Inc capabilities in software, consulting services
capability to deliver business outcomes, and deep incumbency in mission-critical infrastructure, all
bolstered by one of the world’s leading research organizations.

 Risks Related to Our Business 
Downturn in Economic Environment and Client Spending Budgets Could Impact the Company’s Business: If
overall demand for XYZ Inc’s products and solutions decreases, whether due to general economic
conditions, or a shift in client buying patterns, the company’s revenue and profit could be impacted.
Failure of Innovation Initiatives Could Impact the Long-Term Success of the Company: XYZ Inc has moved
into areas, including those that incorporate or utilize hybrid cloud, AI and generative AI, quantum
and other disruptive technologies, in which it can differentiate itself through responsible
innovation, by leveraging its investments in R&D and attracting a successful developer ecosystem. If
XYZ Inc is unable to continue its cutting-edge innovation in a highly competitive and rapidly evolving
environment or is unable to commercialize such innovations, expand and scale them with sufficient
speed and versatility or is unable to attract a successful developer ecosystem, the company could
fail in its ongoing efforts to maintain and increase its market share and its profit margins.
Damage to XYZ Inc’s Reputation Could Impact the Company’s Business: XYZ Inc has one of the strongest brand
names in the world, and its brand and overall reputation could be negatively impacted by many
factors, including if the company does not continue to be recognized for its industry leading
technology and solutions and as a hybrid cloud and AI leader. XYZ Inc’s reputation is potentially
susceptible to damage by events such as significant disputes with clients, product defects, internal
control deficiencies, delivery failures, cybersecurity incidents, government investigations or legal
proceedings or actions of current or former clients, directors, employees, competitors, vendors,
alliance partners or joint venture partners. If the
 3 
company’s brand image is tarnished by negative perceptions, its ability to attract and retain
customers, talent and ecosystem partners could be impacted.
Risks from Investing in Growth Opportunities Could Impact the Company’s Business: The company
continues to invest significantly in key strategic areas, including AI and generative AI, to drive
revenue growth and market share gains. Client adoption rates and viable economic models are less
certain in the high-value, highly competitive, and rapidly-growing segments. Additionally, emerging
business and delivery models may unfavorably impact demand and profitability for our other products
or services. If the company does not adequately and timely anticipate and respond to changes in
customer and market preferences, competitive actions, disruptive technologies, emerging business
models and ecosystems, the client demand for our products or services may decline or XYZ Inc’s costs may
increase.
XYZ Inc’s Intellectual Property Portfolio May Not Prevent Competitive Offerings, and XYZ Inc May Not Be Able
to Obtain Necessary Licenses: The company’s patents and other intellectual property may not prevent
competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative to the
company’s, nor can there be any assurance that the resources invested by the company to protect its
intellectual property will be sufficient or that the company’s intellectual property portfolio will
adequately deter misappropriation or improper use of the company’s technology. In addition, the
company may be the target of aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by third parties,
including non-practicing entities. Also, there can be no assurances that XYZ Inc will be able to obtain
from third parties the licenses it needs in the future. The company’s ability to protect its
intellectual property could also be impacted by a lack of effective legal protections as well as
changes to existing laws, legal principles and regulations governing intellectual property, including
the ownership and protection of patents.
Certain of the company’s offerings incorporate or utilize open source and other third-party software
licensed with limited or no warranties, indemnification, or other contractual protections for XYZ Inc.
Further, if open source code that XYZ Inc utilizes is no longer maintained, developed or enhanced by the
relevant community of independent open source software programmers, most of whom we do not employ, we
may be unable to develop new technologies, adequately enhance our existing technologies or meet
customer requirements for innovation, quality and price.
Risks to the Company from Acquisitions, Alliances and Divestitures Include Integration Challenges,
Failure to Achieve Objectives, the Assumption or Retention of Liabilities and Higher Debt Levels: The
company has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions, alliances and divestitures. Such
transactions present significant challenges and risks and there can be no assurances that the company
will manage such transactions successfully, that strategic objectives will be achieved or that
strategic opportunities will be available to the company on acceptable terms or at all. With respect
to acquisitions and alliances, the related risks include the company failing to achieve anticipated
revenue improvements and cost savings, the failure to retain key personnel or strategic relationships
of acquired companies, the assumption of liabilities related to litigation or other legal proceedings
involving the businesses in such transactions, and delays in obtaining, or the failure to obtain,
necessary governmental or regulatory approvals, as well as the failure to close planned transactions.
Such transactions may require the company to secure financing and any significant disruption or
turmoil in the capital markets could have an adverse effect on XYZ Inc’s ability to access the capital
markets at favorable terms. From time to time, the company divests or attempts to divest assets that
are no longer central to its strategic objectives. Any such transaction is subject to risks,
including risks related to the terms and timing of such divestitures, risks related to retained
liabilities not subject to the company’s control, and delays in obtaining, or failing to obtain,
necessary governmental or regulatory approvals, as well as the failure to close planned transactions.
The Company’s Financial Results for Particular Periods Are Difficult to Predict: XYZ Inc’s revenues and
profitability are affected by such factors as the introduction of new products and services, the
ability to compete effectively in increasingly competitive marketplaces, the length of the sales
cycles and the seasonality of technology purchases. In addition, certain of the company’s growth
areas involve new products, new customers, new and evolving competitors, and new markets, all of
which contribute to the difficulty of predicting the company’s financial results. The company’s
financial results may also be impacted by the structure of products and services contracts and the
nature of its customers’ businesses; for example, certain of the company’s services contracts with
commercial customers in regulated industries are subject to periodic review by regulators with
respect to controls and processes. Further, general economic conditions, including sudden shifts in
regional or global economic activity may impact the company’s financial results in any particular
period. As a result of the above-mentioned factors, the company’s financial results are difficult to
predict. Historically, the company has had lower revenue in the first quarter than in the immediately
preceding fourth quarter. In addition, the high volume of products typically ordered at the end of
each quarter, especially at the end of the fourth quarter, make financial results for a given period
difficult to predict.
 4 
Due to the Company’s Global Presence, Its Business and Operations Could Be Impacted by Local Legal,
Economic, Political, Health and Other Conditions: The company is a globally integrated entity, doing
business in over 175 countries worldwide and deriving about sixty percent of its revenues from sales
outside the United States. Changes in the laws or policies of the countries in which the company
operates, or inadequate development or enforcement of such laws or policies, could affect the
company’s business and the company’s overall results of operations. Further, the company may be
impacted directly or indirectly by the development and enforcement of laws and regulations in the
U.S. and globally that are specifically targeted at the technology industry. The company’s results of
operations also could be affected by economic and political changes in those countries and by
macroeconomic changes, including recessions, inflation, currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar
and non-U.S. currencies, capital controls, and adverse changes in trade relationships amongst those
countries. Further, as the company expands its customer base and the scope of its offerings, both
within the U.S. and globally, it may be impacted by additional regulatory or other risks, including,
compliance with U.S. and foreign data privacy requirements, outbound investment restrictions, AI and
cloud regulations, data localization requirements, labor relations laws, enforcement of IP protection
laws, laws relating to anti-corruption, anti-competition regulations, and import, export and trade
restrictions. Further, international trade disputes could create uncertainty. Tariffs and
international trade sanctions resulting from these disputes could affect the company’s ability to
move goods and services across borders, or could impose added costs to those activities. Measures
taken to date by the company to mitigate these impacts could be made less effective should trade
sanctions or tariffs change. In addition, any widespread outbreak of an illness, pandemic or other
local or global health issue, natural disasters, climate change impacts, or uncertain political
climates, international hostilities, or any terrorist activities, could adversely affect customer
demand, the company’s operations and supply chain, and its ability to source and deliver products and
services to its customers.
The Company May Not Meet Its Growth and Productivity Objectives: On an ongoing basis, XYZ Inc seeks to
drive greater agility, productivity, flexibility and cost savings by continuously transforming with
the use of automation, AI, agile processes and changes to the ways of working, while also enabling
the scaling of resources, offerings and investments through the company’s globally integrated model
across both emerging and more established markets. These various initiatives may not yield their
intended gains in speed, quality, productivity and enablement of rapid scaling, which may impact the
company’s competitiveness and its ability to meet its growth and productivity objectives.
Ineffective Internal Controls Could Impact the Company’s Business and Operating Results: The
company’s internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because
of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, failure or interruption of
information technology systems, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Even effective
internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair
presentation of financial statements. If the company fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal
controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if the company
experiences difficulties in their implementation, the company’s business and operating results could
be harmed and the company could fail to meet its financial reporting obligations.
The Company’s Use of Accounting Estimates Involves Judgment and Could Impact the Company’s Financial
Results: The application of accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP) requires the
company to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect
its reported financial condition. The company’s most critical accounting estimates are described in
the Management Discussion in XYZ Inc’s 2024 Annual Report to Stockholders, under “Critical Accounting
Estimates.” In addition, as discussed in note Q, “Commitments & Contingencies,” in XYZ Inc’s 2024 Annual
Report to Stockholders, the company makes certain estimates including decisions related to legal
proceedings and reserves. These estimates and assumptions involve the use of judgment. As a result,
actual financial results may differ.
The Company’s Goodwill or Amortizable Intangible Assets May Become Impaired: The company acquires
other companies, including the intangible assets of those companies. The company may not realize all
the economic benefit from those acquisitions, which could cause an impairment of goodwill or
intangible assets. If our goodwill or net intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to
record a charge to the Consolidated Income Statement.
The Company Depends on Skilled Employees and Could Be Impacted by a Shortage of Critical Skills: Much
of the future success of the company depends on the continued service, availability and integrity of
skilled employees, including technical, marketing and staff resources. Skilled and experienced
personnel in the areas where the company competes are in high demand, and competition for their
talents is intense. Changing demographics and labor work force trends may result in a shortage of or
insufficient knowledge and skills. In addition, as global opportunities and industry demand shifts,
realignment, training and scaling of skilled resources may not be sufficiently rapid or successful.
Further, many of XYZ Inc’s key employees receive a total compensation package that includes equity
awards. Any new regulations, volatility in the
 5 
stock market and other factors could diminish the company’s use or the value of the company’s equity
awards, putting the company at a competitive disadvantage.
The Company’s Business Could Be Impacted by Its Relationships with Critical Suppliers: XYZ Inc’s business
employs a wide variety of components (hardware and software), supplies, services and raw materials
from a substantial number of suppliers around the world. Certain of the company’s businesses rely on
a single or a limited number of suppliers, including for server processor technology for certain
semiconductors. Changes in the business condition (financial or otherwise) of these suppliers could
subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring products to market. Further, the
failure of the company’s suppliers to deliver components, supplies, services and raw materials in
sufficient quantities, in a timely or secure manner, and in compliance with all applicable laws and
regulations could adversely affect the company’s business. In addition, any defective components,
supplies or materials, or inadequate services received from suppliers could reduce the reliability of
the company’s products and services and harm the company’s reputation.
Product and Service Quality Issues Could Impact the Company’s Business and Operating Results: The
company has rigorous quality control standards and governance processes intended to prevent, detect
and correct errors, malfunctions and other defects in its products and services. If errors,
malfunctions, defects or disruptions in service are experienced by customers or in the company’s
operations there could be negative consequences that could impact customers’ business operations and
harm the company’s business’s operating results.
The Development and Use of AI and Generative AI, including the Company’s Increased Offerings and Use
of AI-based Technologies, Could Impact the Long-Term Success of the Company and its Reputation or
Give Rise to Legal or Regulatory Action: XYZ Inc is increasingly applying AI-based technologies,
including generative AI, to its services and products, to how it delivers offerings to XYZ Inc clients,
and to its own internal operations. Additionally, XYZ Inc is investing in and offering new products and
services associated with AI development, deployment and management. As stated more comprehensively
and in context of several risk factors throughout this Item 1A., this increasing mix and application
of AI-based technologies may impact XYZ Inc’s ongoing efforts to maintain and increase its market share
and its profit margins or harm XYZ Inc’s reputation if the company does not continue to be recognized as
an AI leader with strong governance processes. XYZ Inc’s drive for greater agility, productivity,
flexibility and cost savings by continuously transforming with the use of AI may not yield intended
gains in speed, quality, productivity and enablement of rapid scaling, which may impact the company’s
competitiveness. The evolving global AI regulatory environment, including the enactment of the EU AI
Act, may affect the company’s business and the company’s overall results of operations. Computer
hackers and others routinely attack the security of technology products, services, systems and
networks using a wide variety of methods, and the increased use of generative AI may introduce novel
methods of attack. In the event of such actions, the company, its customers and other third parties
could be exposed to liability, litigation, and regulatory or other government action, including
debarment, as well as the loss of existing or potential customers, damage to brand and reputation,
damage to XYZ Inc’s competitive position, and other financial loss.
The Company Could Be Impacted by Its Business with Government Clients: The company’s customers
include numerous governmental entities within and outside the U.S., including the U.S. Federal
Government and state and local entities. Some of the company’s agreements with these customers may be
subject to periodic funding approval. Funding reductions, delays or work stoppages could adversely
impact public sector demand for our products and services. Also, some agreements may contain
provisions allowing the customer to terminate without cause and providing for higher liability limits
for certain losses. In addition, the company could be suspended or debarred as a governmental
contractor and could incur civil and criminal fines and penalties, which could negatively impact the
company’s results of operations, financial results and reputation.
The Company’s Reliance on Third-Party Distribution Channels and Ecosystems Could Impact Its Business:
The company offers its products directly and through a variety of third-party distributors,
resellers, independent software vendors, independent service providers, and other ecosystem partners.
Changes in the business condition (financial or otherwise) of these ecosystem partners could subject
the company to losses and affect its ability to bring its products to market. As the company moves
into new areas, ecosystem partners may be unable to keep up with changes in technology and offerings,
and the company may be unable to recruit and enable appropriate partners to achieve anticipated
ecosystem growth objectives. In addition, the failure of ecosystem partners to comply with all
applicable laws and regulations may prevent the company from working with them and could subject the
company to losses and affect its ability to bring products to market.
 6 
Cybersecurity, Privacy, and AI Considerations Could Impact the Company’s Business: There are numerous
and evolving risks to cybersecurity and privacy, including risks originating from intentional acts of
individual and groups of criminal hackers, hacktivists, state-sponsored organizations, nation states
and competitors; from intentional and unintentional acts or omissions of customers, contractors,
business partners, vendors, employees and other third parties; and from errors in processes or
technologies, as well as the risks associated with an increase in the number of customers,
contractors, business partners, vendors, employees and other third parties working remotely. Computer
hackers and others routinely attack the security of technology products, services, systems and
networks, like those we offer, using a wide variety of methods, including ransomware or other
malicious software and attempts to exploit vulnerabilities in hardware, software, and infrastructure,
and the increased use of generative AI may introduce novel methods of attack. Attacks also include
social engineering and cyber extortion to induce customers, contractors, business partners, vendors,
employees and other third parties to disclose information, transfer funds, or unwittingly provide
access to systems or data. The company is at risk of security breaches not only of our own products,
services, systems and networks, but also those of customers, contractors, business partners, vendors,
employees and other third parties, particularly as all parties increasingly digitize their
operations. Cyber threats are increasing in number and sophistication, continually evolving,
including with the increased use of AI, making it difficult to anticipate and defend against such
threats and vulnerabilities that can persist undetected over extended periods of time.
The company’s products, services, systems and networks, including cloud-based systems and systems and
technologies that the company maintains on behalf of its customers, are used in critical company,
customer or third-party operations, and involve the storage, processing and transmission of sensitive
data, including valuable intellectual property, other proprietary or confidential data, regulated
data, and personal information of employees, customers and others. These products, services, systems
and networks are also used by customers in heavily regulated industries, including those in the
financial services, healthcare, critical infrastructure and government sectors.
As is common in our industry and for a company our size, we continue to face and prepare for
cybersecurity threats. While the company continues to monitor for, identify, investigate, respond to
and remediate a wide range of cybersecurity events, there have not been cybersecurity incidents or
vulnerabilities that have had a material adverse effect on the company, though there is no assurance
that there will not be cybersecurity incidents or vulnerabilities that will have a material adverse
effect in the future.
The company regularly addresses cybersecurity attacks and vulnerabilities. Cybersecurity attacks or
other security incidents, including industry-wide incidents such as MOVEit, have or could result in,
for example, one or more of the following: unauthorized access to, disclosure, modification, misuse,
loss, or destruction of company, customer, or other third-party data or systems; theft or import or
export of sensitive, regulated, or confidential data including personal information and intellectual
property, including key innovations in AI, quantum, or other disruptive technologies; the loss of
access to critical data or systems through ransomware, crypto mining, destructive attacks or other
means; and business delays, service or system disruptions or denials of service.
In the event of such actions, the company, its customers and other third parties could be exposed to
liability, litigation, and regulatory or other government action, including debarment, as well as the
loss of existing or potential customers, damage to brand and reputation, damage to our competitive
position, and other financial loss. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of responding
to cybersecurity incidents and implementing remediation measures could be significant. In the
company’s industry, security vulnerabilities are increasingly discovered, publicized and exploited
across a broad range of hardware, software or other infrastructure, including in our own products,
services, systems and networks, or third-party data and systems upon which we rely, elevating the
risk of attacks and the potential cost of response and remediation for the company and its customers.
In addition, the fast-paced, evolving, pervasive, and sophisticated nature of certain cyber threats
and vulnerabilities, as well as the scale and complexity of the business and infrastructure, make it
possible that certain threats or vulnerabilities will be undetected or unmitigated in time to prevent
or minimize the impact of an attack on the company or its customers.
Cybersecurity risk to the company and its customers also depends on factors such as the actions,
practices and investments of customers, contractors, business partners, vendors, the open source
community and other third parties, including, for example, providing and implementing patches to
address vulnerabilities. Cybersecurity attacks or other catastrophic events resulting in disruptions
to or failures in power, information technology, communication systems or other critical
infrastructure could result in interruptions or delays to company, customer, or other third-party
operations or services, financial loss, injury or death to persons or property, potential liability,
and damage to brand and reputation.
 7 
Although the company continuously takes significant steps to mitigate cybersecurity risk across a
range of functions, such measures can never eliminate the risk entirely or provide absolute security.
As a global enterprise, the regulatory environment with regard to cybersecurity, privacy, AI and data
protection issues is increasingly complex and will continue to impact the company’s business,
including through increased risk, increased costs, and expanded or otherwise altered compliance
obligations, including with respect to the increased regulatory activity around the security of
critical infrastructure, IoT devices, customer industries (e.g., financial services) and various
customer and government supply chain security programs. As the reliance on data grows for the company
and our clients, the potential impact of regulations on the company’s business, risks, and reputation
will grow accordingly. The enactment and expansion of cybersecurity, AI, data protection and privacy
laws, regulations and standards around the globe will continue to result in increased compliance
costs, including due to an increased focus on international data transfer mechanisms and data
location; increased cybersecurity requirements and reporting obligations; the lack of harmonization
of such laws and regulations; the increase in associated litigation and enforcement activity by
governments and private parties; the potential for damages, fines and penalties and debarment; and
the potential regulation of new and emerging technologies. Any additional costs and penalties
associated with increased compliance, enforcement, and risk reduction could make certain offerings
less profitable or increase the difficulty of bringing certain offerings to market or maintaining
certain offerings.
 Risks Related to Laws and Regulations 
The Company Could Incur Substantial Costs Related to Climate Change and Other Environmental Matters:
XYZ Inc, like other companies, is subject to potential climate-related risks and costs such as those
resulting from increased severe weather events, prolonged changes in temperature, new regulations
affecting hardware products and data centers, carbon taxes, and increased environmental disclosures
requested or required by clients, regulators and others. The company is also subject to various
federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the
environment or otherwise related to environmental protection, including the U.S. Superfund law. The
company could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal
sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, if it were to
violate or become liable under environmental laws and regulations. We do not expect climate change or
compliance with environmental laws and regulations focused on climate change to have a
disproportionate effect on the company or its financial position, results of operations and
competitive position.
Tax Matters Could Impact the Company’s Results of Operations and Financial Condition: The company is
subject to income taxes in both the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. XYZ Inc’s provision
for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors
including, but not limited to, income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with
lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates,
changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in tax laws,
regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof, which could adversely impact the
company’s results of operations and financial condition in future periods. The Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has issued model rules for a new global minimum tax.
Local country adoption of these rules may increase tax uncertainty and may adversely impact the
company’s income taxes. Furthermore, local country, state, provincial or municipal taxation may also
be subject to review and potential override by regional, federal, national or similar forms of
government. In addition, XYZ Inc is subject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by
the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities around the world. The
company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to
determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes
from these examinations will not have an adverse effect on the company’s provision for income taxes
and cash tax liability.
The Company Is Subject to Legal Proceedings and Investigatory Risks: As a company with a substantial
employee population and with clients in more than 175 countries, XYZ Inc is or may become involved as a
party and/or may be subject to a variety of claims, demands, suits, investigations, tax matters and
other proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of its business. The risks
associated with such legal proceedings are described in more detail in note Q, “Commitments &
Contingencies,” in XYZ Inc’s 2024 Annual Report to Stockholders. The company believes it has adopted
appropriate risk management and compliance programs. Legal and compliance risks, however, will
continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies, the outcome of which
cannot be predicted with certainty, may arise from time to time.

Risks Related to Financing and Capital Markets Activities
The Company’s Results of Operations and Financial Condition Could Be Negatively Impacted by Its U.S.
and non-U.S. Pension Plans: Adverse financial market conditions and volatility in the credit markets
may have an unfavorable impact on the value of the company’s pension trust assets and its future
estimated pension liabilities. As a result, the company’s financial results in any period could be
negatively impacted. In addition, in a period of an extended financial market downturn, the company
could be required to provide incremental pension plan funding with resulting liquidity risk which
could negatively impact the company’s financial flexibility. Further, the company’s results could be
negatively impacted by premiums for mandatory pension insolvency insurance coverage outside the
United States. Premium increases could be significant due to the level of insolvencies of unrelated
companies in the country at issue. XYZ Inc’s 2024 Annual Report to Stockholders includes information
about potential impacts from pension funding and the use of certain assumptions regarding pension
matters.
The Company Is Exposed to Currency and Financing Risks That Could Impact Its Revenue and Business:
The company derives a significant percentage of its revenues and costs from its affiliates operating
in local currency environments, and those results are affected by changes in the relative values of
non-U.S. currencies and the U.S. dollar, as well as sudden shifts in regional or global economic
activity. Further, inherent in the company’s financing business are risks related to the
concentration of credit, client creditworthiness, interest rate and currency fluctuations on the
associated debt and liabilities and the determination of residual values. The company employs a
number of strategies to manage these risks, including the use of derivative financial instruments,
which involve the risk of non-performance by the counterparty. In addition, there can be no assurance
that the company’s efforts to manage its currency and financing risks will be successful.
The Company’s Financial Performance Could Be Impacted by Changes in Market Liquidity Conditions and
by Customer Credit Risk on Receivables: The company’s financial performance is exposed to a wide
variety of industry sector dynamics worldwide, including sudden shifts in regional or global economic
activity. The company’s earnings and cash flows, as well as its access to funding, could be
negatively impacted by changes in market liquidity conditions. XYZ Inc’s 2024 Annual Report to
Stockholders includes information about the company’s liquidity position. The company’s client base
includes many enterprises worldwide, from small and medium businesses to the world’s largest
organizations and governments, with a significant portion of the company’s revenue coming from global
clients across many sectors. Most of the company’s sales are on an open credit basis, and the company
performs ongoing credit evaluations of its clients’ financial conditions. If the company becomes
aware of information related to the creditworthiness of a major customer, or if future actual default
rates on receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the company may have to
adjust its allowance for credit losses, which could affect the company’s consolidated net income in
the period the adjustments are made.
 Risks Related to Ownership of XYZ Inc Securities 
Risk Factors Related to XYZ Inc Securities: The company and its subsidiaries issue debt securities in the
worldwide capital markets from time to time, with a variety of different maturities and in different
currencies. The value of the company’s debt securities fluctuates based on many factors, including
the methods employed for calculating principal and interest, the maturity of the securities, the
aggregate principal amount of securities outstanding, the redemption features for the securities, the
level, direction and volatility of interest rates, changes in exchange rates, exchange controls,
governmental and stock exchange regulations and other factors over which the company has little or no
control. The company’s ability to pay interest and repay the principal for its debt securities is
dependent upon its ability to manage its business operations, as well as the other risks described
under this Item 1A. entitled “Risk Factors.” There can be no assurance that the company will be able
to manage any of these risks successfully.
The company also issues its common stock from time to time in connection with various compensation
plans, contributions to its pension plan and certain acquisitions. The market price of XYZ Inc common
stock is subject to significant volatility, due to other factors described under this Item 1A.
entitled “Risk Factors,” as well as economic and geopolitical conditions generally, trading volumes,
speculation by the press or investment community about the company’s financial condition, and other
factors, many of which are beyond the company’s control. Since the market price of XYZ Inc’s common stock
fluctuates significantly, stockholders may not be able to sell the company’s stock at attractive
prices.
In addition, changes by any rating agency to the company’s outlook or credit ratings can negatively
impact the value and liquidity of both the company’s debt and equity securities. The company does not
make a market in either its debt or equity securities and cannot provide any assurances with respect
to the liquidity or value of suchsecurities.

Risk Management and Strategy
Cybersecurity is a critical part of risk management at XYZ Inc and is integrated with the company’s
overall enterprise risk management framework.The Board of Directors and the Audit Committee of the
Board are responsible for overseeing management’s execution of cybersecurity risk management and for
assessing XYZ Inc’s approach to risk management. Senior management is responsible for assessing and
managing XYZ Inc’s exposure to cybersecurity risks on an ongoing basis.
From an enterprise perspective, we implement a multi-faceted risk management approach based on the
National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework. We have established policies
and procedures that provide the foundation upon which XYZ Inc’s infrastructure and data are managed. We
regularly assess and adjust our technical controls and methods to identify and mitigate emerging
cybersecurity risks. We use a layered approach with overlapping controls to defend against
cybersecurity attacks and threats on XYZ Inc networks, end-user devices, servers, applications, data, and
cloud solutions.
We draw heavily on our own commercial security solutions and services to manage and mitigate
cybersecurity risks. XYZ Inc maintains a Security Operations Center (“SOC”) that monitors for threats to
XYZ Inc’s networks and systems, utilizing threat intelligence provided by a range of sources, including
the XYZ Inc Security X-Force Exchange platform, which maintains one of the largest compilations of threat
intelligence in the world. We also rely on tools licensed from third party security vendors to
monitor and manage cybersecurity risks. We periodically engage third parties to supplement and review
our cybersecurity practices and provide relevant certifications.
We have a global incident response process, managed by XYZ Inc’s Computer Security Incident Response Team
(“CSIRT”), that relies primarily on internal expertise to respond to cybersecurity threats and
attacks. We utilize a combination of online training, educational tools, videos and other awareness
initiatives to foster a culture of security awareness and responsibility among our workforce,
including responsibility for reporting suspicious activity.
XYZ Inc has a third party supplier risk management program to oversee and identify risks from
cybersecurity threats associated with its use of third party service providers and vendors. Risks are
assessed and prioritized based, among other things, on the type of offering/engagement, supplier
assessments, threat intelligence, and industry practices.
As discussed in greater detail in Item 1A., "Risk Factors," the company faces numerous and evolving
cybersecurity threats, including risks originating from the increased use of AI, intentional acts of
individual and groups of criminal hackers, hacktivists, state-sponsored organizations, nation states
and competitors; from intentional and unintentional acts or omissions of customers, contractors,
business partners, vendors, employees and other third parties; and from errors in processes or
technologies, as well as the risks associated with the number of customers, contractors, business
partners, vendors, employees and other third parties working remotely. While the company continues to
monitor for, identify, investigate, respond to and remediate cybersecurity risks, including incidents
and vulnerabilities, there have not been any that have had a material adverse effect on the company,
though there is no assurance that there will not be cybersecurity risks that will have a material
adverse effect in the future.
Governance
XYZ Inc’s Enterprise & Technology Security (“E&TS”) organization has oversight responsibility for the
security of both XYZ Inc’s internal systems and external offerings and works across all of the
organizations within the company to protect XYZ Inc, its brand, and its clients against cybersecurity
risks. E&TS also addresses cybersecurity risks associated with third party suppliers. For these
purposes, E&TS includes a dedicated Chief Information Security Officer (“CISO”) whose team is
responsible for leading enterprise-wide information security strategy, policy, standards,
architecture, and processes for XYZ Inc’s internal systems. The CISO manages the CSIRT. The CISO also
manages the Product Security Incident Response Team (“PSIRT”), which focuses on product
vulnerabilities potentially affecting the security of offerings sold to customers. XYZ Inc also has
Business Information Security Officers (“BISO”) who are coordinated by the Office of the CISO on
security issues specific to particular business segments.
 10 
The CSIRT team, together with the Office of the Chief Information Officer (“CIO”), Cyber Legal,
Corporate Security, and BISOs, engages in on-going reviews of incidents, threat intelligence,
detections, and vulnerabilities, including to assess client and regulatory impact. Events of interest
are promptly reported to the Senior Vice President (“SVP”) and Chief Legal Officer ("CLO"), and the
SVP overseeing cybersecurity (“SVP Sponsor”).
Incidents are delegated to an appropriate incident response team for assessment, investigation, and
remediation. Depending on the nature of the matter, the incident response team may include
individuals from E&TS, the Office of the CISO, the Office of the CIO, Cyber Legal, Business Units,
the Office of Privacy and Responsible Technology, Human Resources, Procurement, Finance and
Operations, and Corporate Security. The incident response teams advise and consult with the CLO and
the SVP Sponsor, as appropriate.
The Cybersecurity Advisory Committee (“CAC”)meets regularly and is responsible for overseeing
management of the Company’s cybersecurity risk. The CAC is composed of, among others, SVPs from the
major business units, the SVP Sponsor, and the CLO. The CAC is responsible for, among other things,
setting the Company’s governance structure for managing cybersecurity risk and reviewing noteworthy
cybersecurity incidents and strategies to prevent recurrence. XYZ Inc management responsible for managing
cybersecurity risk reflects a cross-section of functions from across the organization with
significant experience in managing such risk as well as the technologies underlying these risks. They
also hold leadership positions outside of XYZ Inc in the field of cybersecurity, serving on governing and
advisory boards of public and private institutions at the forefront of issues related to
cybersecurity, including technology development, cybersecurity policy, and national security.
The Board of Directors and the Audit Committee oversee the cyber governance process. Leadership from
E&TS, including the CISO, make regular presentations to the Audit Committee and the full Board on
identification, management, and remediation of cybersecurity risks, both internal and external, as
well as threat intelligence, emerging global policies and regulations, cybersecurity technologies,
and best practices.In addition, senior management provides briefings as needed to the Audit Committee
Chair, the Audit Committee, and, as appropriate, the full Board, on cybersecurity issues and
incidents of potential interest.
XYZ Inc ’s corporate headquarters are located at an owned site in Armonk, New York. As of December 31,
2024, in aggregate, we owned or leased facilities for current use consisting of approximat ely 41
million square feet worldwide.
At December 31, 2024, XYZ Inc’s facilities in the U.S. had aggregate floor space of approximately 17
million square feet, of which approximately 9 million was owned and 8 million was leased. Outside the
U.S., facilities totaled approximately 24 million square feet, of which 3 million was owned and 21
million was leased. This space is primarily used for sales and distribution, manufacturing and
development, data processing services including the company’s cloud centers, research and other
administrative and general support purposes. Our facilities are utilized for current operations of
all business segments.
Continuous optimization, maintenance and upgrading of facilities are essential to maintain our
technological leadership, improve productivity and meet customer demand. We believe that in all
material respects our properties have been satisfactorily maintained, are in good condition and are
suitable for our operations.

 2001 Long-Term Performance Plan (the “2001 Plan”) 
The 2001 Plan has been used to fund awards for employees other than senior executives of the Company.
Awards for senior executives of the Company have been and will continue to be funded from the
stockholder-approved 1999 Long-Term Performance Plan (the “1999 Plan”); the 1999 Plan is also used to
fund awards for employees other than senior executives, otherwise, the provisions of the 2001 Plan
are identical to the 1999 Plan, including the type of awards that may be granted under the plan
(stock options, restricted stock and unit awards and long-term performance incentive awards).
The 2001 Plan is administered by the Executive Compensation and Management Resources Committee of the
Board of Directors (the “Committee”), and that Committee may delegate to officers of the company
certain of its duties, powers and authority. Payment of awards may be made in the form of cash, stock
or combinations thereof and may be deferred with Committee approval. Awards are not transferable or
assignable except (i) by law, will or the laws of descent and distribution, (ii) as a result of the
disability of the recipient, or (iii) with the approval of the Committee.
If the employment of a participant terminates, other than as a result of the death or disability of a
participant, all unexercised, deferred and unpaid awards shall be canceled immediately, unless the
award agreement provides otherwise. In
 15 
the event of the death of a participant or in the event a participant is deemed by the company to be
disabled and eligible for benefits under the terms of the XYZ Inc Long-Term Disability Plan (or any
successor plan or similar plan of another employer), the participant’s estate, beneficiaries or
representative, as the case may be, shall have the rights and duties of the participant under the
applicable award agreement. In addition, unless the award agreement specifies otherwise, the
Committee may cancel, rescind, suspend, withhold or otherwise limit or restrict any unexpired,
unpaid, or deferred award at any time if the participant is not in compliance with all applicable
provisions of the awards agreement and the 2001 Plan. In addition, awards may be cancelled if the
participant engages in any conduct or act determined to be injurious, detrimental or prejudicial to
any interest of the company.
PWCC Acquisition Long-Term Performance Plan (the “PWCC Plan”)
The PWCC Plan was adopted by the Board of Directors in connection with the company’s acquisition of
PricewaterhouseCoopers Consulting (“PwCC”) from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, as announced on October
1, 2002. The PWCC Plan has been and will continue to be used solely to fund awards for employees of
PwCC who have become employed by the company as a result of the acquisition. Awards for senior
executives of the company will not be funded from the PWCC Plan. The terms and conditions of the PWCC
Plan are substantively identical to the terms and conditions of the 2001 Plan, described above.
XYZ Inc Red Hat Acquisition Long-Term Performance Plan (the “Red Hat Plan”)
The Red Hat Plan was adopted by the Board of Directors in connection with the company’s acquisition
of Red Hat, Inc. on July 9, 2019. The Red Hat Plan was used solely to fund awards for employees who
were not employed by XYZ Inc immediately prior to the closing of the acquisition. Awards for senior
executives of the company will not be funded from the Red Hat Plan. The terms and conditions of the
Red Hat Plan are substantively identical to the terms and conditions of the 2001 Plan, described
above.
Amended and Restated Deferred Compensation and Equity Award Plan (the “DCEAP”)
The DCEAP was adopted in 1993 and amended and restated effective January 1, 2014. Under the Amended
and Restated DCEAP, non-management directors receive Promised Fee Shares in connection with deferred
annual retainer payments. Each Promised Fee Share is equal in value to one share of the company’s
common stock. Upon a director’s retirement or other completion of service as a director, amounts
deferred into Promised Fee Shares are payable in either cash and/or shares of the company’s stock
either as lump sum or installments pursuant to the director’s distribution election. For additional
information about the DCEAP, refer to “Director Compensation under the XYZ Inc Deferred Compensation and
Equity Award Plan (DCEAP)” in XYZ Inc’s definitive Proxy Statement to be filed with the SEC and delivered

International Business Machines Corporation (XYZ Inc or the company) was incorporated in the State of New
York on June 16, 1911, as the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Co. (C-T-R), a consolidation of the
Computing Scale Co. of America, the Tabulating Machine Co. and The International Time Recording Co.
of New York. Since that time, XYZ Inc has focused on the intersection of business insight and
technological innovation, and its operations and aims have been international in nature. This was
signaled over 100 years ago, in 1924, when C-T-R changed its name to International Business Machines
Corporation. And it continues today—we create sustained value for clients by helping them leverage
the power of hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence (AI). Our hybrid cloud platform and AI
technology support clients’ digital transformations and helps them reimagine critical workflows, at
scale, and modernize applications to increase agility, drive innovation and create operational
efficiencies. Our offerings draw from leading XYZ Inc capabilities in software, consulting services
capability to deliver business outcomes, and deep incumbency in mission-critical infrastructure, all
bolstered by one of the world’s leading research organizations.

 Strategic Partnerships 
We proactively partner with a broad variety of companies including hyperscalers, service providers,
global system integrators, and software and hardware vendors. We work alongside our partners to
deliver end-to-end solutions that address our clients’ complex business challenges while accelerating
growth. Our strategic partners include: Adobe, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft, Oracle, Palo
Alto Networks, Salesforce, Samsung Electronics and SAP, among others.
Companies with which we have strategic partnerships in some areas may be competitors in other areas.
 Competition 
XYZ Inc is a globally integrated enterprise that participates in a highly competitive environment. Our
competitors vary by industry segment, and range from large multinational enterprises to smaller, more
narrowly focused entities. Across our business segments, we recognize hundreds of competitors
worldwide and as we execute our hybrid cloud and AI strategy, we are regularly exposed to new
competitors.
Our principal methods of competition are: technology innovation; performance; price; quality; brand;
our breadth of capabilities, products and services; talent; client relationships and trust; the
ability to deliver business value to clients; and service and support. In order to maintain
leadership, we optimize our portfolio with organic and inorganic innovations and effective resource
allocation. These investments not only drive current performance but will extend our innovation
leadership into the future.
Our breadth and depth of expertise enables us to take different technologies and bring them together
to solve the most pressing business issues of our clients. We differentiate from other providers by
bringing together incumbency with enterprises, deep expertise in technology, industries and business
processes, a broad go-to-market reach including an ecosystem of partners and alliances, and a strong
focus on innovation. All of these attributes position XYZ Inc for accelerated growth now and prepare us
for the next set of business opportunities, such as quantum computing.
 1 
Overall, the company is the leader or among the leaders in each of our business segments. A summary
of the competitive environment for each business segment is included below:
Software:
The depth, breadth, and innovation of our software offerings, coupled with our global reach, deep
industry expertise and research capabilities help differentiate our offerings from our competitors.
Our hybrid cloud and AI platforms allow clients to realize their digital and AI transformations
across the applications, data, and environments in which they operate. The principal competitors in
this segment include: Alphabet (Google), Amazon, BMC, Broadcom, Informatica, Microsoft, Oracle,
Salesforce, SAP and Splunk. We also compete with smaller, niche competitors in specific geographic
regions or product segments.
Consulting:
Consulting focuses on integrating skills on strategy, experience, technology and operations by domain
and industry. Consulting competes in a dynamic market including consulting, systems integration,
application development, application management and business process outsourcing services. Our broad-
based competitors include: Accenture, Capgemini, India-based service providers, management consulting
firms, the consulting practices of public accounting firms, engineering service providers, and many
companies that primarily focus on local markets or niche service areas.
Infrastructure:
XYZ Inc is well positioned in the growing hybrid cloud infrastructure market, providing on-premises and
cloud-based server and storage solutions. We gain advantage and differentiation through investments
in higher-value capabilities, including security, scalability, and reliability, designed especially
for mission-critical and AI workloads. In addition, we offer a portfolio of life-cycle services for
hybrid cloud infrastructure deployment. Our principal competitors include: Dell Technologies,
Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (HPE), Intel, NetApp and Pure Storage as well as original device

leveraging innovation in technology and service delivery to compete with traditional providers and to
offer additional routes to market for server and storage systems.
Financing:
Financing provides client and commercial financing, facilitating XYZ Inc clients’ acquisition of
hardware, software and services. Financing’s ability to manage credit and residual value risk
generates a competitive advantage for the company. The key competitive factors include: interest
rates charged, IT product experience, client service, contract flexibility, ease of doing business,
global capabilities and residual values. In client and commercial financing, Financing primarily
competes with non-captive financing entities and financial institutions.

 Risks Related to Our Business 
Downturn in Economic Environment and Client Spending Budgets Could Impact the Company’s Business: If
overall demand for XYZ Inc’s products and solutions decreases, whether due to general economic
conditions, or a shift in client buying patterns, the company’s revenue and profit could be impacted.
Failure of Innovation Initiatives Could Impact the Long-Term Success of the Company: XYZ Inc has moved
into areas, including those that incorporate or utilize hybrid cloud, AI and generative AI, quantum
and other disruptive technologies, in which it can differentiate itself through responsible
innovation, by leveraging its investments in R&D and attracting a successful developer ecosystem. If
XYZ Inc is unable to continue its cutting-edge innovation in a highly competitive and rapidly evolving
environment or is unable to commercialize such innovations, expand and scale them with sufficient
speed and versatility or is unable to attract a successful developer ecosystem, the company could
fail in its ongoing efforts to maintain and increase its market share and its profit margins.
Damage to XYZ Inc’s Reputation Could Impact the Company’s Business: XYZ Inc has one of the strongest brand
names in the world, and its brand and overall reputation could be negatively impacted by many
factors, including if the company does not continue to be recognized for its industry leading
technology and solutions and as a hybrid cloud and AI leader. XYZ Inc’s reputation is potentially
susceptible to damage by events such as significant disputes with clients, product defects, internal
control deficiencies, delivery failures, cybersecurity incidents, government investigations or legal
proceedings or actions of current or former clients, directors, employees, competitors, vendors,
alliance partners or joint venture partners. If the
 3 
company’s brand image is tarnished by negative perceptions, its ability to attract and retain
customers, talent and ecosystem partners could be impacted.
Risks from Investing in Growth Opportunities Could Impact the Company’s Business: The company
continues to invest significantly in key strategic areas, including AI and generative AI, to drive
revenue growth and market share gains. Client adoption rates and viable economic models are less
certain in the high-value, highly competitive, and rapidly-growing segments. Additionally, emerging
business and delivery models may unfavorably impact demand and profitability for our other products
or services. If the company does not adequately and timely anticipate and respond to changes in
customer and market preferences, competitive actions, disruptive technologies, emerging business
models and ecosystems, the client demand for our products or services may decline or XYZ Inc’s costs may
increase.
XYZ Inc’s Intellectual Property Portfolio May Not Prevent Competitive Offerings, and XYZ Inc May Not Be Able
to Obtain Necessary Licenses: The company’s patents and other intellectual property may not prevent
competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative to the
company’s, nor can there be any assurance that the resources invested by the company to protect its
intellectual property will be sufficient or that the company’s intellectual property portfolio will
adequately deter misappropriation or improper use of the company’s technology. In addition, the
company may be the target of aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by third parties,
including non-practicing entities. Also, there can be no assurances that XYZ Inc will be able to obtain
from third parties the licenses it needs in the future. The company’s ability to protect its
intellectual property could also be impacted by a lack of effective legal protections as well as
changes to existing laws, legal principles and regulations governing intellectual property, including
the ownership and protection of patents.
Certain of the company’s offerings incorporate or utilize open source and other third-party software
licensed with limited or no warranties, indemnification, or other contractual protections for XYZ Inc.
Further, if open source code that XYZ Inc utilizes is no longer maintained, developed or enhanced by the
relevant community of independent open source software programmers, most of whom we do not employ, we
may be unable to develop new technologies, adequately enhance our existing technologies or meet
customer requirements for innovation, quality and price.
Risks to the Company from Acquisitions, Alliances and Divestitures Include Integration Challenges,
Failure to Achieve Objectives, the Assumption or Retention of Liabilities and Higher Debt Levels: The
company has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions, alliances and divestitures. Such
transactions present significant challenges and risks and there can be no assurances that the company
will manage such transactions successfully, that strategic objectives will be achieved or that
strategic opportunities will be available to the company on acceptable terms or at all. With respect
to acquisitions and alliances, the related risks include the company failing to achieve anticipated
revenue improvements and cost savings, the failure to retain key personnel or strategic relationships
of acquired companies, the assumption of liabilities related to litigation or other legal proceedings
involving the businesses in such transactions, and delays in obtaining, or the failure to obtain,
necessary governmental or regulatory approvals, as well as the failure to close planned transactions.
Such transactions may require the company to secure financing and any significant disruption or
turmoil in the capital markets could have an adverse effect on XYZ Inc’s ability to access the capital
markets at favorable terms. From time to time, the company divests or attempts to divest assets that
are no longer central to its strategic objectives. Any such transaction is subject to risks,
including risks related to the terms and timing of such divestitures, risks related to retained
liabilities not subject to the company’s control, and delays in obtaining, or failing to obtain,
necessary governmental or regulatory approvals, as well as the failure to close planned transactions.
The Company’s Financial Results for Particular Periods Are Difficult to Predict: XYZ Inc’s revenues and
profitability are affected by such factors as the introduction of new products and services, the
ability to compete effectively in increasingly competitive marketplaces, the length of the sales
cycles and the seasonality of technology purchases. In addition, certain of the company’s growth
areas involve new products, new customers, new and evolving competitors, and new markets, all of
which contribute to the difficulty of predicting the company’s financial results. The company’s
financial results may also be impacted by the structure of products and services contracts and the
nature of its customers’ businesses; for example, certain of the company’s services contracts with
commercial customers in regulated industries are subject to periodic review by regulators with
respect to controls and processes. Further, general economic conditions, including sudden shifts in
regional or global economic activity may impact the company’s financial results in any particular
period. As a result of the above-mentioned factors, the company’s financial results are difficult to
predict. Historically, the company has had lower revenue in the first quarter than in the immediately
preceding fourth quarter. In addition, the high volume of products typically ordered at the end of
each quarter, especially at the end of the fourth quarter, make financial results for a given period
difficult to predict.
 4 
Due to the Company’s Global Presence, Its Business and Operations Could Be Impacted by Local Legal,
Economic, Political, Health and Other Conditions: The company is a globally integrated entity, doing
business in over 175 countries worldwide and deriving about sixty percent of its revenues from sales
outside the United States. Changes in the laws or policies of the countries in which the company
operates, or inadequate development or enforcement of such laws or policies, could affect the
company’s business and the company’s overall results of operations. Further, the company may be
impacted directly or indirectly by the development and enforcement of laws and regulations in the
U.S. and globally that are specifically targeted at the technology industry. The company’s results of
operations also could be affected by economic and political changes in those countries and by
macroeconomic changes, including recessions, inflation, currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar
and non-U.S. currencies, capital controls, and adverse changes in trade relationships amongst those
countries. Further, as the company expands its customer base and the scope of its offerings, both
within the U.S. and globally, it may be impacted by additional regulatory or other risks, including,
compliance with U.S. and foreign data privacy requirements, outbound investment restrictions, AI and
cloud regulations, data localization requirements, labor relations laws, enforcement of IP protection
laws, laws relating to anti-corruption, anti-competition regulations, and import, export and trade
restrictions. Further, international trade disputes could create uncertainty. Tariffs and
international trade sanctions resulting from these disputes could affect the company’s ability to
move goods and services across borders, or could impose added costs to those activities. Measures
taken to date by the company to mitigate these impacts could be made less effective should trade
sanctions or tariffs change. In addition, any widespread outbreak of an illness, pandemic or other
local or global health issue, natural disasters, climate change impacts, or uncertain political
climates, international hostilities, or any terrorist activities, could adversely affect customer
demand, the company’s operations and supply chain, and its ability to source and deliver products and
services to its customers.
The Company May Not Meet Its Growth and Productivity Objectives: On an ongoing basis, XYZ Inc seeks to
drive greater agility, productivity, flexibility and cost savings by continuously transforming with
the use of automation, AI, agile processes and changes to the ways of working, while also enabling
the scaling of resources, offerings and investments through the company’s globally integrated model
across both emerging and more established markets. These various initiatives may not yield their
intended gains in speed, quality, productivity and enablement of rapid scaling, which may impact the
company’s competitiveness and its ability to meet its growth and productivity objectives.
Ineffective Internal Controls Could Impact the Company’s Business and Operating Results: The
company’s internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because
of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, failure or interruption of
information technology systems, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Even effective
internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair
presentation of financial statements. If the company fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal
controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if the company
experiences difficulties in their implementation, the company’s business and operating results could
be harmed and the company could fail to meet its financial reporting obligations.
The Company’s Use of Accounting Estimates Involves Judgment and Could Impact the Company’s Financial
Results: The application of accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP) requires the
company to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect
its reported financial condition. The company’s most critical accounting estimates are described in
the Management Discussion in XYZ Inc’s 2024 Annual Report to Stockholders, under “Critical Accounting
Estimates.” In addition, as discussed in note Q, “Commitments & Contingencies,” in XYZ Inc’s 2024 Annual
Report to Stockholders, the company makes certain estimates including decisions related to legal
proceedings and reserves. These estimates and assumptions involve the use of judgment. As a result,
actual financial results may differ.
The Company’s Goodwill or Amortizable Intangible Assets May Become Impaired: The company acquires
other companies, including the intangible assets of those companies. The company may not realize all
the economic benefit from those acquisitions, which could cause an impairment of goodwill or
intangible assets. If our goodwill or net intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to
record a charge to the Consolidated Income Statement.
The Company Depends on Skilled Employees and Could Be Impacted by a Shortage of Critical Skills: Much
of the future success of the company depends on the continued service, availability and integrity of
skilled employees, including technical, marketing and staff resources. Skilled and experienced
personnel in the areas where the company competes are in high demand, and competition for their
talents is intense. Changing demographics and labor work force trends may result in a shortage of or
insufficient knowledge and skills. In addition, as global opportunities and industry demand shifts,
realignment, training and scaling of skilled resources may not be sufficiently rapid or successful.
Further, many of XYZ Inc’s key employees receive a total compensation package that includes equity
awards. Any new regulations, volatility in the
 5 
stock market and other factors could diminish the company’s use or the value of the company’s equity
awards, putting the company at a competitive disadvantage.
The Company’s Business Could Be Impacted by Its Relationships with Critical Suppliers: XYZ Inc’s business
employs a wide variety of components (hardware and software), supplies, services and raw materials
from a substantial number of suppliers around the world. Certain of the company’s businesses rely on
a single or a limited number of suppliers, including for server processor technology for certain
semiconductors. Changes in the business condition (financial or otherwise) of these suppliers could
subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring products to market. Further, the
failure of the company’s suppliers to deliver components, supplies, services and raw materials in
sufficient quantities, in a timely or secure manner, and in compliance with all applicable laws and
regulations could adversely affect the company’s business. In addition, any defective components,
supplies or materials, or inadequate services received from suppliers could reduce the reliability of
the company’s products and services and harm the company’s reputation.
Product and Service Quality Issues Could Impact the Company’s Business and Operating Results: The
company has rigorous quality control standards and governance processes intended to prevent, detect
and correct errors, malfunctions and other defects in its products and services. If errors,
malfunctions, defects or disruptions in service are experienced by customers or in the company’s
operations there could be negative consequences that could impact customers’ business operations and
harm the company’s business’s operating results.
The Development and Use of AI and Generative AI, including the Company’s Increased Offerings and Use
of AI-based Technologies, Could Impact the Long-Term Success of the Company and its Reputation or
Give Rise to Legal or Regulatory Action: XYZ Inc is increasingly applying AI-based technologies,
including generative AI, to its services and products, to how it delivers offerings to XYZ Inc clients,
and to its own internal operations. Additionally, XYZ Inc is investing in and offering new products and
services associated with AI development, deployment and management. As stated more comprehensively
and in context of several risk factors throughout this Item 1A., this increasing mix and application
of AI-based technologies may impact XYZ Inc’s ongoing efforts to maintain and increase its market share
and its profit margins or harm XYZ Inc’s reputation if the company does not continue to be recognized as
an AI leader with strong governance processes. XYZ Inc’s drive for greater agility, productivity,
flexibility and cost savings by continuously transforming with the use of AI may not yield intended
gains in speed, quality, productivity and enablement of rapid scaling, which may impact the company’s
competitiveness. The evolving global AI regulatory environment, including the enactment of the EU AI
Act, may affect the company’s business and the company’s overall results of operations. Computer
hackers and others routinely attack the security of technology products, services, systems and
networks using a wide variety of methods, and the increased use of generative AI may introduce novel
methods of attack. In the event of such actions, the company, its customers and other third parties
could be exposed to liability, litigation, and regulatory or other government action, including
debarment, as well as the loss of existing or potential customers, damage to brand and reputation,
damage to XYZ Inc’s competitive position, and other financial loss.
The Company Could Be Impacted by Its Business with Government Clients: The company’s customers
include numerous governmental entities within and outside the U.S., including the U.S. Federal
Government and state and local entities. Some of the company’s agreements with these customers may be
subject to periodic funding approval. Funding reductions, delays or work stoppages could adversely
impact public sector demand for our products and services. Also, some agreements may contain
provisions allowing the customer to terminate without cause and providing for higher liability limits
for certain losses. In addition, the company could be suspended or debarred as a governmental
contractor and could incur civil and criminal fines and penalties, which could negatively impact the
company’s results of operations, financial results and reputation.
The Company’s Reliance on Third-Party Distribution Channels and Ecosystems Could Impact Its Business:
The company offers its products directly and through a variety of third-party distributors,
resellers, independent software vendors, independent service providers, and other ecosystem partners.
Changes in the business condition (financial or otherwise) of these ecosystem partners could subject
the company to losses and affect its ability to bring its products to market. As the company moves
into new areas, ecosystem partners may be unable to keep up with changes in technology and offerings,
and the company may be unable to recruit and enable appropriate partners to achieve anticipated
ecosystem growth objectives. In addition, the failure of ecosystem partners to comply with all
applicable laws and regulations may prevent the company from working with them and could subject the
company to losses and affect its ability to bring products to market.
 6 
Cybersecurity, Privacy, and AI Considerations Could Impact the Company’s Business: There are numerous
and evolving risks to cybersecurity and privacy, including risks originating from intentional acts of
individual and groups of criminal hackers, hacktivists, state-sponsored organizations, nation states
and competitors; from intentional and unintentional acts or omissions of customers, contractors,
business partners, vendors, employees and other third parties; and from errors in processes or
technologies, as well as the risks associated with an increase in the number of customers,
contractors, business partners, vendors, employees and other third parties working remotely. Computer
hackers and others routinely attack the security of technology products, services, systems and
networks, like those we offer, using a wide variety of methods, including ransomware or other
malicious software and attempts to exploit vulnerabilities in hardware, software, and infrastructure,
and the increased use of generative AI may introduce novel methods of attack. Attacks also include
social engineering and cyber extortion to induce customers, contractors, business partners, vendors,
employees and other third parties to disclose information, transfer funds, or unwittingly provide
access to systems or data. The company is at risk of security breaches not only of our own products,
services, systems and networks, but also those of customers, contractors, business partners, vendors,
employees and other third parties, particularly as all parties increasingly digitize their
operations. Cyber threats are increasing in number and sophistication, continually evolving,
including with the increased use of AI, making it difficult to anticipate and defend against such
threats and vulnerabilities that can persist undetected over extended periods of time.
The company’s products, services, systems and networks, including cloud-based systems and systems and
technologies that the company maintains on behalf of its customers, are used in critical company,
customer or third-party operations, and involve the storage, processing and transmission of sensitive
data, including valuable intellectual property, other proprietary or confidential data, regulated
data, and personal information of employees, customers and others. These products, services, systems
and networks are also used by customers in heavily regulated industries, including those in the
financial services, healthcare, critical infrastructure and government sectors.
As is common in our industry and for a company our size, we continue to face and prepare for
cybersecurity threats. While the company continues to monitor for, identify, investigate, respond to
and remediate a wide range of cybersecurity events, there have not been cybersecurity incidents or
vulnerabilities that have had a material adverse effect on the company, though there is no assurance
that there will not be cybersecurity incidents or vulnerabilities that will have a material adverse
effect in the future.
The company regularly addresses cybersecurity attacks and vulnerabilities. Cybersecurity attacks or
other security incidents, including industry-wide incidents such as MOVEit, have or could result in,
for example, one or more of the following: unauthorized access to, disclosure, modification, misuse,
loss, or destruction of company, customer, or other third-party data or systems; theft or import or
export of sensitive, regulated, or confidential data including personal information and intellectual
property, including key innovations in AI, quantum, or other disruptive technologies; the loss of
access to critical data or systems through ransomware, crypto mining, destructive attacks or other
means; and business delays, service or system disruptions or denials of service.
In the event of such actions, the company, its customers and other third parties could be exposed to
liability, litigation, and regulatory or other government action, including debarment, as well as the
loss of existing or potential customers, damage to brand and reputation, damage to our competitive
position, and other financial loss. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of responding
to cybersecurity incidents and implementing remediation measures could be significant. In the
company’s industry, security vulnerabilities are increasingly discovered, publicized and exploited
across a broad range of hardware, software or other infrastructure, including in our own products,
services, systems and networks, or third-party data and systems upon which we rely, elevating the
risk of attacks and the potential cost of response and remediation for the company and its customers.
In addition, the fast-paced, evolving, pervasive, and sophisticated nature of certain cyber threats
and vulnerabilities, as well as the scale and complexity of the business and infrastructure, make it
possible that certain threats or vulnerabilities will be undetected or unmitigated in time to prevent
or minimize the impact of an attack on the company or its customers.
Cybersecurity risk to the company and its customers also depends on factors such as the actions,
practices and investments of customers, contractors, business partners, vendors, the open source
community and other third parties, including, for example, providing and implementing patches to
address vulnerabilities. Cybersecurity attacks or other catastrophic events resulting in disruptions
to or failures in power, information technology, communication systems or other critical
infrastructure could result in interruptions or delays to company, customer, or other third-party
operations or services, financial loss, injury or death to persons or property, potential liability,
and damage to brand and reputation.
 7 
Although the company continuously takes significant steps to mitigate cybersecurity risk across a
range of functions, such measures can never eliminate the risk entirely or provide absolute security.
As a global enterprise, the regulatory environment with regard to cybersecurity, privacy, AI and data
protection issues is increasingly complex and will continue to impact the company’s business,
including through increased risk, increased costs, and expanded or otherwise altered compliance
obligations, including with respect to the increased regulatory activity around the security of
critical infrastructure, IoT devices, customer industries (e.g., financial services) and various
customer and government supply chain security programs. As the reliance on data grows for the company
and our clients, the potential impact of regulations on the company’s business, risks, and reputation
will grow accordingly. The enactment and expansion of cybersecurity, AI, data protection and privacy
laws, regulations and standards around the globe will continue to result in increased compliance
costs, including due to an increased focus on international data transfer mechanisms and data
location; increased cybersecurity requirements and reporting obligations; the lack of harmonization
of such laws and regulations; the increase in associated litigation and enforcement activity by
governments and private parties; the potential for damages, fines and penalties and debarment; and
the potential regulation of new and emerging technologies. Any additional costs and penalties
associated with increased compliance, enforcement, and risk reduction could make certain offerings
less profitable or increase the difficulty of bringing certain offerings to market or maintaining
certain offerings.
 Risks Related to Laws and Regulations 
The Company Could Incur Substantial Costs Related to Climate Change and Other Environmental Matters:
XYZ Inc, like other companies, is subject to potential climate-related risks and costs such as those
resulting from increased severe weather events, prolonged changes in temperature, new regulations
affecting hardware products and data centers, carbon taxes, and increased environmental disclosures
requested or required by clients, regulators and others. The company is also subject to various
federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the
environment or otherwise related to environmental protection, including the U.S. Superfund law. The
company could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal
sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, if it were to
violate or become liable under environmental laws and regulations. We do not expect climate change or
compliance with environmental laws and regulations focused on climate change to have a
disproportionate effect on the company or its financial position, results of operations and
competitive position.
Tax Matters Could Impact the Company’s Results of Operations and Financial Condition: The company is
subject to income taxes in both the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. XYZ Inc’s provision
for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors
including, but not limited to, income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with
lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates,
changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in tax laws,
regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof, which could adversely impact the
company’s results of operations and financial condition in future periods. The Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has issued model rules for a new global minimum tax.
Local country adoption of these rules may increase tax uncertainty and may adversely impact the
company’s income taxes. Furthermore, local country, state, provincial or municipal taxation may also
be subject to review and potential override by regional, federal, national or similar forms of
government. In addition, XYZ Inc is subject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by
the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities around the world. The
company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to
determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes
from these examinations will not have an adverse effect on the company’s provision for income taxes
and cash tax liability.
The Company Is Subject to Legal Proceedings and Investigatory Risks: As a company with a substantial
employee population and with clients in more than 175 countries, XYZ Inc is or may become involved as a
party and/or may be subject to a variety of claims, demands, suits, investigations, tax matters and
other proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of its business. The risks
associated with such legal proceedings are described in more detail in note Q, “Commitments &
Contingencies,” in XYZ Inc’s 2024 Annual Report to Stockholders. The company believes it has adopted
appropriate risk management and compliance programs. Legal and compliance risks, however, will
continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies, the outcome of which
cannot be predicted with certainty, may arise from time to time.

Risks Related to Financing and Capital Markets Activities
The Company’s Results of Operations and Financial Condition Could Be Negatively Impacted by Its U.S.
and non-U.S. Pension Plans: Adverse financial market conditions and volatility in the credit markets
may have an unfavorable impact on the value of the company’s pension trust assets and its future
estimated pension liabilities. As a result, the company’s financial results in any period could be
negatively impacted. In addition, in a period of an extended financial market downturn, the company
could be required to provide incremental pension plan funding with resulting liquidity risk which
could negatively impact the company’s financial flexibility. Further, the company’s results could be
negatively impacted by premiums for mandatory pension insolvency insurance coverage outside the
United States. Premium increases could be significant due to the level of insolvencies of unrelated
companies in the country at issue. XYZ Inc’s 2024 Annual Report to Stockholders includes information
about potential impacts from pension funding and the use of certain assumptions regarding pension
matters.
The Company Is Exposed to Currency and Financing Risks That Could Impact Its Revenue and Business:
The company derives a significant percentage of its revenues and costs from its affiliates operating
in local currency environments, and those results are affected by changes in the relative values of
non-U.S. currencies and the U.S. dollar, as well as sudden shifts in regional or global economic
activity. Further, inherent in the company’s financing business are risks related to the
concentration of credit, client creditworthiness, interest rate and currency fluctuations on the
associated debt and liabilities and the determination of residual values. The company employs a
number of strategies to manage these risks, including the use of derivative financial instruments,
which involve the risk of non-performance by the counterparty. In addition, there can be no assurance
that the company’s efforts to manage its currency and financing risks will be successful.
The Company’s Financial Performance Could Be Impacted by Changes in Market Liquidity Conditions and
by Customer Credit Risk on Receivables: The company’s financial performance is exposed to a wide
variety of industry sector dynamics worldwide, including sudden shifts in regional or global economic
activity. The company’s earnings and cash flows, as well as its access to funding, could be
negatively impacted by changes in market liquidity conditions. XYZ Inc’s 2024 Annual Report to
Stockholders includes information about the company’s liquidity position. The company’s client base
includes many enterprises worldwide, from small and medium businesses to the world’s largest
organizations and governments, with a significant portion of the company’s revenue coming from global
clients across many sectors. Most of the company’s sales are on an open credit basis, and the company
performs ongoing credit evaluations of its clients’ financial conditions. If the company becomes
aware of information related to the creditworthiness of a major customer, or if future actual default
rates on receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the company may have to
adjust its allowance for credit losses, which could affect the company’s consolidated net income in
the period the adjustments are made.
 Risks Related to Ownership of XYZ Inc Securities 
Risk Factors Related to XYZ Inc Securities: The company and its subsidiaries issue debt securities in the
worldwide capital markets from time to time, with a variety of different maturities and in different
currencies. The value of the company’s debt securities fluctuates based on many factors, including
the methods employed for calculating principal and interest, the maturity of the securities, the
aggregate principal amount of securities outstanding, the redemption features for the securities, the
level, direction and volatility of interest rates, changes in exchange rates, exchange controls,
governmental and stock exchange regulations and other factors over which the company has little or no
control. The company’s ability to pay interest and repay the principal for its debt securities is
dependent upon its ability to manage its business operations, as well as the other risks described
under this Item 1A. entitled “Risk Factors.” There can be no assurance that the company will be able
to manage any of these risks successfully.
The company also issues its common stock from time to time in connection with various compensation
plans, contributions to its pension plan and certain acquisitions. The market price of XYZ Inc common
stock is subject to significant volatility, due to other factors described under this Item 1A.
entitled “Risk Factors,” as well as economic and geopolitical conditions generally, trading volumes,
speculation by the press or investment community about the company’s financial condition, and other
factors, many of which are beyond the company’s control. Since the market price of XYZ Inc’s common stock
fluctuates significantly, stockholders may not be able to sell the company’s stock at attractive
prices.
In addition, changes by any rating agency to the company’s outlook or credit ratings can negatively
impact the value and liquidity of both the company’s debt and equity securities. The company does not
make a market in either its debt or equity securities and cannot provide any assurances with respect
to the liquidity or value of suchsecurities.

Risk Management and Strategy
Cybersecurity is a critical part of risk management at XYZ Inc and is integrated with the company’s
overall enterprise risk management framework.The Board of Directors and the Audit Committee of the
Board are responsible for overseeing management’s execution of cybersecurity risk management and for
assessing XYZ Inc’s approach to risk management. Senior management is responsible for assessing and
managing XYZ Inc’s exposure to cybersecurity risks on an ongoing basis.
From an enterprise perspective, we implement a multi-faceted risk management approach based on the
National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework. We have established policies
and procedures that provide the foundation upon which XYZ Inc’s infrastructure and data are managed. We
regularly assess and adjust our technical controls and methods to identify and mitigate emerging
cybersecurity risks. We use a layered approach with overlapping controls to defend against
cybersecurity attacks and threats on XYZ Inc networks, end-user devices, servers, applications, data, and
cloud solutions.
We draw heavily on our own commercial security solutions and services to manage and mitigate
cybersecurity risks. XYZ Inc maintains a Security Operations Center (“SOC”) that monitors for threats to
XYZ Inc’s networks and systems, utilizing threat intelligence provided by a range of sources, including
the XYZ Inc Security X-Force Exchange platform, which maintains one of the largest compilations of threat
intelligence in the world. We also rely on tools licensed from third party security vendors to
monitor and manage cybersecurity risks. We periodically engage third parties to supplement and review
our cybersecurity practices and provide relevant certifications.
We have a global incident response process, managed by XYZ Inc’s Computer Security Incident Response Team
(“CSIRT”), that relies primarily on internal expertise to respond to cybersecurity threats and
attacks. We utilize a combination of online training, educational tools, videos and other awareness
initiatives to foster a culture of security awareness and responsibility among our workforce,
including responsibility for reporting suspicious activity.
XYZ Inc has a third party supplier risk management program to oversee and identify risks from
cybersecurity threats associated with its use of third party service providers and vendors. Risks are
assessed and prioritized based, among other things, on the type of offering/engagement, supplier
assessments, threat intelligence, and industry practices.
As discussed in greater detail in Item 1A., "Risk Factors," the company faces numerous and evolving
cybersecurity threats, including risks originating from the increased use of AI, intentional acts of
individual and groups of criminal hackers, hacktivists, state-sponsored organizations, nation states
and competitors; from intentional and unintentional acts or omissions of customers, contractors,
business partners, vendors, employees and other third parties; and from errors in processes or
technologies, as well as the risks associated with the number of customers, contractors, business
partners, vendors, employees and other third parties working remotely. While the company continues to
monitor for, identify, investigate, respond to and remediate cybersecurity risks, including incidents
and vulnerabilities, there have not been any that have had a material adverse effect on the company,
though there is no assurance that there will not be cybersecurity risks that will have a material
adverse effect in the future.
Governance
XYZ Inc’s Enterprise & Technology Security (“E&TS”) organization has oversight responsibility for the
security of both XYZ Inc’s internal systems and external offerings and works across all of the
organizations within the company to protect XYZ Inc, its brand, and its clients against cybersecurity
risks. E&TS also addresses cybersecurity risks associated with third party suppliers. For these
purposes, E&TS includes a dedicated Chief Information Security Officer (“CISO”) whose team is
responsible for leading enterprise-wide information security strategy, policy, standards,
architecture, and processes for XYZ Inc’s internal systems. The CISO manages the CSIRT. The CISO also
manages the Product Security Incident Response Team (“PSIRT”), which focuses on product
vulnerabilities potentially affecting the security of offerings sold to customers. XYZ Inc also has
Business Information Security Officers (“BISO”) who are coordinated by the Office of the CISO on
security issues specific to particular business segments.
 10 
The CSIRT team, together with the Office of the Chief Information Officer (“CIO”), Cyber Legal,
Corporate Security, and BISOs, engages in on-going reviews of incidents, threat intelligence,
detections, and vulnerabilities, including to assess client and regulatory impact. Events of interest
are promptly reported to the Senior Vice President (“SVP”) and Chief Legal Officer ("CLO"), and the
SVP overseeing cybersecurity (“SVP Sponsor”).
Incidents are delegated to an appropriate incident response team for assessment, investigation, and
remediation. Depending on the nature of the matter, the incident response team may include
individuals from E&TS, the Office of the CISO, the Office of the CIO, Cyber Legal, Business Units,
the Office of Privacy and Responsible Technology, Human Resources, Procurement, Finance and
Operations, and Corporate Security. The incident response teams advise and consult with the CLO and
the SVP Sponsor, as appropriate.
The Cybersecurity Advisory Committee (“CAC”)meets regularly and is responsible for overseeing
management of the Company’s cybersecurity risk. The CAC is composed of, among others, SVPs from the
major business units, the SVP Sponsor, and the CLO. The CAC is responsible for, among other things,
setting the Company’s governance structure for managing cybersecurity risk and reviewing noteworthy
cybersecurity incidents and strategies to prevent recurrence. XYZ Inc management responsible for managing
cybersecurity risk reflects a cross-section of functions from across the organization with
significant experience in managing such risk as well as the technologies underlying these risks. They
also hold leadership positions outside of XYZ Inc in the field of cybersecurity, serving on governing and
advisory boards of public and private institutions at the forefront of issues related to
cybersecurity, including technology development, cybersecurity policy, and national security.
The Board of Directors and the Audit Committee oversee the cyber governance process. Leadership from
E&TS, including the CISO, make regular presentations to the Audit Committee and the full Board on
identification, management, and remediation of cybersecurity risks, both internal and external, as
well as threat intelligence, emerging global policies and regulations, cybersecurity technologies,
and best practices.In addition, senior management provides briefings as needed to the Audit Committee
Chair, the Audit Committee, and, as appropriate, the full Board, on cybersecurity issues and
incidents of potential interest.
XYZ Inc ’s corporate headquarters are located at an owned site in Armonk, New York. As of December 31,
2024, in aggregate, we owned or leased facilities for current use consisting of approximat ely 41
million square feet worldwide.
At December 31, 2024, XYZ Inc’s facilities in the U.S. had aggregate floor space of approximately 17
million square feet, of which approximately 9 million was owned and 8 million was leased. Outside the
U.S., facilities totaled approximately 24 million square feet, of which 3 million was owned and 21
million was leased. This space is primarily used for sales and distribution, manufacturing and
development, data processing services including the company’s cloud centers, research and other
administrative and general support purposes. Our facilities are utilized for current operations of
all business segments.
Continuous optimization, maintenance and upgrading of facilities are essential to maintain our
technological leadership, improve productivity and meet customer demand. We believe that in all
material respects our properties have been satisfactorily maintained, are in good condition and are
suitable for our operations.

The material features of each equity compensation plan under which equity securities are authorized
for issuance that was adopted without stockholder approval are described below:
 2001 Long-Term Performance Plan (the “2001 Plan”) 
The 2001 Plan has been used to fund awards for employees other than senior executives of the Company.
Awards for senior executives of the Company have been and will continue to be funded from the
stockholder-approved 1999 Long-Term Performance Plan (the “1999 Plan”); the 1999 Plan is also used to
fund awards for employees other than senior executives, otherwise, the provisions of the 2001 Plan
are identical to the 1999 Plan, including the type of awards that may be granted under the plan
(stock options, restricted stock and unit awards and long-term performance incentive awards).
The 2001 Plan is administered by the Executive Compensation and Management Resources Committee of the
Board of Directors (the “Committee”), and that Committee may delegate to officers of the company
certain of its duties, powers and authority. Payment of awards may be made in the form of cash, stock
or combinations thereof and may be deferred with Committee approval. Awards are not transferable or
assignable except (i) by law, will or the laws of descent and distribution, (ii) as a result of the
disability of the recipient, or (iii) with the approval of the Committee.
If the employment of a participant terminates, other than as a result of the death or disability of a
participant, all unexercised, deferred and unpaid awards shall be canceled immediately, unless the
award agreement provides otherwise. In
 15 
the event of the death of a participant or in the event a participant is deemed by the company to be
disabled and eligible for benefits under the terms of the XYZ Inc Long-Term Disability Plan (or any
successor plan or similar plan of another employer), the participant’s estate, beneficiaries or
representative, as the case may be, shall have the rights and duties of the participant under the
applicable award agreement. In addition, unless the award agreement specifies otherwise, the
Committee may cancel, rescind, suspend, withhold or otherwise limit or restrict any unexpired,
unpaid, or deferred award at any time if the participant is not in compliance with all applicable
provisions of the awards agreement and the 2001 Plan. In addition, awards may be cancelled if the
participant engages in any conduct or act determined to be injurious, detrimental or prejudicial to
any interest of the company.
PWCC Acquisition Long-Term Performance Plan (the “PWCC Plan”)
The PWCC Plan was adopted by the Board of Directors in connection with the company’s acquisition of
PricewaterhouseCoopers Consulting (“PwCC”) from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, as announced on October
1, 2002. The PWCC Plan has been and will continue to be used solely to fund awards for employees of
PwCC who have become employed by the company as a result of the acquisition. Awards for senior
executives of the company will not be funded from the PWCC Plan. The terms and conditions of the PWCC
Plan are substantively identical to the terms and conditions of the 2001 Plan, described above.
XYZ Inc Red Hat Acquisition Long-Term Performance Plan (the “Red Hat Plan”)
The Red Hat Plan was adopted by the Board of Directors in connection with the company’s acquisition
of Red Hat, Inc. on July 9, 2019. The Red Hat Plan was used solely to fund awards for employees who
were not employed by XYZ Inc immediately prior to the closing of the acquisition. Awards for senior
executives of the company will not be funded from the Red Hat Plan. The terms and conditions of the
Red Hat Plan are substantively identical to the terms and conditions of the 2001 Plan, described
above.
Amended and Restated Deferred Compensation and Equity Award Plan (the “DCEAP”)
The DCEAP was adopted in 1993 and amended and restated effective January 1, 2014. Under the Amended
and Restated DCEAP, non-management directors receive Promised Fee Shares in connection with deferred
annual retainer payments. Each Promised Fee Share is equal in value to one share of the company’s
common stock. Upon a director’s retirement or other completion of service as a director, amounts
deferred into Promised Fee Shares are payable in either cash and/or shares of the company’s stock
either as lump sum or installments pursuant to the director’s distribution election. For additional
information about the DCEAP, refer to “Director Compensation under the XYZ Inc Deferred Compensation and
Equity Award Plan (DCEAP)” in XYZ Inc’s definitive Proxy Statement to be filed with the SEC and delivered

International Business Machines Corporation (XYZ Inc or the company) was incorporated in the State of New
York on June 16, 1911, as the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Co. (C-T-R), a consolidation of the
Computing Scale Co. of America, the Tabulating Machine Co. and The International Time Recording Co.
of New York. Since that time, XYZ Inc has focused on the intersection of business insight and
technological innovation, and its operations and aims have been international in nature. This was
signaled over 100 years ago, in 1924, when C-T-R changed its name to International Business Machines
Corporation. And it continues today—we create sustained value for clients by helping them leverage
the power of hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence (AI). Our hybrid cloud platform and AI
technology support clients’ digital transformations and helps them reimagine critical workflows, at
scale, and modernize applications to increase agility, drive innovation and create operational
efficiencies. Our offerings draw from leading XYZ Inc capabilities in software, consulting services
capability to deliver business outcomes, and deep incumbency in mission-critical infrastructure, all
bolstered by one of the world’s leading research organizations.

 Strategic Partnerships 
We proactively partner with a broad variety of companies including hyperscalers, service providers,
global system integrators, and software and hardware vendors. We work alongside our partners to
deliver end-to-end solutions that address our clients’ complex business challenges while accelerating
growth. Our strategic partners include: Adobe, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft, Oracle, Palo
Alto Networks, Salesforce, Samsung Electronics and SAP, among others.
Companies with which we have strategic partnerships in some areas may be competitors in other areas.
 Competition 
XYZ Inc is a globally integrated enterprise that participates in a highly competitive environment. Our
competitors vary by industry segment, and range from large multinational enterprises to smaller, more
narrowly focused entities. Across our business segments, we recognize hundreds of competitors
worldwide and as we execute our hybrid cloud and AI strategy, we are regularly exposed to new
competitors.
Our principal methods of competition are: technology innovation; performance; price; quality; brand;
our breadth of capabilities, products and services; talent; client relationships and trust; the
ability to deliver business value to clients; and service and support. In order to maintain
leadership, we optimize our portfolio with organic and inorganic innovations and effective resource
allocation. These investments not only drive current performance but will extend our innovation
leadership into the future.
Our breadth and depth of expertise enables us to take different technologies and bring them together
to solve the most pressing business issues of our clients. We differentiate from other providers by
bringing together incumbency with enterprises, deep expertise in technology, industries and business
processes, a broad go-to-market reach including an ecosystem of partners and alliances, and a strong
focus on innovation. All of these attributes position XYZ Inc for accelerated growth now and prepare us
for the next set of business opportunities, such as quantum computing.
 1 
Overall, the company is the leader or among the leaders in each of our business segments. A summary
of the competitive environment for each business segment is included below:
Software:
The depth, breadth, and innovation of our software offerings, coupled with our global reach, deep
industry expertise and research capabilities help differentiate our offerings from our competitors.
Our hybrid cloud and AI platforms allow clients to realize their digital and AI transformations
across the applications, data, and environments in which they operate. The principal competitors in
this segment include: Alphabet (Google), Amazon, BMC, Broadcom, Informatica, Microsoft, Oracle,
Salesforce, SAP and Splunk. We also compete with smaller, niche competitors in specific geographic
regions or product segments.
Consulting:
Consulting focuses on integrating skills on strategy, experience, technology and operations by domain
and industry. Consulting competes in a dynamic market including consulting, systems integration,
application development, application management and business process outsourcing services. Our broad-
based competitors include: Accenture, Capgemini, India-based service providers, management consulting
firms, the consulting practices of public accounting firms, engineering service providers, and many
companies that primarily focus on local markets or niche service areas.
Infrastructure:
XYZ Inc is well positioned in the growing hybrid cloud infrastructure market, providing on-premises and
cloud-based server and storage solutions. We gain advantage and differentiation through investments
in higher-value capabilities, including security, scalability, and reliability, designed especially
for mission-critical and AI workloads. In addition, we offer a portfolio of life-cycle services for
hybrid cloud infrastructure deployment. Our principal competitors include: Dell Technologies,
Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (HPE), Intel, NetApp and Pure Storage as well as original device

hardware, software and services. Financing’s ability to manage credit and residual value risk
generates a competitive advantage for the company. The key competitive factors include: interest
rates charged, IT product experience, client service, contract flexibility, ease of doing business,
global capabilities and residual values. In client and commercial financing, Financing primarily
competes with non-captive financing entities and financial institutions.

 Risks Related to Our Business 
Downturn in Economic Environment and Client Spending Budgets Could Impact the Company’s Business: If
overall demand for XYZ Inc’s products and solutions decreases, whether due to general economic
conditions, or a shift in client buying patterns, the company’s revenue and profit could be impacted.
Failure of Innovation Initiatives Could Impact the Long-Term Success of the Company: XYZ Inc has moved
into areas, including those that incorporate or utilize hybrid cloud, AI and generative AI, quantum
and other disruptive technologies, in which it can differentiate itself through responsible
innovation, by leveraging its investments in R&D and attracting a successful developer ecosystem. If
XYZ Inc is unable to continue its cutting-edge innovation in a highly competitive and rapidly evolving
environment or is unable to commercialize such innovations, expand and scale them with sufficient
speed and versatility or is unable to attract a successful developer ecosystem, the company could
fail in its ongoing efforts to maintain and increase its market share and its profit margins.
Damage to XYZ Inc’s Reputation Could Impact the Company’s Business: XYZ Inc has one of the strongest brand
names in the world, and its brand and overall reputation could be negatively impacted by many
factors, including if the company does not continue to be recognized for its industry leading
technology and solutions and as a hybrid cloud and AI leader. XYZ Inc’s reputation is potentially
susceptible to damage by events such as significant disputes with clients, product defects, internal
control deficiencies, delivery failures, cybersecurity incidents, government investigations or legal
proceedings or actions of current or former clients, directors, employees, competitors, vendors,
alliance partners or joint venture partners. If the
 3 
company’s brand image is tarnished by negative perceptions, its ability to attract and retain
customers, talent and ecosystem partners could be impacted.
Risks from Investing in Growth Opportunities Could Impact the Company’s Business: The company
continues to invest significantly in key strategic areas, including AI and generative AI, to drive
revenue growth and market share gains. Client adoption rates and viable economic models are less
certain in the high-value, highly competitive, and rapidly-growing segments. Additionally, emerging
business and delivery models may unfavorably impact demand and profitability for our other products
or services. If the company does not adequately and timely anticipate and respond to changes in
customer and market preferences, competitive actions, disruptive technologies, emerging business
models and ecosystems, the client demand for our products or services may decline or XYZ Inc’s costs may
increase.
XYZ Inc’s Intellectual Property Portfolio May Not Prevent Competitive Offerings, and XYZ Inc May Not Be Able
to Obtain Necessary Licenses: The company’s patents and other intellectual property may not prevent
competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative to the
company’s, nor can there be any assurance that the resources invested by the company to protect its
intellectual property will be sufficient or that the company’s intellectual property portfolio will
adequately deter misappropriation or improper use of the company’s technology. In addition, the
company may be the target of aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by third parties,
including non-practicing entities. Also, there can be no assurances that XYZ Inc will be able to obtain
from third parties the licenses it needs in the future. The company’s ability to protect its
intellectual property could also be impacted by a lack of effective legal protections as well as
changes to existing laws, legal principles and regulations governing intellectual property, including
the ownership and protection of patents.
Certain of the company’s offerings incorporate or utilize open source and other third-party software
licensed with limited or no warranties, indemnification, or other contractual protections for XYZ Inc.
Further, if open source code that XYZ Inc utilizes is no longer maintained, developed or enhanced by the
relevant community of independent open source software programmers, most of whom we do not employ, we
may be unable to develop new technologies, adequately enhance our existing technologies or meet
customer requirements for innovation, quality and price.
Risks to the Company from Acquisitions, Alliances and Divestitures Include Integration Challenges,
Failure to Achieve Objectives, the Assumption or Retention of Liabilities and Higher Debt Levels: The
company has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions, alliances and divestitures. Such
transactions present significant challenges and risks and there can be no assurances that the company
will manage such transactions successfully, that strategic objectives will be achieved or that
strategic opportunities will be available to the company on acceptable terms or at all. With respect
to acquisitions and alliances, the related risks include the company failing to achieve anticipated
revenue improvements and cost savings, the failure to retain key personnel or strategic relationships
of acquired companies, the assumption of liabilities related to litigation or other legal proceedings
involving the businesses in such transactions, and delays in obtaining, or the failure to obtain,
necessary governmental or regulatory approvals, as well as the failure to close planned transactions.
Such transactions may require the company to secure financing and any significant disruption or
turmoil in the capital markets could have an adverse effect on XYZ Inc’s ability to access the capital
markets at favorable terms. From time to time, the company divests or attempts to divest assets that
are no longer central to its strategic objectives. Any such transaction is subject to risks,
including risks related to the terms and timing of such divestitures, risks related to retained
liabilities not subject to the company’s control, and delays in obtaining, or failing to obtain,
necessary governmental or regulatory approvals, as well as the failure to close planned transactions.
The Company’s Financial Results for Particular Periods Are Difficult to Predict: XYZ Inc’s revenues and
profitability are affected by such factors as the introduction of new products and services, the
ability to compete effectively in increasingly competitive marketplaces, the length of the sales
cycles and the seasonality of technology purchases. In addition, certain of the company’s growth
areas involve new products, new customers, new and evolving competitors, and new markets, all of
which contribute to the difficulty of predicting the company’s financial results. The company’s
financial results may also be impacted by the structure of products and services contracts and the
nature of its customers’ businesses; for example, certain of the company’s services contracts with
commercial customers in regulated industries are subject to periodic review by regulators with
respect to controls and processes. Further, general economic conditions, including sudden shifts in
regional or global economic activity may impact the company’s financial results in any particular
period. As a result of the above-mentioned factors, the company’s financial results are difficult to
predict. Historically, the company has had lower revenue in the first quarter than in the immediately
preceding fourth quarter. In addition, the high volume of products typically ordered at the end of
each quarter, especially at the end of the fourth quarter, make financial results for a given period
difficult to predict.
 4 
Due to the Company’s Global Presence, Its Business and Operations Could Be Impacted by Local Legal,
Economic, Political, Health and Other Conditions: The company is a globally integrated entity, doing
business in over 175 countries worldwide and deriving about sixty percent of its revenues from sales
outside the United States. Changes in the laws or policies of the countries in which the company
operates, or inadequate development or enforcement of such laws or policies, could affect the
company’s business and the company’s overall results of operations. Further, the company may be
impacted directly or indirectly by the development and enforcement of laws and regulations in the
U.S. and globally that are specifically targeted at the technology industry. The company’s results of
operations also could be affected by economic and political changes in those countries and by
macroeconomic changes, including recessions, inflation, currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar
and non-U.S. currencies, capital controls, and adverse changes in trade relationships amongst those
countries. Further, as the company expands its customer base and the scope of its offerings, both
within the U.S. and globally, it may be impacted by additional regulatory or other risks, including,
compliance with U.S. and foreign data privacy requirements, outbound investment restrictions, AI and
cloud regulations, data localization requirements, labor relations laws, enforcement of IP protection
laws, laws relating to anti-corruption, anti-competition regulations, and import, export and trade
restrictions. Further, international trade disputes could create uncertainty. Tariffs and
international trade sanctions resulting from these disputes could affect the company’s ability to
move goods and services across borders, or could impose added costs to those activities. Measures
taken to date by the company to mitigate these impacts could be made less effective should trade
sanctions or tariffs change. In addition, any widespread outbreak of an illness, pandemic or other
local or global health issue, natural disasters, climate change impacts, or uncertain political
climates, international hostilities, or any terrorist activities, could adversely affect customer
demand, the company’s operations and supply chain, and its ability to source and deliver products and
services to its customers.
The Company May Not Meet Its Growth and Productivity Objectives: On an ongoing basis, XYZ Inc seeks to
drive greater agility, productivity, flexibility and cost savings by continuously transforming with
the use of automation, AI, agile processes and changes to the ways of working, while also enabling
the scaling of resources, offerings and investments through the company’s globally integrated model
across both emerging and more established markets. These various initiatives may not yield their
intended gains in speed, quality, productivity and enablement of rapid scaling, which may impact the
company’s competitiveness and its ability to meet its growth and productivity objectives.
Ineffective Internal Controls Could Impact the Company’s Business and Operating Results: The
company’s internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because
of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, failure or interruption of
information technology systems, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Even effective
internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair
presentation of financial statements. If the company fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal
controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if the company
experiences difficulties in their implementation, the company’s business and operating results could
be harmed and the company could fail to meet its financial reporting obligations.
The Company’s Use of Accounting Estimates Involves Judgment and Could Impact the Company’s Financial
Results: The application of accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP) requires the
company to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect
its reported financial condition. The company’s most critical accounting estimates are described in
the Management Discussion in XYZ Inc’s 2024 Annual Report to Stockholders, under “Critical Accounting
Estimates.” In addition, as discussed in note Q, “Commitments & Contingencies,” in XYZ Inc’s 2024 Annual
Report to Stockholders, the company makes certain estimates including decisions related to legal
proceedings and reserves. These estimates and assumptions involve the use of judgment. As a result,
actual financial results may differ.
The Company’s Goodwill or Amortizable Intangible Assets May Become Impaired: The company acquires
other companies, including the intangible assets of those companies. The company may not realize all
the economic benefit from those acquisitions, which could cause an impairment of goodwill or
intangible assets. If our goodwill or net intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to
record a charge to the Consolidated Income Statement.
The Company Depends on Skilled Employees and Could Be Impacted by a Shortage of Critical Skills: Much
of the future success of the company depends on the continued service, availability and integrity of
skilled employees, including technical, marketing and staff resources. Skilled and experienced
personnel in the areas where the company competes are in high demand, and competition for their
talents is intense. Changing demographics and labor work force trends may result in a shortage of or
insufficient knowledge and skills. In addition, as global opportunities and industry demand shifts,
realignment, training and scaling of skilled resources may not be sufficiently rapid or successful.
Further, many of XYZ Inc’s key employees receive a total compensation package that includes equity
awards. Any new regulations, volatility in the
 5 
stock market and other factors could diminish the company’s use or the value of the company’s equity
awards, putting the company at a competitive disadvantage.
The Company’s Business Could Be Impacted by Its Relationships with Critical Suppliers: XYZ Inc’s business
employs a wide variety of components (hardware and software), supplies, services and raw materials
from a substantial number of suppliers around the world. Certain of the company’s businesses rely on
a single or a limited number of suppliers, including for server processor technology for certain
semiconductors. Changes in the business condition (financial or otherwise) of these suppliers could
subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring products to market. Further, the
failure of the company’s suppliers to deliver components, supplies, services and raw materials in
sufficient quantities, in a timely or secure manner, and in compliance with all applicable laws and
regulations could adversely affect the company’s business. In addition, any defective components,
supplies or materials, or inadequate services received from suppliers could reduce the reliability of
the company’s products and services and harm the company’s reputation.
Product and Service Quality Issues Could Impact the Company’s Business and Operating Results: The
company has rigorous quality control standards and governance processes intended to prevent, detect
and correct errors, malfunctions and other defects in its products and services. If errors,
malfunctions, defects or disruptions in service are experienced by customers or in the company’s
operations there could be negative consequences that could impact customers’ business operations and
harm the company’s business’s operating results.
The Development and Use of AI and Generative AI, including the Company’s Increased Offerings and Use
of AI-based Technologies, Could Impact the Long-Term Success of the Company and its Reputation or
Give Rise to Legal or Regulatory Action: XYZ Inc is increasingly applying AI-based technologies,
including generative AI, to its services and products, to how it delivers offerings to XYZ Inc clients,
and to its own internal operations. Additionally, XYZ Inc is investing in and offering new products and
services associated with AI development, deployment and management. As stated more comprehensively
and in context of several risk factors throughout this Item 1A., this increasing mix and application
of AI-based technologies may impact XYZ Inc’s ongoing efforts to maintain and increase its market share
and its profit margins or harm XYZ Inc’s reputation if the company does not continue to be recognized as
an AI leader with strong governance processes. XYZ Inc’s drive for greater agility, productivity,
flexibility and cost savings by continuously transforming with the use of AI may not yield intended
gains in speed, quality, productivity and enablement of rapid scaling, which may impact the company’s
competitiveness. The evolving global AI regulatory environment, including the enactment of the EU AI
Act, may affect the company’s business and the company’s overall results of operations. Computer
hackers and others routinely attack the security of technology products, services, systems and
networks using a wide variety of methods, and the increased use of generative AI may introduce novel
methods of attack. In the event of such actions, the company, its customers and other third parties
could be exposed to liability, litigation, and regulatory or other government action, including
debarment, as well as the loss of existing or potential customers, damage to brand and reputation,
damage to XYZ Inc’s competitive position, and other financial loss.
The Company Could Be Impacted by Its Business with Government Clients: The company’s customers
include numerous governmental entities within and outside the U.S., including the U.S. Federal
Government and state and local entities. Some of the company’s agreements with these customers may be
subject to periodic funding approval. Funding reductions, delays or work stoppages could adversely
impact public sector demand for our products and services. Also, some agreements may contain
provisions allowing the customer to terminate without cause and providing for higher liability limits
for certain losses. In addition, the company could be suspended or debarred as a governmental
contractor and could incur civil and criminal fines and penalties, which could negatively impact the
company’s results of operations, financial results and reputation.
The Company’s Reliance on Third-Party Distribution Channels and Ecosystems Could Impact Its Business:
The company offers its products directly and through a variety of third-party distributors,
resellers, independent software vendors, independent service providers, and other ecosystem partners.
Changes in the business condition (financial or otherwise) of these ecosystem partners could subject
the company to losses and affect its ability to bring its products to market. As the company moves
into new areas, ecosystem partners may be unable to keep up with changes in technology and offerings,
and the company may be unable to recruit and enable appropriate partners to achieve anticipated
ecosystem growth objectives. In addition, the failure of ecosystem partners to comply with all
applicable laws and regulations may prevent the company from working with them and could subject the
company to losses and affect its ability to bring products to market.
 6 
Cybersecurity, Privacy, and AI Considerations Could Impact the Company’s Business: There are numerous
and evolving risks to cybersecurity and privacy, including risks originating from intentional acts of
individual and groups of criminal hackers, hacktivists, state-sponsored organizations, nation states
and competitors; from intentional and unintentional acts or omissions of customers, contractors,
business partners, vendors, employees and other third parties; and from errors in processes or
technologies, as well as the risks associated with an increase in the number of customers,
contractors, business partners, vendors, employees and other third parties working remotely. Computer
hackers and others routinely attack the security of technology products, services, systems and
networks, like those we offer, using a wide variety of methods, including ransomware or other
malicious software and attempts to exploit vulnerabilities in hardware, software, and infrastructure,
and the increased use of generative AI may introduce novel methods of attack. Attacks also include
social engineering and cyber extortion to induce customers, contractors, business partners, vendors,
employees and other third parties to disclose information, transfer funds, or unwittingly provide
access to systems or data. The company is at risk of security breaches not only of our own products,
services, systems and networks, but also those of customers, contractors, business partners, vendors,
employees and other third parties, particularly as all parties increasingly digitize their
operations. Cyber threats are increasing in number and sophistication, continually evolving,
including with the increased use of AI, making it difficult to anticipate and defend against such
threats and vulnerabilities that can persist undetected over extended periods of time.
The company’s products, services, systems and networks, including cloud-based systems and systems and
technologies that the company maintains on behalf of its customers, are used in critical company,
customer or third-party operations, and involve the storage, processing and transmission of sensitive
data, including valuable intellectual property, other proprietary or confidential data, regulated
data, and personal information of employees, customers and others. These products, services, systems
and networks are also used by customers in heavily regulated industries, including those in the
financial services, healthcare, critical infrastructure and government sectors.
As is common in our industry and for a company our size, we continue to face and prepare for
cybersecurity threats. While the company continues to monitor for, identify, investigate, respond to
and remediate a wide range of cybersecurity events, there have not been cybersecurity incidents or
vulnerabilities that have had a material adverse effect on the company, though there is no assurance
that there will not be cybersecurity incidents or vulnerabilities that will have a material adverse
effect in the future.
The company regularly addresses cybersecurity attacks and vulnerabilities. Cybersecurity attacks or
other security incidents, including industry-wide incidents such as MOVEit, have or could result in,
for example, one or more of the following: unauthorized access to, disclosure, modification, misuse,
loss, or destruction of company, customer, or other third-party data or systems; theft or import or
export of sensitive, regulated, or confidential data including personal information and intellectual
property, including key innovations in AI, quantum, or other disruptive technologies; the loss of
access to critical data or systems through ransomware, crypto mining, destructive attacks or other
means; and business delays, service or system disruptions or denials of service.
In the event of such actions, the company, its customers and other third parties could be exposed to
liability, litigation, and regulatory or other government action, including debarment, as well as the
loss of existing or potential customers, damage to brand and reputation, damage to our competitive
position, and other financial loss. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of responding
to cybersecurity incidents and implementing remediation measures could be significant. In the
company’s industry, security vulnerabilities are increasingly discovered, publicized and exploited
across a broad range of hardware, software or other infrastructure, including in our own products,
services, systems and networks, or third-party data and systems upon which we rely, elevating the
risk of attacks and the potential cost of response and remediation for the company and its customers.
In addition, the fast-paced, evolving, pervasive, and sophisticated nature of certain cyber threats
and vulnerabilities, as well as the scale and complexity of the business and infrastructure, make it
possible that certain threats or vulnerabilities will be undetected or unmitigated in time to prevent
or minimize the impact of an attack on the company or its customers.
Cybersecurity risk to the company and its customers also depends on factors such as the actions,
practices and investments of customers, contractors, business partners, vendors, the open source
community and other third parties, including, for example, providing and implementing patches to
address vulnerabilities. Cybersecurity attacks or other catastrophic events resulting in disruptions
to or failures in power, information technology, communication systems or other critical
infrastructure could result in interruptions or delays to company, customer, or other third-party
operations or services, financial loss, injury or death to persons or property, potential liability,
and damage to brand and reputation.
 7 
Although the company continuously takes significant steps to mitigate cybersecurity risk across a
range of functions, such measures can never eliminate the risk entirely or provide absolute security.
As a global enterprise, the regulatory environment with regard to cybersecurity, privacy, AI and data
protection issues is increasingly complex and will continue to impact the company’s business,
including through increased risk, increased costs, and expanded or otherwise altered compliance
obligations, including with respect to the increased regulatory activity around the security of
critical infrastructure, IoT devices, customer industries (e.g., financial services) and various
customer and government supply chain security programs. As the reliance on data grows for the company
and our clients, the potential impact of regulations on the company’s business, risks, and reputation
will grow accordingly. The enactment and expansion of cybersecurity, AI, data protection and privacy
laws, regulations and standards around the globe will continue to result in increased compliance
costs, including due to an increased focus on international data transfer mechanisms and data
location; increased cybersecurity requirements and reporting obligations; the lack of harmonization
of such laws and regulations; the increase in associated litigation and enforcement activity by
governments and private parties; the potential for damages, fines and penalties and debarment; and
the potential regulation of new and emerging technologies. Any additional costs and penalties
associated with increased compliance, enforcement, and risk reduction could make certain offerings
less profitable or increase the difficulty of bringing certain offerings to market or maintaining
certain offerings.
 Risks Related to Laws and Regulations 
The Company Could Incur Substantial Costs Related to Climate Change and Other Environmental Matters:
XYZ Inc, like other companies, is subject to potential climate-related risks and costs such as those
resulting from increased severe weather events, prolonged changes in temperature, new regulations
affecting hardware products and data centers, carbon taxes, and increased environmental disclosures
requested or required by clients, regulators and others. The company is also subject to various
federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the
environment or otherwise related to environmental protection, including the U.S. Superfund law. The
company could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal
sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, if it were to
violate or become liable under environmental laws and regulations. We do not expect climate change or
compliance with environmental laws and regulations focused on climate change to have a
disproportionate effect on the company or its financial position, results of operations and
competitive position.
Tax Matters Could Impact the Company’s Results of Operations and Financial Condition: The company is
subject to income taxes in both the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. XYZ Inc’s provision
for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors
including, but not limited to, income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with
lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates,
changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in tax laws,
regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof, which could adversely impact the
company’s results of operations and financial condition in future periods. The Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has issued model rules for a new global minimum tax.
Local country adoption of these rules may increase tax uncertainty and may adversely impact the
company’s income taxes. Furthermore, local country, state, provincial or municipal taxation may also
be subject to review and potential override by regional, federal, national or similar forms of
government. In addition, XYZ Inc is subject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by
the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities around the world. The
company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to
determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes
from these examinations will not have an adverse effect on the company’s provision for income taxes
and cash tax liability.
The Company Is Subject to Legal Proceedings and Investigatory Risks: As a company with a substantial
employee population and with clients in more than 175 countries, XYZ Inc is or may become involved as a
party and/or may be subject to a variety of claims, demands, suits, investigations, tax matters and
other proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of its business. The risks
associated with such legal proceedings are described in more detail in note Q, “Commitments &
Contingencies,” in XYZ Inc’s 2024 Annual Report to Stockholders. The company believes it has adopted
appropriate risk management and compliance programs. Legal and compliance risks, however, will
continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies, the outcome of which
cannot be predicted with certainty, may arise from time to time.

Risks Related to Financing and Capital Markets Activities
The Company’s Results of Operations and Financial Condition Could Be Negatively Impacted by Its U.S.
and non-U.S. Pension Plans: Adverse financial market conditions and volatility in the credit markets
may have an unfavorable impact on the value of the company’s pension trust assets and its future
estimated pension liabilities. As a result, the company’s financial results in any period could be
negatively impacted. In addition, in a period of an extended financial market downturn, the company
could be required to provide incremental pension plan funding with resulting liquidity risk which
could negatively impact the company’s financial flexibility. Further, the company’s results could be
negatively impacted by premiums for mandatory pension insolvency insurance coverage outside the
United States. Premium increases could be significant due to the level of insolvencies of unrelated
companies in the country at issue. XYZ Inc’s 2024 Annual Report to Stockholders includes information
about potential impacts from pension funding and the use of certain assumptions regarding pension
matters.
The Company Is Exposed to Currency and Financing Risks That Could Impact Its Revenue and Business:
The company derives a significant percentage of its revenues and costs from its affiliates operating
in local currency environments, and those results are affected by changes in the relative values of
non-U.S. currencies and the U.S. dollar, as well as sudden shifts in regional or global economic
activity. Further, inherent in the company’s financing business are risks related to the
concentration of credit, client creditworthiness, interest rate and currency fluctuations on the
associated debt and liabilities and the determination of residual values. The company employs a
number of strategies to manage these risks, including the use of derivative financial instruments,
which involve the risk of non-performance by the counterparty. In addition, there can be no assurance
that the company’s efforts to manage its currency and financing risks will be successful.
The Company’s Financial Performance Could Be Impacted by Changes in Market Liquidity Conditions and
by Customer Credit Risk on Receivables: The company’s financial performance is exposed to a wide
variety of industry sector dynamics worldwide, including sudden shifts in regional or global economic
activity. The company’s earnings and cash flows, as well as its access to funding, could be
negatively impacted by changes in market liquidity conditions. XYZ Inc’s 2024 Annual Report to
Stockholders includes information about the company’s liquidity position. The company’s client base
includes many enterprises worldwide, from small and medium businesses to the world’s largest
organizations and governments, with a significant portion of the company’s revenue coming from global
clients across many sectors. Most of the company’s sales are on an open credit basis, and the company
performs ongoing credit evaluations of its clients’ financial conditions. If the company becomes
aware of information related to the creditworthiness of a major customer, or if future actual default
rates on receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the company may have to
adjust its allowance for credit losses, which could affect the company’s consolidated net income in
the period the adjustments are made.
 Risks Related to Ownership of XYZ Inc Securities 
Risk Factors Related to XYZ Inc Securities: The company and its subsidiaries issue debt securities in the
worldwide capital markets from time to time, with a variety of different maturities and in different
currencies. The value of the company’s debt securities fluctuates based on many factors, including
the methods employed for calculating principal and interest, the maturity of the securities, the
aggregate principal amount of securities outstanding, the redemption features for the securities, the
level, direction and volatility of interest rates, changes in exchange rates, exchange controls,
governmental and stock exchange regulations and other factors over which the company has little or no
control. The company’s ability to pay interest and repay the principal for its debt securities is
dependent upon its ability to manage its business operations, as well as the other risks described
under this Item 1A. entitled “Risk Factors.” There can be no assurance that the company will be able
to manage any of these risks successfully.
The company also issues its common stock from time to time in connection with various compensation
plans, contributions to its pension plan and certain acquisitions. The market price of XYZ Inc common
stock is subject to significant volatility, due to other factors described under this Item 1A.
entitled “Risk Factors,” as well as economic and geopolitical conditions generally, trading volumes,
speculation by the press or investment community about the company’s financial condition, and other
factors, many of which are beyond the company’s control. Since the market price of XYZ Inc’s common stock
fluctuates significantly, stockholders may not be able to sell the company’s stock at attractive
prices.
In addition, changes by any rating agency to the company’s outlook or credit ratings can negatively
impact the value and liquidity of both the company’s debt and equity securities. The company does not
make a market in either its debt or equity securities and cannot provide any assurances with respect
to the liquidity or value of suchsecurities.

Risk Management and Strategy
Cybersecurity is a critical part of risk management at XYZ Inc and is integrated with the company’s
overall enterprise risk management framework.The Board of Directors and the Audit Committee of the
Board are responsible for overseeing management’s execution of cybersecurity risk management and for
assessing XYZ Inc’s approach to risk management. Senior management is responsible for assessing and
managing XYZ Inc’s exposure to cybersecurity risks on an ongoing basis.
From an enterprise perspective, we implement a multi-faceted risk management approach based on the
National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework. We have established policies
and procedures that provide the foundation upon which XYZ Inc’s infrastructure and data are managed. We
regularly assess and adjust our technical controls and methods to identify and mitigate emerging
cybersecurity risks. We use a layered approach with overlapping controls to defend against
cybersecurity attacks and threats on XYZ Inc networks, end-user devices, servers, applications, data, and
cloud solutions.
We draw heavily on our own commercial security solutions and services to manage and mitigate
cybersecurity risks. XYZ Inc maintains a Security Operations Center (“SOC”) that monitors for threats to
XYZ Inc’s networks and systems, utilizing threat intelligence provided by a range of sources, including
the XYZ Inc Security X-Force Exchange platform, which maintains one of the largest compilations of threat
intelligence in the world. We also rely on tools licensed from third party security vendors to
monitor and manage cybersecurity risks. We periodically engage third parties to supplement and review
our cybersecurity practices and provide relevant certifications.
We have a global incident response process, managed by XYZ Inc’s Computer Security Incident Response Team
(“CSIRT”), that relies primarily on internal expertise to respond to cybersecurity threats and
attacks. We utilize a combination of online training, educational tools, videos and other awareness
initiatives to foster a culture of security awareness and responsibility among our workforce,
including responsibility for reporting suspicious activity.
XYZ Inc has a third party supplier risk management program to oversee and identify risks from
cybersecurity threats associated with its use of third party service providers and vendors. Risks are
assessed and prioritized based, among other things, on the type of offering/engagement, supplier
assessments, threat intelligence, and industry practices.
As discussed in greater detail in Item 1A., "Risk Factors," the company faces numerous and evolving
cybersecurity threats, including risks originating from the increased use of AI, intentional acts of
individual and groups of criminal hackers, hacktivists, state-sponsored organizations, nation states
and competitors; from intentional and unintentional acts or omissions of customers, contractors,
business partners, vendors, employees and other third parties; and from errors in processes or
technologies, as well as the risks associated with the number of customers, contractors, business
partners, vendors, employees and other third parties working remotely. While the company continues to
monitor for, identify, investigate, respond to and remediate cybersecurity risks, including incidents
and vulnerabilities, there have not been any that have had a material adverse effect on the company,
though there is no assurance that there will not be cybersecurity risks that will have a material
adverse effect in the future.
Governance
XYZ Inc’s Enterprise & Technology Security (“E&TS”) organization has oversight responsibility for the
security of both XYZ Inc’s internal systems and external offerings and works across all of the
organizations within the company to protect XYZ Inc, its brand, and its clients against cybersecurity
risks. E&TS also addresses cybersecurity risks associated with third party suppliers. For these
purposes, E&TS includes a dedicated Chief Information Security Officer (“CISO”) whose team is
responsible for leading enterprise-wide information security strategy, policy, standards,
architecture, and processes for XYZ Inc’s internal systems. The CISO manages the CSIRT. The CISO also
manages the Product Security Incident Response Team (“PSIRT”), which focuses on product
vulnerabilities potentially affecting the security of offerings sold to customers. XYZ Inc also has
Business Information Security Officers (“BISO”) who are coordinated by the Office of the CISO on
security issues specific to particular business segments.
 10 
The CSIRT team, together with the Office of the Chief Information Officer (“CIO”), Cyber Legal,
Corporate Security, and BISOs, engages in on-going reviews of incidents, threat intelligence,
detections, and vulnerabilities, including to assess client and regulatory impact. Events of interest
are promptly reported to the Senior Vice President (“SVP”) and Chief Legal Officer ("CLO"), and the
SVP overseeing cybersecurity (“SVP Sponsor”).
Incidents are delegated to an appropriate incident response team for assessment, investigation, and
remediation. Depending on the nature of the matter, the incident response team may include
individuals from E&TS, the Office of the CISO, the Office of the CIO, Cyber Legal, Business Units,
the Office of Privacy and Responsible Technology, Human Resources, Procurement, Finance and
Operations, and Corporate Security. The incident response teams advise and consult with the CLO and
the SVP Sponsor, as appropriate.
The Cybersecurity Advisory Committee (“CAC”)meets regularly and is responsible for overseeing
management of the Company’s cybersecurity risk. The CAC is composed of, among others, SVPs from the
major business units, the SVP Sponsor, and the CLO. The CAC is responsible for, among other things,
setting the Company’s governance structure for managing cybersecurity risk and reviewing noteworthy
cybersecurity incidents and strategies to prevent recurrence. XYZ Inc management responsible for managing
cybersecurity risk reflects a cross-section of functions from across the organization with
significant experience in managing such risk as well as the technologies underlying these risks. They
also hold leadership positions outside of XYZ Inc in the field of cybersecurity, serving on governing and
advisory boards of public and private institutions at the forefront of issues related to
cybersecurity, including technology development, cybersecurity policy, and national security.
The Board of Directors and the Audit Committee oversee the cyber governance process. Leadership from
E&TS, including the CISO, make regular presentations to the Audit Committee and the full Board on
identification, management, and remediation of cybersecurity risks, both internal and external, as
well as threat intelligence, emerging global policies and regulations, cybersecurity technologies,
and best practices.In addition, senior management provides briefings as needed to the Audit Committee
Chair, the Audit Committee, and, as appropriate, the full Board, on cybersecurity issues and
incidents of potential interest.
XYZ Inc ’s corporate headquarters are located at an owned site in Armonk, New York. As of December 31,
2024, in aggregate, we owned or leased facilities for current use consisting of approximat ely 41
million square feet worldwide.
At December 31, 2024, XYZ Inc’s facilities in the U.S. had aggregate floor space of approximately 17
million square feet, of which approximately 9 million was owned and 8 million was leased. Outside the
U.S., facilities totaled approximately 24 million square feet, of which 3 million was owned and 21
million was leased. This space is primarily used for sales and distribution, manufacturing and
development, data processing services including the company’s cloud centers, research and other
administrative and general support purposes. Our facilities are utilized for current operations of
all business segments.
Continuous optimization, maintenance and upgrading of facilities are essential to maintain our
technological leadership, improve productivity and meet customer demand. We believe that in all
material respects our properties have been satisfactorily maintained, are in good condition and are
suitable for our operations.

The material features of each equity compensation plan under which equity securities are authorized
for issuance that was adopted without stockholder approval are described below:
 2001 Long-Term Performance Plan (the “2001 Plan”) 
The 2001 Plan has been used to fund awards for employees other than senior executives of the Company.
Awards for senior executives of the Company have been and will continue to be funded from the
stockholder-approved 1999 Long-Term Performance Plan (the “1999 Plan”); the 1999 Plan is also used to
fund awards for employees other than senior executives, otherwise, the provisions of the 2001 Plan
are identical to the 1999 Plan, including the type of awards that may be granted under the plan
(stock options, restricted stock and unit awards and long-term performance incentive awards).
The 2001 Plan is administered by the Executive Compensation and Management Resources Committee of the
Board of Directors (the “Committee”), and that Committee may delegate to officers of the company
certain of its duties, powers and authority. Payment of awards may be made in the form of cash, stock
or combinations thereof and may be deferred with Committee approval. Awards are not transferable or
assignable except (i) by law, will or the laws of descent and distribution, (ii) as a result of the
disability of the recipient, or (iii) with the approval of the Committee.
If the employment of a participant terminates, other than as a result of the death or disability of a
participant, all unexercised, deferred and unpaid awards shall be canceled immediately, unless the
award agreement provides otherwise. In
 15 
the event of the death of a participant or in the event a participant is deemed by the company to be
disabled and eligible for benefits under the terms of the XYZ Inc Long-Term Disability Plan (or any
successor plan or similar plan of another employer), the participant’s estate, beneficiaries or
representative, as the case may be, shall have the rights and duties of the participant under the
applicable award agreement. In addition, unless the award agreement specifies otherwise, the
Committee may cancel, rescind, suspend, withhold or otherwise limit or restrict any unexpired,
unpaid, or deferred award at any time if the participant is not in compliance with all applicable
provisions of the awards agreement and the 2001 Plan. In addition, awards may be cancelled if the
participant engages in any conduct or act determined to be injurious, detrimental or prejudicial to
any interest of the company.
PWCC Acquisition Long-Term Performance Plan (the “PWCC Plan”)
The PWCC Plan was adopted by the Board of Directors in connection with the company’s acquisition of
PricewaterhouseCoopers Consulting (“PwCC”) from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, as announced on October
1, 2002. The PWCC Plan has been and will continue to be used solely to fund awards for employees of
PwCC who have become employed by the company as a result of the acquisition. Awards for senior
executives of the company will not be funded from the PWCC Plan. The terms and conditions of the PWCC
Plan are substantively identical to the terms and conditions of the 2001 Plan, described above.
XYZ Inc Red Hat Acquisition Long-Term Performance Plan (the “Red Hat Plan”)
The Red Hat Plan was adopted by the Board of Directors in connection with the company’s acquisition
of Red Hat, Inc. on July 9, 2019. The Red Hat Plan was used solely to fund awards for employees who
were not employed by XYZ Inc immediately prior to the closing of the acquisition. Awards for senior
executives of the company will not be funded from the Red Hat Plan. The terms and conditions of the
Red Hat Plan are substantively identical to the terms and conditions of the 2001 Plan, described
above.
Amended and Restated Deferred Compensation and Equity Award Plan (the “DCEAP”)
The DCEAP was adopted in 1993 and amended and restated effective January 1, 2014. Under the Amended
and Restated DCEAP, non-management directors receive Promised Fee Shares in connection with deferred
annual retainer payments. Each Promised Fee Share is equal in value to one share of the company’s
common stock. Upon a director’s retirement or other completion of service as a director, amounts
deferred into Promised Fee Shares are payable in either cash and/or shares of the company’s stock
either as lump sum or installments pursuant to the director’s distribution election. For additional
information about the DCEAP, refer to “Director Compensation under the XYZ Inc Deferred Compensation and
Equity Award Plan (DCEAP)” in XYZ Inc’s definitive Proxy Statement to be filed with the SEC and delivered

International Business Machines Corporation (XYZ Inc or the company) was incorporated in the State of New
York on June 16, 1911, as the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Co. (C-T-R), a consolidation of the
Computing Scale Co. of America, the Tabulating Machine Co. and The International Time Recording Co.
of New York. Since that time, XYZ Inc has focused on the intersection of business insight and
technological innovation, and its operations and aims have been international in nature. This was
signaled over 100 years ago, in 1924, when C-T-R changed its name to International Business Machines
Corporation. And it continues today—we create sustained value for clients by helping them leverage
the power of hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence (AI). Our hybrid cloud platform and AI
technology support clients’ digital transformations and helps them reimagine critical workflows, at
scale, and modernize applications to increase agility, drive innovation and create operational
efficiencies. Our offerings draw from leading XYZ Inc capabilities in software, consulting services
capability to deliver business outcomes, and deep incumbency in mission-critical infrastructure, all
bolstered by one of the world’s leading research organizations.

 Strategic Partnerships 
We proactively partner with a broad variety of companies including hyperscalers, service providers,
global system integrators, and software and hardware vendors. We work alongside our partners to
deliver end-to-end solutions that address our clients’ complex business challenges while accelerating
growth. Our strategic partners include: Adobe, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft, Oracle, Palo
Alto Networks, Salesforce, Samsung Electronics and SAP, among others.
Companies with which we have strategic partnerships in some areas may be competitors in other areas.
 Competition 
XYZ Inc is a globally integrated enterprise that participates in a highly competitive environment. Our
competitors vary by industry segment, and range from large multinational enterprises to smaller, more
narrowly focused entities. Across our business segments, we recognize hundreds of competitors
worldwide and as we execute our hybrid cloud and AI strategy, we are regularly exposed to new
competitors.
Our principal methods of competition are: technology innovation; performance; price; quality; brand;
our breadth of capabilities, products and services; talent; client relationships and trust; the
ability to deliver business value to clients; and service and support. In order to maintain
leadership, we optimize our portfolio with organic and inorganic innovations and effective resource
allocation. These investments not only drive current performance but will extend our innovation
leadership into the future.
Our breadth and depth of expertise enables us to take different technologies and bring them together
to solve the most pressing business issues of our clients. We differentiate from other providers by
bringing together incumbency with enterprises, deep expertise in technology, industries and business
processes, a broad go-to-market reach including an ecosystem of partners and alliances, and a strong
focus on innovation. All of these attributes position XYZ Inc for accelerated growth now and prepare us
for the next set of business opportunities, such as quantum computing.
 1 
Overall, the company is the leader or among the leaders in each of our business segments. A summary
of the competitive environment for each business segment is included below:
Software:
The depth, breadth, and innovation of our software offerings, coupled with our global reach, deep
industry expertise and research capabilities help differentiate our offerings from our competitors.
Our hybrid cloud and AI platforms allow clients to realize their digital and AI transformations
across the applications, data, and environments in which they operate. The principal competitors in
this segment include: Alphabet (Google), Amazon, BMC, Broadcom, Informatica, Microsoft, Oracle,
Salesforce, SAP and Splunk. We also compete with smaller, niche competitors in specific geographic
regions or product segments.
Consulting:
Consulting focuses on integrating skills on strategy, experience, technology and operations by domain
and industry. Consulting competes in a dynamic market including consulting, systems integration,
application development, application management and business process outsourcing services. Our broad-
based competitors include: Accenture, Capgemini, India-based service providers, management consulting
firms, the consulting practices of public accounting firms, engineering service providers, and many
companies that primarily focus on local markets or niche service areas.
Infrastructure:
XYZ Inc is well positioned in the growing hybrid cloud infrastructure market, providing on-premises and
cloud-based server and storage solutions. We gain advantage and differentiation through investments
in higher-value capabilities, including security, scalability, and reliability, designed especially
for mission-critical and AI workloads. In addition, we offer a portfolio of life-cycle services for
hybrid cloud infrastructure deployment. Our principal competitors include: Dell Technologies,
Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (HPE), Intel, NetApp and Pure Storage as well as original device

leveraging innovation in technology and service delivery to compete with traditional providers and to
offer additional routes to market for server and storage systems.
Financing:
Financing provides client and commercial financing, facilitating XYZ Inc clients’ acquisition of
hardware, software and services. Financing’s ability to manage credit and residual value risk
generates a competitive advantage for the company. The key competitive factors include: interest
rates charged, IT product experience, client service, contract flexibility, ease of doing business,
global capabilities and residual values. In client and commercial financing, Financing primarily
competes with non-captive financing entities and financial institutions.

 Risks Related to Our Business 
Downturn in Economic Environment and Client Spending Budgets Could Impact the Company’s Business: If
overall demand for XYZ Inc’s products and solutions decreases, whether due to general economic
conditions, or a shift in client buying patterns, the company’s revenue and profit could be impacted.
Failure of Innovation Initiatives Could Impact the Long-Term Success of the Company: XYZ Inc has moved
into areas, including those that incorporate or utilize hybrid cloud, AI and generative AI, quantum
and other disruptive technologies, in which it can differentiate itself through responsible
innovation, by leveraging its investments in R&D and attracting a successful developer ecosystem. If
XYZ Inc is unable to continue its cutting-edge innovation in a highly competitive and rapidly evolving
environment or is unable to commercialize such innovations, expand and scale them with sufficient
speed and versatility or is unable to attract a successful developer ecosystem, the company could
fail in its ongoing efforts to maintain and increase its market share and its profit margins.
Damage to XYZ Inc’s Reputation Could Impact the Company’s Business: XYZ Inc has one of the strongest brand
names in the world, and its brand and overall reputation could be negatively impacted by many
factors, including if the company does not continue to be recognized for its industry leading
technology and solutions and as a hybrid cloud and AI leader. XYZ Inc’s reputation is potentially
susceptible to damage by events such as significant disputes with clients, product defects, internal
control deficiencies, delivery failures, cybersecurity incidents, government investigations or legal
proceedings or actions of current or former clients, directors, employees, competitors, vendors,
alliance partners or joint venture partners. If the
 3 
company’s brand image is tarnished by negative perceptions, its ability to attract and retain
customers, talent and ecosystem partners could be impacted.
Risks from Investing in Growth Opportunities Could Impact the Company’s Business: The company
continues to invest significantly in key strategic areas, including AI and generative AI, to drive
revenue growth and market share gains. Client adoption rates and viable economic models are less
certain in the high-value, highly competitive, and rapidly-growing segments. Additionally, emerging
business and delivery models may unfavorably impact demand and profitability for our other products
or services. If the company does not adequately and timely anticipate and respond to changes in
customer and market preferences, competitive actions, disruptive technologies, emerging business
models and ecosystems, the client demand for our products or services may decline or XYZ Inc’s costs may
increase.
XYZ Inc’s Intellectual Property Portfolio May Not Prevent Competitive Offerings, and XYZ Inc May Not Be Able
to Obtain Necessary Licenses: The company’s patents and other intellectual property may not prevent
competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative to the
company’s, nor can there be any assurance that the resources invested by the company to protect its
intellectual property will be sufficient or that the company’s intellectual property portfolio will
adequately deter misappropriation or improper use of the company’s technology. In addition, the
company may be the target of aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by third parties,
including non-practicing entities. Also, there can be no assurances that XYZ Inc will be able to obtain
from third parties the licenses it needs in the future. The company’s ability to protect its
intellectual property could also be impacted by a lack of effective legal protections as well as
changes to existing laws, legal principles and regulations governing intellectual property, including
the ownership and protection of patents.
Certain of the company’s offerings incorporate or utilize open source and other third-party software
licensed with limited or no warranties, indemnification, or other contractual protections for XYZ Inc.
Further, if open source code that XYZ Inc utilizes is no longer maintained, developed or enhanced by the
relevant community of independent open source software programmers, most of whom we do not employ, we
may be unable to develop new technologies, adequately enhance our existing technologies or meet
customer requirements for innovation, quality and price.
Risks to the Company from Acquisitions, Alliances and Divestitures Include Integration Challenges,
Failure to Achieve Objectives, the Assumption or Retention of Liabilities and Higher Debt Levels: The
company has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions, alliances and divestitures. Such
transactions present significant challenges and risks and there can be no assurances that the company
will manage such transactions successfully, that strategic objectives will be achieved or that
strategic opportunities will be available to the company on acceptable terms or at all. With respect
to acquisitions and alliances, the related risks include the company failing to achieve anticipated
revenue improvements and cost savings, the failure to retain key personnel or strategic relationships
of acquired companies, the assumption of liabilities related to litigation or other legal proceedings
involving the businesses in such transactions, and delays in obtaining, or the failure to obtain,
necessary governmental or regulatory approvals, as well as the failure to close planned transactions.
Such transactions may require the company to secure financing and any significant disruption or
turmoil in the capital markets could have an adverse effect on XYZ Inc’s ability to access the capital
markets at favorable terms. From time to time, the company divests or attempts to divest assets that
are no longer central to its strategic objectives. Any such transaction is subject to risks,
including risks related to the terms and timing of such divestitures, risks related to retained
liabilities not subject to the company’s control, and delays in obtaining, or failing to obtain,
necessary governmental or regulatory approvals, as well as the failure to close planned transactions.
The Company’s Financial Results for Particular Periods Are Difficult to Predict: XYZ Inc’s revenues and
profitability are affected by such factors as the introduction of new products and services, the
ability to compete effectively in increasingly competitive marketplaces, the length of the sales
cycles and the seasonality of technology purchases. In addition, certain of the company’s growth
areas involve new products, new customers, new and evolving competitors, and new markets, all of
which contribute to the difficulty of predicting the company’s financial results. The company’s
financial results may also be impacted by the structure of products and services contracts and the
nature of its customers’ businesses; for example, certain of the company’s services contracts with
commercial customers in regulated industries are subject to periodic review by regulators with
respect to controls and processes. Further, general economic conditions, including sudden shifts in
regional or global economic activity may impact the company’s financial results in any particular
period. As a result of the above-mentioned factors, the company’s financial results are difficult to
predict. Historically, the company has had lower revenue in the first quarter than in the immediately
preceding fourth quarter. In addition, the high volume of products typically ordered at the end of
each quarter, especially at the end of the fourth quarter, make financial results for a given period
difficult to predict.
 4 
Due to the Company’s Global Presence, Its Business and Operations Could Be Impacted by Local Legal,
Economic, Political, Health and Other Conditions: The company is a globally integrated entity, doing
business in over 175 countries worldwide and deriving about sixty percent of its revenues from sales
outside the United States. Changes in the laws or policies of the countries in which the company
operates, or inadequate development or enforcement of such laws or policies, could affect the
company’s business and the company’s overall results of operations. Further, the company may be
impacted directly or indirectly by the development and enforcement of laws and regulations in the
U.S. and globally that are specifically targeted at the technology industry. The company’s results of
operations also could be affected by economic and political changes in those countries and by
macroeconomic changes, including recessions, inflation, currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar
and non-U.S. currencies, capital controls, and adverse changes in trade relationships amongst those
countries. Further, as the company expands its customer base and the scope of its offerings, both
within the U.S. and globally, it may be impacted by additional regulatory or other risks, including,
compliance with U.S. and foreign data privacy requirements, outbound investment restrictions, AI and
cloud regulations, data localization requirements, labor relations laws, enforcement of IP protection
laws, laws relating to anti-corruption, anti-competition regulations, and import, export and trade
restrictions. Further, international trade disputes could create uncertainty. Tariffs and
international trade sanctions resulting from these disputes could affect the company’s ability to
move goods and services across borders, or could impose added costs to those activities. Measures
taken to date by the company to mitigate these impacts could be made less effective should trade
sanctions or tariffs change. In addition, any widespread outbreak of an illness, pandemic or other
local or global health issue, natural disasters, climate change impacts, or uncertain political
climates, international hostilities, or any terrorist activities, could adversely affect customer
demand, the company’s operations and supply chain, and its ability to source and deliver products and
services to its customers.
The Company May Not Meet Its Growth and Productivity Objectives: On an ongoing basis, XYZ Inc seeks to
drive greater agility, productivity, flexibility and cost savings by continuously transforming with
the use of automation, AI, agile processes and changes to the ways of working, while also enabling
the scaling of resources, offerings and investments through the company’s globally integrated model
across both emerging and more established markets. These various initiatives may not yield their
intended gains in speed, quality, productivity and enablement of rapid scaling, which may impact the
company’s competitiveness and its ability to meet its growth and productivity objectives.
Ineffective Internal Controls Could Impact the Company’s Business and Operating Results: The
company’s internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because
of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, failure or interruption of
information technology systems, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Even effective
internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair
presentation of financial statements. If the company fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal
controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if the company
experiences difficulties in their implementation, the company’s business and operating results could
be harmed and the company could fail to meet its financial reporting obligations.
The Company’s Use of Accounting Estimates Involves Judgment and Could Impact the Company’s Financial
Results: The application of accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP) requires the
company to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect
its reported financial condition. The company’s most critical accounting estimates are described in
the Management Discussion in XYZ Inc’s 2024 Annual Report to Stockholders, under “Critical Accounting
Estimates.” In addition, as discussed in note Q, “Commitments & Contingencies,” in XYZ Inc’s 2024 Annual
Report to Stockholders, the company makes certain estimates including decisions related to legal
proceedings and reserves. These estimates and assumptions involve the use of judgment. As a result,
actual financial results may differ.
The Company’s Goodwill or Amortizable Intangible Assets May Become Impaired: The company acquires
other companies, including the intangible assets of those companies. The company may not realize all
the economic benefit from those acquisitions, which could cause an impairment of goodwill or
intangible assets. If our goodwill or net intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to
record a charge to the Consolidated Income Statement.
The Company Depends on Skilled Employees and Could Be Impacted by a Shortage of Critical Skills: Much
of the future success of the company depends on the continued service, availability and integrity of
skilled employees, including technical, marketing and staff resources. Skilled and experienced
personnel in the areas where the company competes are in high demand, and competition for their
talents is intense. Changing demographics and labor work force trends may result in a shortage of or
insufficient knowledge and skills. In addition, as global opportunities and industry demand shifts,
realignment, training and scaling of skilled resources may not be sufficiently rapid or successful.
Further, many of XYZ Inc’s key employees receive a total compensation package that includes equity
awards. Any new regulations, volatility in the
 5 
stock market and other factors could diminish the company’s use or the value of the company’s equity
awards, putting the company at a competitive disadvantage.
The Company’s Business Could Be Impacted by Its Relationships with Critical Suppliers: XYZ Inc’s business
employs a wide variety of components (hardware and software), supplies, services and raw materials
from a substantial number of suppliers around the world. Certain of the company’s businesses rely on
a single or a limited number of suppliers, including for server processor technology for certain
semiconductors. Changes in the business condition (financial or otherwise) of these suppliers could
subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring products to market. Further, the
failure of the company’s suppliers to deliver components, supplies, services and raw materials in
sufficient quantities, in a timely or secure manner, and in compliance with all applicable laws and
regulations could adversely affect the company’s business. In addition, any defective components,
supplies or materials, or inadequate services received from suppliers could reduce the reliability of
the company’s products and services and harm the company’s reputation.
Product and Service Quality Issues Could Impact the Company’s Business and Operating Results: The
company has rigorous quality control standards and governance processes intended to prevent, detect
and correct errors, malfunctions and other defects in its products and services. If errors,
malfunctions, defects or disruptions in service are experienced by customers or in the company’s
operations there could be negative consequences that could impact customers’ business operations and
harm the company’s business’s operating results.
The Development and Use of AI and Generative AI, including the Company’s Increased Offerings and Use
of AI-based Technologies, Could Impact the Long-Term Success of the Company and its Reputation or
Give Rise to Legal or Regulatory Action: XYZ Inc is increasingly applying AI-based technologies,
including generative AI, to its services and products, to how it delivers offerings to XYZ Inc clients,
and to its own internal operations. Additionally, XYZ Inc is investing in and offering new products and
services associated with AI development, deployment and management. As stated more comprehensively
and in context of several risk factors throughout this Item 1A., this increasing mix and application
of AI-based technologies may impact XYZ Inc’s ongoing efforts to maintain and increase its market share
and its profit margins or harm XYZ Inc’s reputation if the company does not continue to be recognized as
an AI leader with strong governance processes. XYZ Inc’s drive for greater agility, productivity,
flexibility and cost savings by continuously transforming with the use of AI may not yield intended
gains in speed, quality, productivity and enablement of rapid scaling, which may impact the company’s
competitiveness. The evolving global AI regulatory environment, including the enactment of the EU AI
Act, may affect the company’s business and the company’s overall results of operations. Computer
hackers and others routinely attack the security of technology products, services, systems and
networks using a wide variety of methods, and the increased use of generative AI may introduce novel
methods of attack. In the event of such actions, the company, its customers and other third parties
could be exposed to liability, litigation, and regulatory or other government action, including
debarment, as well as the loss of existing or potential customers, damage to brand and reputation,
damage to XYZ Inc’s competitive position, and other financial loss.
The Company Could Be Impacted by Its Business with Government Clients: The company’s customers
include numerous governmental entities within and outside the U.S., including the U.S. Federal
Government and state and local entities. Some of the company’s agreements with these customers may be
subject to periodic funding approval. Funding reductions, delays or work stoppages could adversely
impact public sector demand for our products and services. Also, some agreements may contain
provisions allowing the customer to terminate without cause and providing for higher liability limits
for certain losses. In addition, the company could be suspended or debarred as a governmental
contractor and could incur civil and criminal fines and penalties, which could negatively impact the
company’s results of operations, financial results and reputation.
The Company’s Reliance on Third-Party Distribution Channels and Ecosystems Could Impact Its Business:
The company offers its products directly and through a variety of third-party distributors,
resellers, independent software vendors, independent service providers, and other ecosystem partners.
Changes in the business condition (financial or otherwise) of these ecosystem partners could subject
the company to losses and affect its ability to bring its products to market. As the company moves
into new areas, ecosystem partners may be unable to keep up with changes in technology and offerings,
and the company may be unable to recruit and enable appropriate partners to achieve anticipated
ecosystem growth objectives. In addition, the failure of ecosystem partners to comply with all
applicable laws and regulations may prevent the company from working with them and could subject the
company to losses and affect its ability to bring products to market.
 6 
Cybersecurity, Privacy, and AI Considerations Could Impact the Company’s Business: There are numerous
and evolving risks to cybersecurity and privacy, including risks originating from intentional acts of
individual and groups of criminal hackers, hacktivists, state-sponsored organizations, nation states
and competitors; from intentional and unintentional acts or omissions of customers, contractors,
business partners, vendors, employees and other third parties; and from errors in processes or
technologies, as well as the risks associated with an increase in the number of customers,
contractors, business partners, vendors, employees and other third parties working remotely. Computer
hackers and others routinely attack the security of technology products, services, systems and
networks, like those we offer, using a wide variety of methods, including ransomware or other
malicious software and attempts to exploit vulnerabilities in hardware, software, and infrastructure,
and the increased use of generative AI may introduce novel methods of attack. Attacks also include
social engineering and cyber extortion to induce customers, contractors, business partners, vendors,
employees and other third parties to disclose information, transfer funds, or unwittingly provide
access to systems or data. The company is at risk of security breaches not only of our own products,
services, systems and networks, but also those of customers, contractors, business partners, vendors,
employees and other third parties, particularly as all parties increasingly digitize their
operations. Cyber threats are increasing in number and sophistication, continually evolving,
including with the increased use of AI, making it difficult to anticipate and defend against such
threats and vulnerabilities that can persist undetected over extended periods of time.
The company’s products, services, systems and networks, including cloud-based systems and systems and
technologies that the company maintains on behalf of its customers, are used in critical company,
customer or third-party operations, and involve the storage, processing and transmission of sensitive
data, including valuable intellectual property, other proprietary or confidential data, regulated
data, and personal information of employees, customers and others. These products, services, systems
and networks are also used by customers in heavily regulated industries, including those in the
financial services, healthcare, critical infrastructure and government sectors.
As is common in our industry and for a company our size, we continue to face and prepare for
cybersecurity threats. While the company continues to monitor for, identify, investigate, respond to
and remediate a wide range of cybersecurity events, there have not been cybersecurity incidents or
vulnerabilities that have had a material adverse effect on the company, though there is no assurance
that there will not be cybersecurity incidents or vulnerabilities that will have a material adverse
effect in the future.
The company regularly addresses cybersecurity attacks and vulnerabilities. Cybersecurity attacks or
other security incidents, including industry-wide incidents such as MOVEit, have or could result in,
for example, one or more of the following: unauthorized access to, disclosure, modification, misuse,
loss, or destruction of company, customer, or other third-party data or systems; theft or import or
export of sensitive, regulated, or confidential data including personal information and intellectual
property, including key innovations in AI, quantum, or other disruptive technologies; the loss of
access to critical data or systems through ransomware, crypto mining, destructive attacks or other
means; and business delays, service or system disruptions or denials of service.
In the event of such actions, the company, its customers and other third parties could be exposed to
liability, litigation, and regulatory or other government action, including debarment, as well as the
loss of existing or potential customers, damage to brand and reputation, damage to our competitive
position, and other financial loss. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of responding
to cybersecurity incidents and implementing remediation measures could be significant. In the
company’s industry, security vulnerabilities are increasingly discovered, publicized and exploited
across a broad range of hardware, software or other infrastructure, including in our own products,
services, systems and networks, or third-party data and systems upon which we rely, elevating the
risk of attacks and the potential cost of response and remediation for the company and its customers.
In addition, the fast-paced, evolving, pervasive, and sophisticated nature of certain cyber threats
and vulnerabilities, as well as the scale and complexity of the business and infrastructure, make it
possible that certain threats or vulnerabilities will be undetected or unmitigated in time to prevent
or minimize the impact of an attack on the company or its customers.
Cybersecurity risk to the company and its customers also depends on factors such as the actions,
practices and investments of customers, contractors, business partners, vendors, the open source
community and other third parties, including, for example, providing and implementing patches to
address vulnerabilities. Cybersecurity attacks or other catastrophic events resulting in disruptions
to or failures in power, information technology, communication systems or other critical
infrastructure could result in interruptions or delays to company, customer, or other third-party
operations or services, financial loss, injury or death to persons or property, potential liability,
and damage to brand and reputation.
 7 
Although the company continuously takes significant steps to mitigate cybersecurity risk across a
range of functions, such measures can never eliminate the risk entirely or provide absolute security.
As a global enterprise, the regulatory environment with regard to cybersecurity, privacy, AI and data
protection issues is increasingly complex and will continue to impact the company’s business,
including through increased risk, increased costs, and expanded or otherwise altered compliance
obligations, including with respect to the increased regulatory activity around the security of
critical infrastructure, IoT devices, customer industries (e.g., financial services) and various
customer and government supply chain security programs. As the reliance on data grows for the company
and our clients, the potential impact of regulations on the company’s business, risks, and reputation
will grow accordingly. The enactment and expansion of cybersecurity, AI, data protection and privacy
laws, regulations and standards around the globe will continue to result in increased compliance
costs, including due to an increased focus on international data transfer mechanisms and data
location; increased cybersecurity requirements and reporting obligations; the lack of harmonization
of such laws and regulations; the increase in associated litigation and enforcement activity by
governments and private parties; the potential for damages, fines and penalties and debarment; and
the potential regulation of new and emerging technologies. Any additional costs and penalties
associated with increased compliance, enforcement, and risk reduction could make certain offerings
less profitable or increase the difficulty of bringing certain offerings to market or maintaining
certain offerings.
 Risks Related to Laws and Regulations 
The Company Could Incur Substantial Costs Related to Climate Change and Other Environmental Matters:
XYZ Inc, like other companies, is subject to potential climate-related risks and costs such as those
resulting from increased severe weather events, prolonged changes in temperature, new regulations
affecting hardware products and data centers, carbon taxes, and increased environmental disclosures
requested or required by clients, regulators and others. The company is also subject to various
federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the
environment or otherwise related to environmental protection, including the U.S. Superfund law. The
company could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal
sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, if it were to
violate or become liable under environmental laws and regulations. We do not expect climate change or
compliance with environmental laws and regulations focused on climate change to have a
disproportionate effect on the company or its financial position, results of operations and
competitive position.
Tax Matters Could Impact the Company’s Results of Operations and Financial Condition: The company is
subject to income taxes in both the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. XYZ Inc’s provision
for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors
including, but not limited to, income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with
lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates,
changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in tax laws,
regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof, which could adversely impact the
company’s results of operations and financial condition in future periods. The Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has issued model rules for a new global minimum tax.
Local country adoption of these rules may increase tax uncertainty and may adversely impact the
company’s income taxes. Furthermore, local country, state, provincial or municipal taxation may also
be subject to review and potential override by regional, federal, national or similar forms of
government. In addition, XYZ Inc is subject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by
the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities around the world. The
company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to
determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes
from these examinations will not have an adverse effect on the company’s provision for income taxes
and cash tax liability.
The Company Is Subject to Legal Proceedings and Investigatory Risks: As a company with a substantial
employee population and with clients in more than 175 countries, XYZ Inc is or may become involved as a
party and/or may be subject to a variety of claims, demands, suits, investigations, tax matters and
other proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of its business. The risks
associated with such legal proceedings are described in more detail in note Q, “Commitments &
Contingencies,” in XYZ Inc’s 2024 Annual Report to Stockholders. The company believes it has adopted
appropriate risk management and compliance programs. Legal and compliance risks, however, will
continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies, the outcome of which
cannot be predicted with certainty, may arise from time to time.

Risks Related to Financing and Capital Markets Activities
The Company’s Results of Operations and Financial Condition Could Be Negatively Impacted by Its U.S.
and non-U.S. Pension Plans: Adverse financial market conditions and volatility in the credit markets
may have an unfavorable impact on the value of the company’s pension trust assets and its future
estimated pension liabilities. As a result, the company’s financial results in any period could be
negatively impacted. In addition, in a period of an extended financial market downturn, the company
could be required to provide incremental pension plan funding with resulting liquidity risk which
could negatively impact the company’s financial flexibility. Further, the company’s results could be
negatively impacted by premiums for mandatory pension insolvency insurance coverage outside the
United States. Premium increases could be significant due to the level of insolvencies of unrelated
companies in the country at issue. XYZ Inc’s 2024 Annual Report to Stockholders includes information
about potential impacts from pension funding and the use of certain assumptions regarding pension
matters.
The Company Is Exposed to Currency and Financing Risks That Could Impact Its Revenue and Business:
The company derives a significant percentage of its revenues and costs from its affiliates operating
in local currency environments, and those results are affected by changes in the relative values of
non-U.S. currencies and the U.S. dollar, as well as sudden shifts in regional or global economic
activity. Further, inherent in the company’s financing business are risks related to the
concentration of credit, client creditworthiness, interest rate and currency fluctuations on the
associated debt and liabilities and the determination of residual values. The company employs a
number of strategies to manage these risks, including the use of derivative financial instruments,
which involve the risk of non-performance by the counterparty. In addition, there can be no assurance
that the company’s efforts to manage its currency and financing risks will be successful.
The Company’s Financial Performance Could Be Impacted by Changes in Market Liquidity Conditions and
by Customer Credit Risk on Receivables: The company’s financial performance is exposed to a wide
variety of industry sector dynamics worldwide, including sudden shifts in regional or global economic
activity. The company’s earnings and cash flows, as well as its access to funding, could be
negatively impacted by changes in market liquidity conditions. XYZ Inc’s 2024 Annual Report to
Stockholders includes information about the company’s liquidity position. The company’s client base
includes many enterprises worldwide, from small and medium businesses to the world’s largest
organizations and governments, with a significant portion of the company’s revenue coming from global
clients across many sectors. Most of the company’s sales are on an open credit basis, and the company
performs ongoing credit evaluations of its clients’ financial conditions. If the company becomes
aware of information related to the creditworthiness of a major customer, or if future actual default
rates on receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the company may have to
adjust its allowance for credit losses, which could affect the company’s consolidated net income in
the period the adjustments are made.
 Risks Related to Ownership of XYZ Inc Securities 
Risk Factors Related to XYZ Inc Securities: The company and its subsidiaries issue debt securities in the
worldwide capital markets from time to time, with a variety of different maturities and in different
currencies. The value of the company’s debt securities fluctuates based on many factors, including
the methods employed for calculating principal and interest, the maturity of the securities, the
aggregate principal amount of securities outstanding, the redemption features for the securities, the
level, direction and volatility of interest rates, changes in exchange rates, exchange controls,
governmental and stock exchange regulations and other factors over which the company has little or no
control. The company’s ability to pay interest and repay the principal for its debt securities is
dependent upon its ability to manage its business operations, as well as the other risks described
under this Item 1A. entitled “Risk Factors.” There can be no assurance that the company will be able
to manage any of these risks successfully.
The company also issues its common stock from time to time in connection with various compensation
plans, contributions to its pension plan and certain acquisitions. The market price of XYZ Inc common
stock is subject to significant volatility, due to other factors described under this Item 1A.
entitled “Risk Factors,” as well as economic and geopolitical conditions generally, trading volumes,
speculation by the press or investment community about the company’s financial condition, and other
factors, many of which are beyond the company’s control. Since the market price of XYZ Inc’s common stock
fluctuates significantly, stockholders may not be able to sell the company’s stock at attractive
prices.
In addition, changes by any rating agency to the company’s outlook or credit ratings can negatively
impact the value and liquidity of both the company’s debt and equity securities. The company does not
make a market in either its debt or equity securities and cannot provide any assurances with respect
to the liquidity or value of suchsecurities.

Risk Management and Strategy
Cybersecurity is a critical part of risk management at XYZ Inc and is integrated with the company’s
overall enterprise risk management framework.The Board of Directors and the Audit Committee of the
Board are responsible for overseeing management’s execution of cybersecurity risk management and for
assessing XYZ Inc’s approach to risk management. Senior management is responsible for assessing and
managing XYZ Inc’s exposure to cybersecurity risks on an ongoing basis.
From an enterprise perspective, we implement a multi-faceted risk management approach based on the
National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework. We have established policies
and procedures that provide the foundation upon which XYZ Inc’s infrastructure and data are managed. We
regularly assess and adjust our technical controls and methods to identify and mitigate emerging
cybersecurity risks. We use a layered approach with overlapping controls to defend against
cybersecurity attacks and threats on XYZ Inc networks, end-user devices, servers, applications, data, and
cloud solutions.
We draw heavily on our own commercial security solutions and services to manage and mitigate
cybersecurity risks. XYZ Inc maintains a Security Operations Center (“SOC”) that monitors for threats to
XYZ Inc’s networks and systems, utilizing threat intelligence provided by a range of sources, including
the XYZ Inc Security X-Force Exchange platform, which maintains one of the largest compilations of threat
intelligence in the world. We also rely on tools licensed from third party security vendors to
monitor and manage cybersecurity risks. We periodically engage third parties to supplement and review
our cybersecurity practices and provide relevant certifications.
We have a global incident response process, managed by XYZ Inc’s Computer Security Incident Response Team
(“CSIRT”), that relies primarily on internal expertise to respond to cybersecurity threats and
attacks. We utilize a combination of online training, educational tools, videos and other awareness
initiatives to foster a culture of security awareness and responsibility among our workforce,
including responsibility for reporting suspicious activity.
XYZ Inc has a third party supplier risk management program to oversee and identify risks from
cybersecurity threats associated with its use of third party service providers and vendors. Risks are
assessed and prioritized based, among other things, on the type of offering/engagement, supplier
assessments, threat intelligence, and industry practices.
As discussed in greater detail in Item 1A., "Risk Factors," the company faces numerous and evolving
cybersecurity threats, including risks originating from the increased use of AI, intentional acts of
individual and groups of criminal hackers, hacktivists, state-sponsored organizations, nation states
and competitors; from intentional and unintentional acts or omissions of customers, contractors,
business partners, vendors, employees and other third parties; and from errors in processes or
technologies, as well as the risks associated with the number of customers, contractors, business
partners, vendors, employees and other third parties working remotely. While the company continues to
monitor for, identify, investigate, respond to and remediate cybersecurity risks, including incidents
and vulnerabilities, there have not been any that have had a material adverse effect on the company,
though there is no assurance that there will not be cybersecurity risks that will have a material
adverse effect in the future.
Governance
XYZ Inc’s Enterprise & Technology Security (“E&TS”) organization has oversight responsibility for the
security of both XYZ Inc’s internal systems and external offerings and works across all of the
organizations within the company to protect XYZ Inc, its brand, and its clients against cybersecurity
risks. E&TS also addresses cybersecurity risks associated with third party suppliers. For these
purposes, E&TS includes a dedicated Chief Information Security Officer (“CISO”) whose team is
responsible for leading enterprise-wide information security strategy, policy, standards,
architecture, and processes for XYZ Inc’s internal systems. The CISO manages the CSIRT. The CISO also
manages the Product Security Incident Response Team (“PSIRT”), which focuses on product
vulnerabilities potentially affecting the security of offerings sold to customers. XYZ Inc also has
Business Information Security Officers (“BISO”) who are coordinated by the Office of the CISO on
security issues specific to particular business segments.
 10 
The CSIRT team, together with the Office of the Chief Information Officer (“CIO”), Cyber Legal,
Corporate Security, and BISOs, engages in on-going reviews of incidents, threat intelligence,
detections, and vulnerabilities, including to assess client and regulatory impact. Events of interest
are promptly reported to the Senior Vice President (“SVP”) and Chief Legal Officer ("CLO"), and the
SVP overseeing cybersecurity (“SVP Sponsor”).
Incidents are delegated to an appropriate incident response team for assessment, investigation, and
remediation. Depending on the nature of the matter, the incident response team may include
individuals from E&TS, the Office of the CISO, the Office of the CIO, Cyber Legal, Business Units,
the Office of Privacy and Responsible Technology, Human Resources, Procurement, Finance and
Operations, and Corporate Security. The incident response teams advise and consult with the CLO and
the SVP Sponsor, as appropriate.
The Cybersecurity Advisory Committee (“CAC”)meets regularly and is responsible for overseeing
management of the Company’s cybersecurity risk. The CAC is composed of, among others, SVPs from the
major business units, the SVP Sponsor, and the CLO. The CAC is responsible for, among other things,
setting the Company’s governance structure for managing cybersecurity risk and reviewing noteworthy
cybersecurity incidents and strategies to prevent recurrence. XYZ Inc management responsible for managing
cybersecurity risk reflects a cross-section of functions from across the organization with
significant experience in managing such risk as well as the technologies underlying these risks. They
also hold leadership positions outside of XYZ Inc in the field of cybersecurity, serving on governing and
advisory boards of public and private institutions at the forefront of issues related to
cybersecurity, including technology development, cybersecurity policy, and national security.
The Board of Directors and the Audit Committee oversee the cyber governance process. Leadership from
E&TS, including the CISO, make regular presentations to the Audit Committee and the full Board on
identification, management, and remediation of cybersecurity risks, both internal and external, as
well as threat intelligence, emerging global policies and regulations, cybersecurity technologies,
and best practices.In addition, senior management provides briefings as needed to the Audit Committee
Chair, the Audit Committee, and, as appropriate, the full Board, on cybersecurity issues and
incidents of potential interest.
XYZ Inc ’s corporate headquarters are located at an owned site in Armonk, New York. As of December 31,
2024, in aggregate, we owned or leased facilities for current use consisting of approximat ely 41
million square feet worldwide.
At December 31, 2024, XYZ Inc’s facilities in the U.S. had aggregate floor space of approximately 17
million square feet, of which approximately 9 million was owned and 8 million was leased. Outside the
U.S., facilities totaled approximately 24 million square feet, of which 3 million was owned and 21
million was leased. This space is primarily used for sales and distribution, manufacturing and
development, data processing services including the company’s cloud centers, research and other
administrative and general support purposes. Our facilities are utilized for current operations of
all business segments.
Continuous optimization, maintenance and upgrading of facilities are essential to maintain our
technological leadership, improve productivity and meet customer demand. We believe that in all
material respects our properties have been satisfactorily maintained, are in good condition and are
suitable for our operations.

The material features of each equity compensation plan under which equity securities are authorized
for issuance that was adopted without stockholder approval are described below:
 2001 Long-Term Performance Plan (the “2001 Plan”) 
The 2001 Plan has been used to fund awards for employees other than senior executives of the Company.
Awards for senior executives of the Company have been and will continue to be funded from the
stockholder-approved 1999 Long-Term Performance Plan (the “1999 Plan”); the 1999 Plan is also used to
fund awards for employees other than senior executives, otherwise, the provisions of the 2001 Plan
are identical to the 1999 Plan, including the type of awards that may be granted under the plan
(stock options, restricted stock and unit awards and long-term performance incentive awards).
The 2001 Plan is administered by the Executive Compensation and Management Resources Committee of the
Board of Directors (the “Committee”), and that Committee may delegate to officers of the company
certain of its duties, powers and authority. Payment of awards may be made in the form of cash, stock
or combinations thereof and may be deferred with Committee approval. Awards are not transferable or
assignable except (i) by law, will or the laws of descent and distribution, (ii) as a result of the
disability of the recipient, or (iii) with the approval of the Committee.
If the employment of a participant terminates, other than as a result of the death or disability of a
participant, all unexercised, deferred and unpaid awards shall be canceled immediately, unless the
award agreement provides otherwise. In
 15 
the event of the death of a participant or in the event a participant is deemed by the company to be
disabled and eligible for benefits under the terms of the XYZ Inc Long-Term Disability Plan (or any
successor plan or similar plan of another employer), the participant’s estate, beneficiaries or
representative, as the case may be, shall have the rights and duties of the participant under the
applicable award agreement. In addition, unless the award agreement specifies otherwise, the
Committee may cancel, rescind, suspend, withhold or otherwise limit or restrict any unexpired,
unpaid, or deferred award at any time if the participant is not in compliance with all applicable
provisions of the awards agreement and the 2001 Plan. In addition, awards may be cancelled if the
participant engages in any conduct or act determined to be injurious, detrimental or prejudicial to
any interest of the company.
PWCC Acquisition Long-Term Performance Plan (the “PWCC Plan”)
The PWCC Plan was adopted by the Board of Directors in connection with the company’s acquisition of
PricewaterhouseCoopers Consulting (“PwCC”) from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, as announced on October
1, 2002. The PWCC Plan has been and will continue to be used solely to fund awards for employees of
PwCC who have become employed by the company as a result of the acquisition. Awards for senior
executives of the company will not be funded from the PWCC Plan. The terms and conditions of the PWCC
Plan are substantively identical to the terms and conditions of the 2001 Plan, described above.
XYZ Inc Red Hat Acquisition Long-Term Performance Plan (the “Red Hat Plan”)
The Red Hat Plan was adopted by the Board of Directors in connection with the company’s acquisition
of Red Hat, Inc. on July 9, 2019. The Red Hat Plan was used solely to fund awards for employees who
were not employed by XYZ Inc immediately prior to the closing of the acquisition. Awards for senior
executives of the company will not be funded from the Red Hat Plan. The terms and conditions of the
Red Hat Plan are substantively identical to the terms and conditions of the 2001 Plan, described
above.
Amended and Restated Deferred Compensation and Equity Award Plan (the “DCEAP”)
The DCEAP was adopted in 1993 and amended and restated effective January 1, 2014. Under the Amended
and Restated DCEAP, non-management directors receive Promised Fee Shares in connection with deferred
annual retainer payments. Each Promised Fee Share is equal in value to one share of the company’s
common stock. Upon a director’s retirement or other completion of service as a director, amounts
deferred into Promised Fee Shares are payable in either cash and/or shares of the company’s stock
either as lump sum or installments pursuant to the director’s distribution election. For additional
information about the DCEAP, refer to “Director Compensation under the XYZ Inc Deferred Compensation and
Equity Award Plan (DCEAP)” in XYZ Inc’s definitive Proxy Statement to be filed with the SEC and delivered
