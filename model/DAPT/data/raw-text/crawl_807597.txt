differentiated technology, strategic focus on partner channels, and improving financial profile position it as an interesting player in the communications market. The investment thesis hinges on Ooma's ability to successfully execute its growth strategy in these high-potential segments while continuing to drive bottom-line expansion, capitalizing on the foundation it has built.

Ooma has demonstrated a trajectory of consistent revenue growth, reaching $256.85 million in fiscal year 2025, an 8% increase year-over-year, including strong 13% growth in business subscription and services revenue.
This growth continued into Q1 FY26, with total revenue of $65.0 million, up 4% year-over-year, driven primarily by Ooma Business and AirDial momentum, despite the anticipated impact of IWG seat reductions.

Profitability, while historically challenged by investment for growth, is showing signs of improvement.
The company has incurred net losses since inception, with a net loss of $6.90 million in FY25 and $0.141 million in Q1 FY26.
However, on a non-GAAP basis, net income and adjusted EBITDA have been trending upwards.
Q1 FY26 saw adjusted EBITDA of $6.7 million (10.3% of revenue), a 33% increase year-over-year.
Q4 FY25 achieved a record adjusted EBITDA of $6.9 million (11% of revenue).
This improvement reflects increasing operating leverage, particularly in R&D expenses, as the company focuses on efficiency after significant platform investments.

Gross margins remain healthy, with subscription and services gross margin consistently around 70-72% (70% in Q1 FY26 per 10-Q).

gross margin is negative, improving to -42% in Q1 FY26 as higher-cost components are consumed. The overall gross margin was 62% in Q1 FY26, slightly up from 61% in the prior year quarter, influenced by the mix of higher-margin subscription revenue and negative product margin.

Liquidity and cash flow generation are notable strengths. Ooma generated $26.6 million in operating cash flow and $20.2 million in free cash flow in FY25, representing significant increases over the prior year. This strong cash generation continued into Q1 FY26, with $3.7 million in operating cash flow and $2.5 million in free cash flow, despite it being a seasonally lower quarter. The company successfully paid off its remaining debt shortly after Q3 FY25, achieving a debt-free balance sheet as of Q1 FY26. This financial health provides flexibility for strategic initiatives, including opportunistic share repurchases (approximately $7.4 million remained authorized as of April 30, 2025) and potential future acquisitions.

Management's outlook for fiscal year 2026 signals continued growth and a significant step up in profitability. For Q2 FY26, Ooma guides for revenue between $65.5 million and $66.1 million and non-GAAP net income between $5.6 million and $5.9 million. Full-year FY26 guidance forecasts total revenue of $267 million to $270 million, representing 4-5% growth over FY25. This includes an expected 5-6% growth in business subscription and services revenue, partially offset by a 1-2% decline in residential subscription revenue. The profitability outlook is particularly strong, with full-year FY26 non-GAAP net income guided between $22.5 million and $23.5 million, and adjusted EBITDA between $28 million and $29 million. At the midpoint, this represents growth of 26% and 21% respectively over FY25. Management anticipates achieving close to 11% adjusted EBITDA margin for FY26, progressing towards a double-digit long-term target. This is underpinned by expected operating leverage, especially in R&D, and the benefit of high subscription gross margins. Key catalysts for achieving this outlook and potentially accelerating growth beyond FY26 include the successful ramp-up of recent large partner wins. The launch of AirDial with Comcast in Q1 FY26 and the planned residential Telo rollout with a top-tier ILEC starting in late Q3 FY25 are significant opportunities. While the pace of revenue contribution from these large partners is difficult to predict in the near term, management is optimistic about their long-term potential, viewing them as validation of Ooma's solutions and channels to access vast customer bases. The ServiceTitan rollout on the 2600Hz platform this fall also represents a substantial future revenue stream. The outlook assumes the anticipated IWG seat reductions are largely completed in Q1 FY26, stabilizing core user trends thereafter. It also factors in approximately $500,000 of estimated tariff impacts for FY26. While management is cautious about the exact timing of revenue acceleration from new partners, the strategic building blocks are in place, and the company is driving towards faster growth, particularly in the second half of FY26 and into FY27.

Despite the positive momentum and strategic positioning, Ooma faces several risks and challenges that could impact its performance and the investment thesis. A key operational challenge is the timing and pace of revenue ramp from large new partners and customers, particularly for AirDial and 2600Hz. These relationships often involve long sales cycles, proof-of-concept phases, and phased rollouts, making precise forecasting difficult. Delays in partner launches or slower-than-anticipated customer conversions could impact near-term revenue growth. The company is exposed to competitive pressures across all its segments. Larger competitors with greater financial resources and brand recognition could intensify pricing pressure or outspend Ooma on marketing and R&D. The fragmented nature of the CPaaS/CCaaS market also presents challenges in gaining significant market share. Regulatory risks are inherent in the communications industry. Changes in FCC or state regulations regarding VoIP services, 911 requirements, USF contributions, call signaling, or telemarketing laws could increase compliance costs, expose Ooma to liabilities, or negatively impact its service offerings and pricing advantage. Evolving data privacy regulations (e.g., CCPA, CPRA, GDPR) also add complexity and compliance costs. Supply chain dependencies, particularly on sole suppliers for certain components and manufacturers in Asia, pose risks of shortages, price increases, or delays, which could impact product availability, costs, and gross margins. Geopolitical events, such as the Russia-Ukraine war, could also affect third-party contractors located in impacted regions. While IWG seat reductions are largely behind the company, there is a risk of some continued churn from this large customer or increased churn across the broader customer base due to macroeconomic conditions, competitive offerings, or dissatisfaction with service or billing. Finally, the ability to effectively manage growth, integrate acquisitions, and attract and retain skilled personnel are ongoing operational challenges that could impact execution and financial performance if not handled effectively.

Ooma is executing a strategic pivot, leveraging its established platform and recent investments to target significant growth opportunities in the evolving communications landscape. By focusing on the high-potential POTS replacement and wholesale platform markets, alongside its core SMB UCaaS and residential segments, the company is building a diversified revenue base. Recent large partner wins with major carriers and enterprises validate this strategy and provide channels for potentially accelerated growth, particularly as these relationships mature. Crucially, Ooma is demonstrating a clear commitment to translating its strong gross margins and operational efficiencies into enhanced profitability. The guidance for fiscal year 2026 signals a meaningful step up in non-GAAP net income and adjusted EBITDA, supported by operating leverage gained from past R&D investments. With a debt-free balance sheet and robust free cash flow generation, Ooma possesses the financial flexibility to pursue its strategic objectives. While challenges remain, including the timing of partner ramps, competitive pressures, and regulatory complexities, Ooma's

Ooma is strategically pivoting to capitalize on significant past investments in its diverse communications platform, focusing on high-growth opportunities in POTS replacement and wholesale services alongside its core SMB UCaaS and residential segments.
Recent large partner wins, including Comcast and a top-tier ILEC for AirDial and Telo, and ServiceTitan for 2600Hz, represent potential catalysts for accelerating revenue growth, particularly in fiscal year 2027 and beyond, though the near-term ramp timing introduces some forecasting caution.
The company is demonstrating improved operating leverage and is committed to driving enhanced profitability, targeting close to 11% adjusted EBITDA margin in fiscal year 2026, supported by high subscription gross margins and managed R&D spend.
Ooma's differentiated technology, including its PureVoice HD quality, robust platform architecture (300+ APIs), and unique AirDial features like Call Alerts, provides a competitive edge, particularly in cost-sensitive SMB and specialized POTS replacement markets.
Strong free cash flow generation ($20.5 million TTM as of Q1 FY26) and a debt-free balance sheet provide financial flexibility for opportunistic share buybacks and strategic investments, positioning Ooma favorably against competitors with higher debt loads or less consistent cash flow.

Ooma, Inc. operates within the dynamic and highly competitive communications services industry, carving out a distinct position by focusing on delivering advanced voice and collaboration solutions through its smart SaaS and unified communications platforms.
The company's journey began with a strong foothold in residential telephony, notably recognized for its high-definition voice quality via the Ooma Telo product.
Over time, Ooma strategically expanded its reach, developing a robust suite of offerings tailored for businesses, ranging from small and medium-sized enterprises (SMBs) to larger organizations and wholesale partners.
This evolution has been marked by both organic innovation and strategic acquisitions.
Key milestones include the introduction of Ooma Office for SMBs, the development of Ooma AirDial as a specialized solution for the burgeoning Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS) replacement market, and the significant acquisitions of OnSIP and 2600Hz.
The 2600Hz acquisition, in particular, has been transformative, bolstering Ooma's platform capabilities and opening doors to wholesale platform services and select Communications Platform as a Service (CPaaS) opportunities.
Today, Ooma structures its business around four core segments: cloud communications for smaller businesses (Ooma Office/Enterprise), POTS replacement (AirDial/Telo), wholesale platform services (2600Hz), and residential telephony (Telo).
This diversified approach positions Ooma to address distinct market needs with tailored solutions, leveraging its foundational technology and expanding partner ecosystem to drive future growth and profitability.
The company believes it has reached a pivotal point where past investments in building these premier solutions can be increasingly leveraged to capitalize on significant market opportunities and translate into enhanced bottom-line performance.

At the heart of Ooma's offering lies its smart SaaS and unified communications platforms, underpinned by proprietary technology designed to deliver high-quality, reliable, and feature-rich communication services.
A foundational element is Ooma's PureVoice HD technology, which aims to provide superior voice quality, a critical factor in both residential and business communications.
While specific quantifiable metrics comparing PureVoice HD's performance against competitors are limited, management consistently highlights it as a key differentiator contributing to customer satisfaction and retention, particularly in the residential segment where Ooma Telo has been rated highly by consumer reports for approximately a decade.
For its business and wholesale platforms, Ooma emphasizes a modern, flexible architecture.
The 2600Hz platform, acquired in late fiscal 2024, is built with over 300 APIs, offering customers and partners significant flexibility to customize and integrate the platform into their own solutions.
This contrasts with older, less adaptable platforms prevalent in the wholesale market, such as BroadSoft and Metaswitch.
This API-rich design is a tangible technological advantage, enabling Ooma to pursue CPaaS-type opportunities, as demonstrated by the ServiceTitan win, where a customer chose 2600Hz over other CPaaS providers.
In the specialized POTS replacement segment, Ooma AirDial incorporates unique features designed for critical applications.
The recent launch of the Call Alerts feature, which notifies customers when AirDial calls are placed, is highlighted as a capability believed to be unique among POTS replacement providers.
This feature is particularly valuable in life safety applications, providing a tangible benefit in reliability and monitoring.
Furthermore, Ooma is developing enhanced remote device management capabilities for AirDial, aiming to make monitoring and operation more extensive for large organizations managing thousands of lines across hundreds of locations.
While specific quantifiable improvements from these remote management features are not detailed, the strategic intent is to enhance usability and differentiation in a market with complex deployment needs.
Ooma's R&D efforts are focused on expanding features and capabilities across its segments.
For Ooma Office, development includes adding more advanced features like call center capabilities and AI integrations to appeal to larger businesses and enhance customer engagement.
The integration of Ooma's turnkey solutions onto the 2600Hz platform is an ongoing R&D initiative aimed at offering more ready-to-use options for wholesale partners.
While specific target metrics or timelines for all R&D initiatives are not provided, the strategic goal is clear: leverage technology to expand the addressable market, enhance the value proposition, and maintain a competitive edge against rivals.
The ability to drive operating leverage while continuing these R&D investments reflects management's view that the core platforms are sufficiently developed to support growth without requiring the same level of investment as in the past.
