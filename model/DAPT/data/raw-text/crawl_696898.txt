The financial results underscore the positive impact of CTS's strategic shift. For the second quarter of 2025, net sales reached $135.3 million, a 4% increase from the prior year. This growth, combined with operational improvements and a favorable sales mix, propelled the adjusted gross margin to 38.7%, a significant expansion from 35.6% in Q2 2024.
This margin improvement is a direct outcome of the diversification strategy, as higher-value products in the diversified markets contribute more favorably to profitability.

Operating earnings for Q2 2025 stood at $22.7 million, a 28% increase year-over-year.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.57, up from $0.54 in Q2 2024.
The company's adjusted EBITDA margin expanded to 23% in Q2 2025, reflecting strong operational execution and the benefits of the changing revenue mix.
While selling, general, and administrative (SGA) expenses increased due to higher depreciation and amortization from the SyQwest acquisition, and interest expense rose due to acquisition-related borrowings, these impacts were managed effectively.

CTS maintains a strong balance sheet, with cash and cash equivalents of $99.4 million at June 30, 2025.
Long-term debt stood at a manageable $88.0 million.
The company generated $43.9 million in operating cash flow in the first half of 2025, demonstrating robust cash generation capabilities.
This liquidity, coupled with a $400 million revolving credit facility (maturing December 2026), provides ample flexibility for working capital, capital expenditures (expected to be around 4% of sales), and strategic acquisitions.

CTS anticipates continued softness in commercial vehicle revenue throughout the year.
Key risks to this outlook include the evolving landscape of trade tariffs and broader geopolitical uncertainties.
While CTS has managed to mitigate the impact on profitability to date through close collaboration with customers and suppliers on cost and price adjustments, potential changes to agreements like USMCA could pose a more significant challenge.
Customer concentration, with Toyota Motor Corporation and Cummins Inc. representing significant portions of net sales, also remains a factor, though CTS is actively broadening its customer base.
The company also monitors environmental liabilities and the potential impacts of new tax legislation like the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

CTS Corporation is executing a well-defined strategy to transform its business mix, shifting towards higher-growth and higher-margin diversified markets.
This strategic rebalancing, powered by proprietary technology and augmented by targeted acquisitions like SyQwest, is demonstrably enhancing the company's financial profile, as evidenced by expanding gross margins and robust cash flow generation.
While the transportation segment presents near-term challenges, CTS's technological leadership and strategic investments in electrification position it for long-term content growth, regardless of drivetrain shifts.
The company's ability to innovate in niche, high-value applications provides a critical competitive moat against larger, more generalized players.
Investors should monitor the continued execution of the diversification strategy, the ramp-up of new products like the eBrake, and the company's agility in managing geopolitical and tariff-related uncertainties.
CTS's commitment to operational rigor and disciplined capital allocation, combined with its technological prowess, suggests a compelling investment thesis.
