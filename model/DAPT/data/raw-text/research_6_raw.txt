Beginners’ Guide to Financial Statements
The Basics
If you can read a nutrition label or a baseball box score, you can learn to read basic financial statements. If you can follow a recipe or apply for a loan, you can learn basic accounting. The basics aren’t difficult and they aren’t rocket science.
This guide is designed to help you gain a basic understanding of how to read financial statements. Just as a CPR class teaches you how to perform the basics of cardiac resuscitation, this guide will explain how to read the basic parts of a financial statement. It will not train you to be an accountant, but it should give you the confidence to be able to look at a set of financial statements and make sense of them.
Let’s begin by looking at what financial statements do.
They show you the money. They show you where a company’s money came from, where it went, and where it is now.
There are four main financial statements. They are: (1) balance sheets; (2) income statements; (3) cash flow statements; and (4) statements of shareholders’ equity. Balance sheets show what a company owns and what it owes at a fixed point in time. Income statements show how much money a company made and spent over a period of time. Cash flow statements show the exchange of money between a company and the outside world over a period of time. The statement of shareholders’ equity shows changes in the interests of the company’s shareholders over time.
Let’s look at each of the first three financial statements in more detail.
Balance Sheets
A balance sheet provides detailed information about a company’s assets, liabilities and shareholders’ equity.
Assets are things that a company owns that have value. This typically means they can either be sold or used by the company to make products or provide services. Assets include physical property, such as plants, trucks, equipment and inventory. It also includes intangible things like trademarks and patents. Cash is an asset. So are investments a company makes.
Liabilities are amounts of money that a company owes. This can include obligations like loans, rent, accounts payable, payroll, taxes, and future goods or services owed to customers.
Shareholders’ equity is also called net worth. It’s the money that would be left if a company sold all of its assets and paid off all its liabilities.
The balance sheet formula:
ASSETS = LIABILITIES + SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY
Assets are generally listed based on how quickly they will be converted into cash. Current assets are expected to convert to cash within one year. Noncurrent assets take longer. Fixed assets are used to operate the business and are not for sale.
Liabilities are listed by due date. Current liabilities are due within one year. Long-term liabilities are due in more than a year.
Shareholders’ equity includes invested stock plus earnings or losses since inception. Companies sometimes pay dividends instead of retaining all earnings.
The balance sheet is a snapshot at the end of a reporting period. It does not show account flows during the period.
Income Statements
An income statement shows revenue earned over a specific time period. It also shows the costs and expenses associated with that revenue. The bottom line usually shows net earnings or losses.
Income statements also report earnings per share (EPS), which shows how much money shareholders would receive if all earnings were distributed.
Income statements are structured like stairs. Start at the top with total sales. Deduct costs and expenses at each step. The bottom shows the company’s net income or loss.
Top line is gross revenues or sales. Next, subtract sales returns and allowances to get net revenues.
Then deduct cost of sales to get gross profit.
Then deduct operating expenses like administrative salaries and marketing. These expenses support operations but aren’t directly tied to production.
Depreciation is also deducted. It spreads the cost of long-term assets over time.
After deducting operating expenses, you get operating profit.
Then adjust for interest income or expense.
After taxes are deducted, you arrive at net income or net loss.
Earnings Per Share or EPS
To calculate EPS, divide total net income by the number of outstanding shares.
Cash Flow Statements
Cash flow statements show inflows and outflows of cash. This tells whether a company generated or used cash.
Cash flow statements show changes over time and use info from the balance sheet and income statement.
Three parts of a cash flow statement:
(1) Operating activities
(2) Investing activities
(3) Financing activities
Operating Activities
This section adjusts net income for non-cash items (like depreciation) and changes in operating assets and liabilities.
Investing Activities
Shows purchases or sales of long-term assets and securities. Buying assets is a cash outflow. Selling investments is a cash inflow.
Financing Activities
Includes raising cash by issuing stocks or bonds and repaying loans.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis provides context for the financial statements. It explains what management sees in the numbers and discusses trends, risks, and future plans.
Financial Statement Ratios and Calculations
	•	Debt-to-equity ratio = Total Liabilities / Shareholders’ Equity
Shows how much debt exists for each dollar of equity.
	•	Inventory turnover ratio = Cost of Sales / Average Inventory
Shows how often inventory is sold and replaced.
	•	Operating margin = Income from Operations / Net Revenues
Shows what percent of sales was profit.
	•	P/E ratio = Price Per Share / Earnings Per Share
Shows how much investors are paying for each dollar of earnings.
	•	Working capital = Current Assets - Current Liabilities
Shows leftover funds after paying short-term liabilities.
Bringing It All Together
The statements are interrelated. Changes in the balance sheet impact income statements. Cash flows add depth to balance sheet and income statement data. No one statement tells the full story. Together, they are powerful tools for investors.
