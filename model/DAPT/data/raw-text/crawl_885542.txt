What is a 409A valuation?
A 409A valuation is a critical component in determining the fair market value (FMV) of your company’s stock options.
It is named after section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), which was introduced in 2004 to regulate the valuation of non-qualified deferred compensation plans.
The purpose of a 409A valuation is to ensure that employees are not granted stock options at a price below fair market value, which would result in tax consequences for both the employee and the company.

Understanding the significance of 409A valuation is one way to accomplish this.
