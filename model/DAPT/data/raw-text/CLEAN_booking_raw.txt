Company Overview
Booking Holdings Inc. provides online travel and restaurant reservations and related services. It operates through six brands: Booking.com, Priceline.com, agoda.com, Rentalcars.com, KAYAK, and OpenTable.

Investment Overview
Booking Holdings is a market leader in the fast-growing online travel industry. Driven by tech advancements, broader internet access, and connected devices, travel bookings have shifted to consumers. As brick-and-mortar agencies decline, online travel agencies are thriving. The global online travel market is expected to grow from USD475b in 2022 to USD1,009b by 2030 (CAGR 9.88%). Booking Holdings consistently outperforms competitors like Expedia, Airbnb, Trip.com, and TripAdvisor. Booking.com remains the most visited travel website with 563.8m visits—3.5x tripadvisor.com (Jan 2023). Booking Holdings is well-positioned to benefit as a dominant player in a strong growth sector.

BKNG preferred over Expedia. EBITDA margins of 36%-37% in CY25-26 beat Expedia’s 22%. This margin gap reflects differences in regional operations. Expedia focuses on the US, where hotel chains dominate, limiting commission rates. Booking’s presence in Europe allows more pricing power. Entering new regions is feasible for Expedia, but scaling operations is cost-intensive.

Upside capped as the travel recovery peaks and macro headwinds grow. Booking Holdings’ growth metrics are normalizing. Gross booking growth is estimated to slow to 6%/8% in CY25/26, translating to revenue growth of 6%/9% and EBITDA growth of 9%/12%.

We maintain HOLD with a target price of USD4,800 based on 17.5x CY25 EV/EBITDA, near the historical mean. BKNG trades at 16.6x EV/EBITDA, a premium to Expedia’s 6.6x. The premium is justified by higher profitability and a strong European presence. However, the travel rebound has largely played out, and macroeconomic uncertainty may weigh on near-term upside.

Risks
Economic slowdown may affect discretionary travel spending, reducing bookings and pricing power.
Competition is intensifying from both online and traditional travel service providers. Google’s entry into travel booking (Google Hotel Ads, Google Flights, Google Travel) adds pressure.
