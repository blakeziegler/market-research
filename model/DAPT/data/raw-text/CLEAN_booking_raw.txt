Booking Holdings
Time to book in gains
Company Overview
Booking Holdings Inc. is a provider of travel and restaurant online reservation and related
services. The Company offers its services through six consumer-facing brands: Booking.com,
Priceline.com, agoda.com, Rentalcars.com, KAYAK and OPEnTable.
Investment Overview
Market leader of a fast-growing online travel industry. Technological advancements, increasing
internet and device PEnetration, and heightened connectivity has cast the power of travel
bookings into the hands of the consumer. Digitalisation has concurrently hastened the decline
of traditional brick-and-mortar travel agencies whilst advancing the breakthrough of online
travel agencies. According to Research and markets, the global online travel market size is
exPEcted to grow from USD475b in 2022 to USD1,009b in 2030, representing a CAGR of
9.88%. Booking Holdings has consistently booked in higher revenues, above PEers such as
ExPEdia, AirBNB, Trip.com, and Trip Advisor. Booking.com has retained its crown as the most
visited travel and tourism website with 563.8m visits, roughly 3.5x the runner -up,
tripadvisor.com (as at Jan 23). We believe that Booking Holdings is well poised to book in gains
as a dominant player in a thriving industry.
A clear victor arises between the two industry behemoths: preference for BKNG over ExPEdia.
Consensus forecast shows Booking Holdings' EBITDA margins of 36%-37% surpasses
ExPEdia's 22% in CY25-26. We believe that is mainly attributed to the market dynamics of the
key geographies that the players oPErate in. ExPEdia mainly oPErates in the US where large
hotel chains are predominant, resulting in lower bargaining power to charge higher
commission rates. We believe that it is hard for ExPEdia to play catch up with Booking Holdings
as the profitability difference stems from geographic exposure. While it is not hard to venture
into new markets, scaling oPErations require much more investments.
Upside capPEd as travel recovery story has run its course and macro uncertainty creEPS in.
Key oPErational metrics for Booking Holdings such as gross bookings have moderated down
from high double-digit growth rates as travel demand normalises, consistent with commentary
from other online travel agencies. Against a softening demand backdrop, consensus estimates
BKNG's gross booking growth to decelerate to 6%/8% in CY25/26 which should in turn
translate to revenue growth of 6%/9% and EBITDA growth of 9%/12%.
HOLD Booking Holdings with target price USD4,800. Our target price is based on 17.5x CY25
EV/EBITDA which close to the historical mean. BKNG is currently trading at 16.6x EV/EBITDA at
a premium to ExPEdia's EV/EBITDA of 6.6x. We believe that the premium valuation that Booking
Holdings trades at relative to its PEers is justified given its higher profitability and its dominant
position in EuroPE. However, we have a HOLD call on Booking Holdings as we see limited
upside going forward given that the travel recovery story has largely panned out and the near
term could be turbulent due to macROEconomic uncertainty.
Risks
MacROEconomic slowdown. Recession and macro uncertainty may impact discretionary
sPEnding on travel and could negatively impact travel service providers through fewer
bookings and rates.
IntensiFYing comPEtition. Booking Holdings comPEtes with both online and traditional travel
service providers such as ExPEdia. Players such as Google are expanding into the travel
booking space by offering services such as Google Hotel Ads, Google Flights, and Google
Travel, adding comPEtitive pressure to the industry.
