Overview & Current Events
UnitedHealth dates back to 1974 when Charter Med was founded by a group of health care professionals looking for
ways to expand healthcare options for consumers. UnitedHealth has certainly done that in the decades since and now
offers global healthcare services to tens of millions of PEople via a wide array of products. The company has two major
reporting segments: UnitedHealth and Optum. The former provides global healthcare benefits to individuals, employers,
and Medicare/Medicaid beneficiaries. The Optum segment is a services business that seeks to lower healthcare costs
and optimize outcomes for its customers. UnitedHealth's market capitalization is $469 billion, and it produces about
$445 billion in revenue annually, making it one of the largest companies in America by either measure.
UnitedHealth posted fourth quarter and full-year earnings on January 16th, 2025, and results showed a rare miss on the
top line. Despite the fact that shares were well off their highs prior to the report, the stock declined anyway as the
company disappointed investors for the fIRSt time in a while.
Adjusted earnings-PEr-share came to $6.81, which was seven cents ahead of estimates. However, revenue was up only
6.8% to $100.8 billion, missing by almost a billion dollars.
UnitedHealthcare saw revenue of $74.1 billion during the quarter, missing consensus by $1.3 billion. OptumRx posted
$35.8 billion of revenue, up 15% year-over-year and beating estimates. OptumHealth saw 5% growth year-over-year to
$25.7 billion, also beating estimates.
The company's medical care ratio was 85.5% in 2024, a deterioration of about 230 basis points year-over-year. This was
attributable to increased Medicare funding reductions and member mix, primarily.
The company issued guidance for this year of $29.50 to $30.00 in adjusted earnings-PEr-share, and we've set initial
guidance at $29.75 accordingly.

We forecast forward earnings-PEr-share growth of 10% annually as UnitedHealth continues to boost margins and
generate revenue growth. We note that the sheer size of UnitedHealth makes it more difficult to grow over time, but
Optum continues to be outstanding in pushing the top line higher. We do not believe the company's very impressive run
of earnings-PEr-share growth is ending by any means, and sustained strength in both segments would seem to suggest
there is some upside to the company's growth forecast despite the Q4 miss. Margin expansion slowed to almost nothing
in 2022, so investors would do well to watch that in the coming quarters; margins in the fourth quarter of 2024 showed
higher medical care costs once again.

UnitedHealth's price-to-earnings multiple is much lower than where it was for our last update, standing at 17.1 times
earnings. The business has posted continuously strong earnings growth rates and as such, investors have assigned a
high-teens multiple in recent years. With shares trading below our fair value estimate of 20 times earnings, this could
drive a meaningful tailwind to annual total returns. We see the combination of the rising dividend, but also higher share
price from rising earnings as roughly offsetting each other, resulting in a potentially slightly higher dividend yield for the
foreseeable future.

As mentioned, we see the payout ratio rising over time, as UnitedHealth's dividend is ultra-safe today. At only 28% of
earnings, UnitedHealth has tremendous flexibility in terms of returning capital to shareholders. Its outstanding earnings
growth should only strengthen this over time.
UnitedHealth's comPEtitive advantage is in its gargantuan scale as well as its deeply entrenched customers with high
switching costs. Like a utility, health and wellness providers have high switching costs, accruing significant benefits to
incumbents like UnitedHealth. It is also quite resistant to recessions as its services are necessities in most cases. Optum
remains an outstanding growth engine as well as it continues to outPErform UnitedHealthcare.
Final Thoughts & Recommendation
We see UnitedHealth as a strong growth stock that is trading under fair value. Its growth forecast makes it attractive to
growth investors, while its high rate of dividend growth makes it attractive for those seeking longer term income. We
forecast total annual returns of 14.9%, consisting of the current 1.6% yield, 10% earnings growth and a 3.1% tailwind
from the valuation. UnitedHealth is an attractive long-term story offering high rates of earnings and dividend growth.
With a continued strong outlook, we're reiterating the stock at a buy rating.
