Overview & Current Events
UnitedHealth dates back to 1974 when Charter Med was founded by health care professionals seeking to expand options for consumers. UnitedHealth now offers global healthcare services to tens of millions via a wide array of products across two major segments: UnitedHealthcare and Optum. UnitedHealthcare provides global healthcare benefits to individuals, employers, and Medicare/Medicaid beneficiaries. Optum is a services business focused on lowering costs and optimizing outcomes. UnitedHealth’s market capitalization is $469B and annual revenue is about $445B, making it one of America’s largest companies by either measure.
UnitedHealth posted fourth-quarter and full-year results on January 16, 2025. Despite shares being well off their highs, the stock fell as the company missed revenue estimates for the first time in a while. Adjusted EPS was $6.81, seven cents ahead of estimates. Revenue rose 6.8% to $100.8B, missing by nearly $1B. UnitedHealthcare revenue was $74.1B, missing by $1.3B. OptumRx revenue was $35.8B, up 15% year-over-year and above estimates. OptumHealth grew 5% to $25.7B, also ahead of estimates. The medical care ratio was 85.5% in 2024, deteriorating about 230 basis points year-over-year due to Medicare funding reductions and member mix. 2025 adjusted EPS guidance is $29.50 to $30.00; we set $29.75.
Growth on a Per-Share Basis
Year EPS DPS Shares (millions)
2015 $6.01 $1.88 953
2016 $8.05 $2.38 952
2017 $10.07 $2.88 969
2018 $12.19 $3.45 968
2019 $15.11 $4.14 962
2020 $16.88 $4.83 961

2022 $22.19 $6.40 950
2023 $25.12 $7.29 938
2024 $27.66 $8.18 929
2025 $29.75 $8.40 920
2030 $47.91 $16.17 892
We forecast forward EPS growth of 10% annually as UnitedHealth continues to boost margins and drive revenue growth. The company’s size makes growth harder, but Optum remains outstanding in pushing the top line higher. We do not believe the impressive EPS run is ending; sustained strength in both segments suggests upside to the forecast despite the Q4 miss. Margin expansion slowed to almost nothing in 2022, and Q4 2024 reflected higher medical care costs, so margins bear watching.

UnitedHealth’s price-to-earnings multiple is 17.1, well below our fair value estimate of 20. Given the company’s strong growth, a re-rating could be a meaningful tailwind to total returns. We see the rising dividend plus higher earnings largely offsetting each other on yield in the near term, with a potentially slightly higher dividend yield persisting as price and payout grow.

We expect the payout ratio to rise over time; the dividend is ultra-safe today at only 28% of earnings, providing significant flexibility to return capital to shareholders. Outstanding earnings growth should strengthen coverage further. UnitedHealth’s competitive advantage stems from its massive scale and deeply entrenched customer relationships with high switching costs. Like a utility, health and wellness providers face high switching costs, benefiting incumbents such as UnitedHealth. The business is relatively recession resistant given the necessity of its services. Optum remains a standout growth engine alongside UnitedHealthcare.
Final Thoughts and Recommendation
We view UnitedHealth as a strong growth stock trading below fair value. Its growth forecast appeals to growth investors, while its high dividend growth appeals to long-term income investors. We forecast total annual returns of 14.9%, consisting of the 1.6% yield, 10% EPS growth, and a 3.1% valuation tailwind. UnitedHealth remains an attractive long-term story with high rates of earnings and dividend growth. We reiterate Buy.
