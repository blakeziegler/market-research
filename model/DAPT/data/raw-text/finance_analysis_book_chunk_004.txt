understanding balance sheets while the income statement presents a picture of a firm’s economic activities over a period of time, its balance sheet is a snapshot of its financial and physical assets and its liabilities at a point in time. understanding balance sheet accounts, how they are valued, and what they represent is crucial to the financial analysis of a firm. different choices of accounting methods and estimates affect financial ratios, and analysts must make adjustments to compare firms. special attention should be paid to the method used to calculate each item and how balance sheet changes relate to the income statement and equity. more detail on inventories, long-lived assets, deferred taxes, and long-term liabilities is covered in the next study session. the balance sheet (also known as the statement of financial position or condition) reports the firm’s financial position at a point in time and includes assets, liabilities, and equity. assets are resources controlled from past transactions expected to provide future economic benefits. liabilities are obligations from past events expected to require an outflow of economic resources. equity is the residual interest in assets after liabilities, also known as stockholders’ or shareholders’ equity or net assets. an item should be recognized if it is probable it will provide future economic benefits and its cost or value can be measured reliably. the balance sheet helps assess liquidity, solvency, and ability to distribute to shareholders. liquidity is the ability to meet short-term obligations, and solvency is the ability to meet long-term ones. balance sheet elements should not be interpreted as market or intrinsic value. some assets are reported at historical cost, others at amortized cost or fair value. even at fair value, values may have changed since the balance sheet date. some assets or liabilities, like employee value or brand reputation, are not reported. both ifrs and us gaap require separate reporting of current and noncurrent assets and liabilities. this classified balance sheet format helps evaluate liquidity. under ifrs, a liquidity-based format may be used if more relevant, such as in banking. current assets are those likely to be converted to cash or used within a year or operating cycle, whichever is greater. presented by liquidity, current assets show information about operating activities. current liabilities are obligations expected to be settled within a year or operating cycle. criteria for current liabilities include settlement expected during the cycle, within a year, held for trading, or no right to defer settlement for over a year. working capital equals current assets minus current liabilities. too little may indicate liquidity issues; too much may signal inefficient asset use. noncurrent assets and liabilities don’t meet current definitions. noncurrent assets reflect long-term investments; noncurrent liabilities reflect long-term financing. current assets include cash and equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventories, and other current assets. cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments like treasury bills and money market funds, measured at amortized cost or fair value. marketable securities are publicly traded financial assets with determinable value. accounts receivable are amounts owed by customers, reported at net realizable value (gross receivables minus allowance for doubtful accounts). the allowance for doubtful accounts is a contra-asset account. receivables written off reduce both gross receivables and the allowance. disclosures must include credit risk concentrations. analyzing receivables versus sales can reveal collection issues. underestimating bad debt increases reported earnings. inventories include goods for sale or used in manufacturing. manufacturing firms report raw materials, work-in-process, and finished goods. inventory costs include purchase, conversion, and costs to bring inventory to condition and location. excluded costs include abnormal waste, storage (unless part of production), admin overhead, and selling costs. standard costing and retail methods may be used to assign costs. standard costing assigns set material, labor, and overhead amounts. retail method subtracts gross profit from retail prices. cost flow assumptions include fifo, lifo, and average cost. fifo and average are allowed under both ifrs and us gaap. lifo is only allowed under us gaap. under ifrs and gaap (excluding lifo/retail), inventories are reported at the lower of cost or net realizable value (selling price minus completion and disposal costs). under gaap for lifo/retail, inventories are reported at lower of cost or market, with market bounded by replacement cost, net realizable value, and net realizable value minus normal profit. if value falls below carrying value, inventory is written down and a loss is recognized. under ifrs, a subsequent recovery allows a write-up; not allowed under us gaap. other current assets include prepaid expenses and deferred tax assets. prepaid expenses are operating costs paid in advance. as costs incur, they are expensed and the asset is reduced. for example, $400,000 annual rent prepaid reduces cash and increases prepaid rent. after three months, $100,000 is expensed and prepaid rent is reduced. deferred tax assets result from temporary differences between financial and tax reporting income. created when taxes payable exceed income tax expense, often due to timing of expense recognition or tax loss carryforwards. current liabilities include accounts payable, notes payable, accrued liabilities, and unearned revenue. accounts payable are trade payables for goods and services on credit. analyzing payables relative to purchases can signal supplier credit issues. notes payable are promissory note obligations; may also be noncurrent. current portion of long-term debt is principal due within one year or cycle. accrued liabilities are recognized expenses not yet due, e.g., interest payable. firms using accrual accounting recognize interest as incurred. for example, $25,000 interest expense is recognized quarterly even if due year-end. taxes payable are current taxes recognized but unpaid. other examples include wages payable and warranty expenses. unearned revenue is cash received before providing goods/services. increases both cash and liability. as services are delivered, revenue is recognized and liability is reduced. unearned revenue may signal future growth and does not require future cash outflows like accounts payable.
non-current assets property, plant, and equipment (pp&e) are tangible assets used in the production of goods and services. pp&e includes land, buildings, machinery, equipment, furniture, and natural resources. under ifrs, pp&e may be reported using the cost model or the revaluation model. under u.s. gaap, only the cost model is allowed. under the cost model, pp&e (excluding land) is reported at amortized cost, which is historical cost minus accumulated depreciation, amortization, depletion, and impairment losses. land is not depreciated due to its indefinite life. historical cost includes the purchase price plus all costs needed to make the asset ready for use, like delivery and installation. depreciation methods such as straight-line or declining balance allocate the cost to the income statement over time, affecting both the balance sheet and income statement. under the cost model, pp&e must be tested for impairment. an asset is impaired when its carrying value exceeds the recoverable amount, which under ifrs is the higher of fair value minus selling costs or value in use (present value of future cash flows). if impaired, the asset is written down and a loss is recognized. ifrs allows recovery of impairment losses; u.s. gaap does not. under the revaluation model, pp&e is reported at fair value minus depreciation. changes in value affect equity, and sometimes the income statement. under ifrs, investment property is defined as property that earns rental income or appreciates. u.s. gaap does not define investment property separately. under ifrs, investment property can be reported using the cost model or fair value model. changes in fair value under the fair value model are recognized in the income statement. intangible assets are non-monetary assets without physical substance and are not securities. they may be identifiable or unidentifiable. identifiable intangibles include patents, trademarks, and copyrights and can be bought or result from legal rights. unidentifiable intangibles, like goodwill, cannot be bought separately and may have unlimited life. under ifrs, purchased identifiable intangibles can use the cost or revaluation model, though the revaluation model requires an active market. under u.s. gaap, only the cost model is used. internally created intangibles, including most r&d, are expensed under u.s. gaap. under ifrs, research costs are expensed, but development costs can be capitalized if certain criteria are met. finite-lived intangibles are amortized over their useful lives and tested for impairment like pp&e. infinite-lived intangibles are not amortized but tested for impairment annually. both ifrs and u.s. gaap require the following costs to be expensed when incurred: startup and training, admin overhead, advertising and promotion, relocation and reorganization, and termination costs. analysts sometimes exclude intangibles in analysis, but each asset’s value should be considered. goodwill is the excess of purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in a business combination. example: wood corporation buys pine corporation for $600 million. pine’s book value shows $80 million in current assets, $880 million in plant and equipment, and $400 million in liabilities. fair value of plant and equipment is $120 million above book value. adjusted net assets are $560 million. purchase price is $600 million, resulting in $40 million of goodwill. goodwill is not based on what pine had reported previously, but on the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities at acquisition. acquirers may pay more than fair value due to unrecognized assets like brand value or customer loyalty, or due to r&d assets that remain off-balance sheet. expected synergies such as cost savings from facility consolidation or payroll reduction also justify premium prices. in rare cases where purchase price is less than fair value of net assets, the acquirer immediately recognizes a gain in its income statement.
Goodwill is only created in a purchase acquisition. Internally generated goodwill is expensed as incurred. Goodwill is not amortized but must be tested for impairment at least annually. If impaired, goodwill is reduced and a loss is recognized in the income statement. The impairment loss does not affect cash flow. As long as goodwill is not impaired, it can remain on the balance sheet indefinitely. Since goodwill is not amortized, firms can manipulate net income upward by allocating more of the acquisition price to goodwill and less to identifiable assets. The result is less depreciation and amortization expense, resulting in higher net income. Accounting goodwill should not be confused with economic goodwill. Economic goodwill derives from expected future performance of the firm, while accounting goodwill is the result of past acquisitions. When computing ratios, analysts should eliminate goodwill from the balance sheet and goodwill impairment charges from the income statement for comparability. Also, analysts should evaluate future acquisitions in terms of the price paid relative to the earning power of the acquired assets. Financial assets. Financial instruments are contracts that give rise to both a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity. Financial instruments appear on both sides of the balance sheet. Financial assets include investment securities (stocks and bonds), derivatives, loans, and receivables. Financial instruments are measured at historical cost, amortized cost, or fair value. Financial assets measured at cost include unquoted equity investments (when fair value cannot be reliably measured) and loans or receivables. Assets measured at amortized cost are known as held-to-maturity securities, which are debt securities acquired with the intent to be held to maturity. Amortized cost equals the original price minus principal payments, plus amortized discount or minus amortized premium, minus impairment losses. Market value changes are ignored. Financial assets measured at fair value (mark-to-market accounting) include trading securities, available-for-sale securities, and derivatives. Trading securities are acquired to profit in the short term. They are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recognized in the income statement. Derivatives are treated the same. Available-for-sale securities are not expected to be traded or held to maturity. They are also reported at fair value, but unrealized gains and losses appear in other comprehensive income, not the income statement. For all three classifications, dividend and interest income and realized gains or losses are recognized in the income statement. Example: Triple D Corporation buys a 6% bond for $1,000,000. If classified as held-to-maturity, it remains on the balance sheet at $1,000,000 and earns $60,000 interest. If classified as trading, it is marked down to $980,000 with a $20,000 loss and $60,000 interest recognized in the income statement. If available-for-sale, it is also marked to $980,000, interest is recognized in the income statement, and the $20,000 unrealized loss goes to equity. Non-current liabilities. Long-term financial liabilities include bank loans, notes payable, bonds payable, and derivatives. If not issued at face value, they are reported at amortized cost—issue price adjusted for payments, discounts, and premiums. Some financial liabilities are reported at fair value, including held-for-trading liabilities (e.g., stock short positions), derivative liabilities, and liabilities hedged by derivatives. Deferred tax liabilities are future tax obligations resulting from taxable temporary differences. They arise when income tax expense is greater than taxes payable, such as when using accelerated depreciation for tax purposes but straight-line for financial reporting. They also occur when gains or revenues are recognized in financial statements before becoming taxable (e.g., undistributed earnings from subsidiaries). These reverse when the tax is eventually paid. Owners’ equity is the residual interest in assets after liabilities. Components include contributed capital, preferred stock, treasury stock, retained earnings, non-controlling interest, and accumulated other comprehensive income. Contributed capital (issued capital) is the total investment made by equity shareholders.
The par value of common stock is a stated or legal value. Par value has no relationship to fair value. Some common shares are issued without par value. When par value exists, it is reported separately in stockholders’ equity. In that case, the total proceeds from issuing equity securities are the par value plus additional paid-in capital. Also disclosed is the number of common shares authorized, issued, and outstanding. Authorized shares are the maximum allowed under the firm’s charter. Issued shares are those sold to shareholders. Outstanding shares equal issued shares minus treasury stock. Preferred stock has rights not conferred by common stock. Preferred shareholders are paid dividends at a specified rate, usually a percentage of par, and have priority over common shareholders in liquidation. Preferred stock may be classified as debt or equity depending on its terms. Perpetual preferred stock that is non-redeemable is equity. Preferred stock with mandatory redemption is a financial liability. Noncontrolling interest (minority interest) is the minority shareholders’ proportionate share of a subsidiary’s net assets not wholly owned by the parent. Retained earnings are the cumulative net income not paid as dividends. Treasury stock is reacquired stock not retired. Treasury stock reduces stockholders’ equity, has no voting rights, and does not receive dividends. Accumulated other comprehensive income includes all changes in equity except net income and shareholder transactions such as issuing stock or dividends. Comprehensive income equals net income plus other comprehensive income. It is easy to confuse “comprehensive income,” which is measured over a period, with “accumulated other comprehensive income,” which is a balance sheet item at a point in time and does not include net income. The statement of changes in stockholders’ equity summarizes transactions that affect equity accounts during the period. It reconciles beginning and ending balances of capital stock, paid-in capital, retained earnings, and accumulated other comprehensive income. Components of accumulated other comprehensive income include unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities, cash flow hedges, foreign currency translation, and minimum pension liability adjustments. A vertical common-size balance sheet expresses each balance sheet item as a percentage of total assets. This standardizes financial statements for comparison over time (time-series analysis) and across firms (cross-sectional analysis). For example, compare East Company and West Company. East’s balance sheet: cash $2,300, accounts receivable $3,700, inventory $5,500, current assets $11,500, plant and equipment $32,500, goodwill $1,750, total assets $45,750. Liabilities: current liabilities $10,100, long-term debt $26,500, total liabilities $36,600, equity $9,150. West’s balance sheet: cash $1,500, accounts receivable $1,100, inventory $900, current assets $3,500, plant and equipment $11,750, goodwill $0, total assets $15,250. Liabilities: current liabilities $1,000, long-term debt $5,100, total liabilities $6,100, equity $9,150. By converting to common-size format: East cash 5%, accounts receivable 8%, inventory 12%, current assets 25%, plant and equipment 71%, goodwill 4%, total assets 100%. West cash 10%, accounts receivable 7%, inventory 6%, current assets 23%, plant and equipment 77%, goodwill 0%, total assets 100%. Liabilities and equity: East current liabilities 22%, long-term debt 58%, total liabilities 80%, equity 20%. West current liabilities 7%, long-term debt 33%, total liabilities 40%, equity 60%. East has a higher percentage of current liabilities (22%) compared to West (7%), suggesting East is less liquid and may face challenges meeting short-term obligations. West’s stronger working capital position may be inefficient, as returns on working capital are typically lower than returns on long-term assets. East also holds less cash relative to assets (5%) versus West (10%). East may need to sell inventory or collect receivables to meet obligations. East’s inventory as a percentage of total assets is 12%, double West’s 6%, potentially indicating obsolescence risks. East’s long-term debt is 58% of assets, much higher than West’s 33%, implying East may struggle to meet long-term obligations due to a debt-heavy capital structure.
Common-size analysis can also be used to examine a firm’s strategies. East appears to be growing through acquisitions since it is reporting goodwill. West is growing internally since no goodwill is reported. It could be that East is financing the acquisitions with debt. Balance sheet ratios compare balance sheet items only. Balance sheet ratios, along with common-size analysis, can be used to evaluate a firm’s liquidity and solvency. The results should be compared over time (time-series analysis) and across firms (cross-sectional analysis). Liquidity ratios measure the firm’s ability to satisfy its short-term obligations as they come due. Liquidity ratios include the current ratio, the quick ratio, and the cash ratio. Although all three ratios measure the firm’s ability to pay current liabilities, they should be considered collectively. For example, assume Firm A has a higher current ratio but a lower quick ratio compared to Firm B. This is due to higher inventory in Firm A. The quick ratio excludes inventory from current assets. A similar comparison between quick and cash ratios excludes both inventory and receivables. Solvency ratios measure the firm’s ability to satisfy its long-term obligations. These include the long-term debt-to-equity ratio, total debt-to-equity ratio, debt ratio, and financial leverage ratio. These should also be considered collectively. Firm A might have a higher long-term debt-to-equity ratio but a lower total debt-to-equity ratio than Firm B, suggesting Firm B uses more short-term debt. When calculating solvency ratios, debt refers to any interest-bearing obligation. The financial leverage ratio considers both interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing obligations. Analysts must understand the limitations of balance sheet ratio analysis: peer comparisons are limited by differences in accounting standards and estimates, lack of homogeneity among firms in different industries, interpretation requires judgment, and balance sheet data reflect only a single point in time. Assets are resources controlled due to past transactions expected to provide future economic benefits. Liabilities are obligations from past events requiring outflows of resources. Equity is the residual interest in assets after deducting liabilities. A financial item should be recognized if a future economic benefit is probable and its value or cost can be reliably measured. The balance sheet assesses a firm’s liquidity, solvency, and ability to pay dividends. Asset, liability, and equity values are not necessarily market or intrinsic values. Most balance sheets mix historical cost, amortized cost, and fair value. Some items are hard to quantify and not reported. A classified balance sheet separates current and noncurrent assets and liabilities. Alternatively, liquidity-based presentations list assets and liabilities by liquidity, used in banking. Current assets and liabilities are expected to be used or settled in less than one year or one operating cycle, whichever is longer. Noncurrent are those expected beyond that period. Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid assets readily convertible to cash, with values close to amortized or fair value. Accounts receivable are reported at net realizable value, adjusting for estimated bad debts. Inventories are reported at lower of cost or net realizable value (IFRS) or market (US GAAP). Cost methods include standard costing or retail method. Cost flow assumptions affect valuation. Property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) are reported under the cost or revaluation model (IFRS), only cost model under US GAAP. Impairment occurs when carrying value exceeds recoverable amount. Recovery of impairment is allowed under IFRS but not US GAAP. Internally created intangible assets are expensed. Purchased intangibles follow PP&E rules. Under IFRS, research costs are expensed; development costs can be capitalized. US GAAP requires both to be expensed. Goodwill is the excess of purchase price over fair value of net identifiable assets in an acquisition. Goodwill is not amortized but must be tested annually for impairment. Held-to-maturity securities are at amortized cost. Trading securities, available-for-sale securities, and derivatives are at fair value. Trading and derivatives recognize unrealized gains and losses in the income statement. Available-for-sale recognizes unrealized gains and losses in equity as other comprehensive income. Accounts payable are owed to suppliers. Accrued liabilities are expenses recognized but not yet due. Unearned revenue is cash received for future goods or services. Financial liabilities not issued at face value are reported at amortized cost. Held-for-trading and derivative liabilities are reported at fair value. Owners’ equity includes: contributed capital (amount paid by shareholders), preferred stock (with special rights, classified as debt if redeemable), treasury stock (repurchased shares, reduces equity), retained earnings (cumulative net income not paid as dividends), noncontrolling interest (subsidiary ownership not held by parent), accumulated other comprehensive income (equity changes excluding net income and shareholder transactions). The statement of changes in stockholders’ equity summarizes equity-affecting transactions during the period. A vertical common-size balance sheet shows each item as a percentage of total assets, standardizing data for size and enabling time-series and cross-sectional comparisons. Balance sheet ratios, along with common-size analysis, evaluate liquidity and solvency. Liquidity ratios include the current ratio, quick ratio, and cash ratio. Solvency ratios include long-term debt-to-equity, total debt-to-equity, debt ratio, and financial leverage ratio.
