UNDERSTANDING BALANCE SHEETS
Study Session 7
EXAM FOCUS
While the income statement presents a picture of a firm's economic activities over a
PEriod of time, its balance sheet is a snapshot of its financial and physical assets and its
liabilities at a point in time. Just as with the income statement, understanding balance
sheet accounts, how they are valued, and what they represent, is also crucial to the
financial analysis of a firm. Again, different choices of accounting methods and
different accounting estimates will affect a firm's financial ratios, and an analyst must
be careful to make the necessary adjustments in order to compare two or more firms.
SPEcial attention should be paid to the method by which each balance sheet item is
calculated and how changes in balance sheet values relate to the income statement
and to shareholders' equity. The next Study Session includes more detailed
information on several balance sheet accounts, including inventories, long-lived assets,
deferred taxes, and long-term liabilities.
LOS 25.a: Describe the elements of the balance sheet: assets, liabilities, and equity.
CFA(r) Program Curriculum, Volume 3, page 218
The balance sheet (also known as the statement of financial position or statement of
financial condition) reports the firm's financial position at a point in time. The balance
sheet consists of assets, liabilities, and equity.
Assets: Resources controlled as a result of past transactions that are exPEcted to
provide future economic benefits.
Liabilities: Obligations as a result of past events that are exPEcted to require an
outflow of economic resources.
Equity: The owners' residual interest in the assets after deducting the liabilities. Equity
is also referred to as stockholders' equity, shareholders' equity, or owners' equity.
Analysts sometimes refer to equity as "net assets."
A financial statement item should be recognized if a future economic benefit from the
item (flowing to or from the firm) is probable and the item's value or cost can be
measured reliably.
LOS 25.b: Describe uses and limitations of the balance sheet in financial analysis.
CFA(r) Program Curriculum, Volume 3, page 218
The balance sheet can be used to assess a firm's liquidity, solvency, and ability to make
distributions to shareholders. From the firm's PErsPEctive, liquidity is the ability to
meet short-term obligations and solvency is the ability to meet long-term obligations.
The balance sheet elements (assets, liabilities, and equity) should not be interpreted as
market value or intrinsic value. For most firms, the balance sheet consists of a mixture
of values. For example, some assets are reported at historical cost, some are reported
at amortized cost, and others may be reported at fair value. There are numerous
valuation bases. Even if the balance sheet was reported at fair value, the value may
have changed since the balance sheet date. Also, there are a number of assets and
liabilities that do not apPEar on the balance sheet but certainly have value. For
example, the value of a firm's employees and reputation is not reported on the
balance sheet.
LOS 25.c: Describe alternative formats of balance sheet presentation.
CFA(r) Program Curriculum, Volume 3, page 221
Both IFRS and U.S. GAAP require firms to separately report their current assets and
noncurrent assets and current and noncurrent liabilities. The current/noncurrent
format is known as a classified balance sheet and is useful in evaluating liquidity.
Under IFRS, firms can choose to use a liquidity-based format if the presentation is
more relevant and reliable. Liquidity-based presentations, which are often used in the
banking industry, present assets and liabilities in the order of liquidity.
LOS 25.d: Distinguish between current and non-current assets and current and noncurrent liabilities.
CFA(r) Program Curriculum, Volume 3, page 221
Current assets include cash and other assets that will likely be converted into cash or
used up within one year or one oPErating cycle, whichever is greater. The oPErating
cycle is the time it takes to produce or purchase inventory, sell the product, and collect
the cash. Current assets are usually presented in the order of their liquidity, with cash
being the most liquid. Current assets reveal information about the oPErating activities
of the firm.
Current liabilities are obligations that will be satisfied within one year or one oPErating
cycle, whichever is greater. More sPEcifically, a liability that meets any of the following
criteria is considered current:
Settlement is exPEcted during the normal oPErating cycle.
Settlement is exPEcted within one year.
Held primarily for trading purposes.
There is not an unconditional right to defer settlement for more than one year.
Current assets minus current liabilities equals working capital. Not enough working
capital may indicate liquidity problems. Too much working capital may be an indication
of inefficient use of assets.
Noncurrent assets do not meet the definition of current assets because they will not
be converted into cash or used up within one year or oPErating cycle. Noncurrent
assets provide information about the firm's investing activities, which form the
foundation upon which the firm oPErates.
Noncurrent liabilities do not meet the criteria of current liabilities. Noncurrent
liabilities provide information about the firm's long-term financing activities.
LOS 25.e: Describe different tyPEs of assets and liabilities and the measurement
bases of each.
CFA(r) Program Curriculum, Volume 3, page 223
Current Assets
Current assets include cash and other assets that will be converted into cash or used
up within one year or oPErating cycle, whichever is greater.
Cash and cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments
that are readily convertible to cash and near enough to maturity that interest rate risk
is insignificant. Examples of cash equivalents include Treasury bills, commercial paPEr,
and money market funds. Cash and equivalents are considered financial assets.
Generally, financial assets are reported on the balance sheet at amortized cost or fair
value. For cash equivalents, either measurement base should result in about the same
value.
Marketable SECurities. Marketable SECurities are financial assets that are traded in a
public market and whose value can be readily determined. Examples include Treasury
bills, notes, bonds, and equity SECurities. Details of the investment are disclosed in the
financial footnotes. Measurement bases for marketable SECurities will be discussed
later in this topic review.
Accounts receivable. Accounts receivable (also known as trade receivables) are
financial assets that represent amounts owed to the firm by customers for goods or
services sold on credit. Accounts receivable are reported at net realizable value, which
is based on estimated bad debt exPEnse. Bad debt exPEnse increases the allowance
for doubtful accounts, a contra-asset account. A contra account is used to reduce the
value of its controlling account. Thus, gross receivables less the allowance for doubtful
accounts is equal to accounts receivable at net realizable value, the amount the firm
exPEcts to collect. When receivables are "written off" (removed from the balance
sheet because they are uncollectible), both gross receivables and the allowance
account are reduced.
Firms are required to disclose significant concentrations of credit risk, including
customer, geographic, and industry concentrations.
Analyzing receivables relative to sales can reveal collection problems. The allowance
for doubtful accounts should also be considered relative to the level and growth rate
of sales. Firms can underestimate bad debt exPEnse, thereby increasing reported
earnings.
Inventories. Inventories are goods held for sale to customers or used in manufacture
of goods to be sold. Manufacturing firms separately report inventories of raw
materials, work-in-process, and finished goods.
The costs included in inventory include purchase cost, conversion costs, and other
costs necessary to bring the inventory to its present location and condition. Costs that
are excluded from inventory include abnormal waste, including material, labor, and
manufacturing overhead. Storage costs (unless they are necessary as a part of the
production process), administrative overhead, and selling costs are also excluded.
Standard costing and the retail method are used by some firms to measure inventory
costs. Standard costing, often used by manufacturing firms, involves assigning
predetermined amounts of materials, labor, and overhead to goods produced. Firms
that use the retail method measure inventory at retail prices and then subtract gross
profit in order to determine cost.
Using different cost flow assumptions (also known as cost flow methods), firms assign
inventory costs to the income statement (cost of goods sold). As discussed in the topic
review of Understanding Income Statements, FIFO and average cost are PErmitted
under both IFRS and U.S. GAAP. LIFO is PErmitted under U.S. GAAP but is prohibited
under IFRS.
Inventories are reported at the lower of cost or net realizable value under IFRS, and
under U.S. GAAP for companies that use inventory cost methods other than LIFO or
retail. Net realizable value is equal to the selling price less any completion costs and
disposal (selling) costs. Under U.S. GAAP, companies using LIFO or the retail method
report inventories at the lower of cost or market. Market is usually equal to
replacement cost; however, market cannot be greater than net realizable value or less
than net realizable value less a normal profit margin. If net realizable value (IFRS) or
market (U.S. GAAP) is less than the inventory's carrying value, the inventory is written
down and a loss is recognized in the income statement. If there is a subsequent
recovery in value, the inventory can be written back up under IFRS. No write-up is
allowed under U.S. GAAP; the firm simply reports greater profit when the inventory is
sold.
Professor's Note: Inventories are described in more detail in the next Study Session.
Other current assets. Other current assets are amounts that may not be material if
shown separately; thus, the items are combined into a single amount. Examples
include prepaid exPEnses and deferred tax assets. Prepaid exPEnses are oPErating
costs that have been paid in advance. As the costs are actually incurred, an exPEnse is
recognized in the income statement and prepaid exPEnses (an asset) decrease. For
example, if a firm makes an annual rent payment of $400,000 at the beginning of the
year, an asset (cash) decreases and another asset (prepaid rent) increases by the
amount of the payment. At the end of three months, one-quarter of the prepaid rent
has been used. At this point, the firm will recognize $100,000 of rent exPEnse in its
income statement and reduce assets (prepaid rent) by $100,000.
As we will discuss in our topic review of Income Taxes, deferred taxes are the result of
temporary differences between financial reporting income and tax reporting income.
Deferred tax assets are created when the amount of taxes payable exceeds the
amount of income tax exPEnse recognized in the income statement. This can occur
when exPEnses or losses are recognized in the income statement before they are tax
deductible, or when revenues or gains are taxable before they are recognized in the
income statement. Eventually, the deferred tax asset will reverse when the exPEnse is
deducted for tax purposes or the revenue is recognized in the income statement.
Deferred tax assets can also be created from unused tax losses.
Current Liabilities
Current liabilities are obligations that will be satisfied within one year or oPErating
cycle, whichever is greater.
Accounts payable. Accounts payable (also known as trade payables) are amounts the
firm owes to suppliers for goods or services purchased on credit. Analyzing payables
relative to purchases can signal credit problems with suppliers.
Notes payable and current portion of long-term debt. Notes payable are obligations in
the form of promissory notes owed to creditors and lenders. Notes payable can also be
reported as noncurrent liabilities if their maturities are greater than one year. The
current portion of long-term debt is the principal portion of debt due within one year
or oPErating cycle, whichever is greater.
Accrued liabilities. Accrued liabilities (accrued exPEnses) are exPEnses that have been
recognized in the income statement but are not yet contractually due. Accrued
liabilities result from the accrual method of accounting, under which exPEnses are
recognized as incurred. For example, consider a firm that is required to make annual
year-end interest payments of $100,000 on an outstanding bank loan. At the end of
March, the firm would recognize one-quarter ($25,000) of the total interest exPEnse in
its income statement and an accrued liability would be increased by the same amount,
even though the liability is not actually due until the end of the year.
Some firms include income tax payable as an accrued liability. Taxes payable are
current taxes that have been recognized in the income statement but have not yet
been paid. Other examples of accrued liabilities include interest payable, wages
payable, and accrued warranty exPEnse.
Unearned revenue. Unearned revenue (also known as unearned income, deferred
revenue, or deferred income) is cash collected in advance of providing goods and
services. For example, a magazine publisher receives subscription payments in advance
of delivery. When payment is received, assets (cash) and liabilities (unearned revenue)
increase by the same amount. As the magazines are delivered, the publisher
recognizes revenue in the income statement and reduces the liability.
When analyzing liquidity, keep in mind that unearned revenue does not require a
future outflow of cash like accounts payable. Also, unearned revenue may be an
indication of future growth as the revenue will ultimately be recognized in the income
statement.
Non-Current Assets
ProPErty, plant, and equipment. ProPErty, plant, and equipment (PP&E) are tangible
assets used in the production of goods and services. PP&E includes land and buildings,
machinery and equipment, furniture, and natural resources. Under IFRS, PP&E can be
reported using the cost model or the revaluation model. Under U.S. GAAP, only the
cost model is allowed.
Under the cost model, PP&E other than land is reported at amortized cost (historical
cost minus accumulated depreciation, amortization, depletion, and impairment
losses). Land is not depreciated because it has an indefinite life. Historical cost includes
the purchase price plus any cost necessary to get the asset ready for use, such as
delivery and installation costs. As discussed in the topic review of Understanding
Income Statements, there are several depreciation methods (e.g., straight-line and
declining balance methods) used to allocate the cost to the income statement over
time. Thus, the balance sheet and income statement are affected by the depreciation
method and related estimates (i.e., salvage value and useful life of assets).
Also under the cost model, PP&E must be tested for impairment. An asset is impaired
if its carrying value exceeds the recoverable amount. Under IFRS, the recoverable
amount of an asset is the greater of fair value less any selling costs, or the asset's value
in use. Value in use is the present value of the asset's future cash flow stream. If
impaired, the asset is written down to its recoverable amount and a loss is recognized
in the income statement. Loss recoveries are allowed under IFRS but not under U.S.
GAAP.
Under the revaluation model, PP&E is reported at fair value less any accumulated
depreciation. Changes in fair value are reflected in shareholders' equity and may be
recognized in the income statement in certain circumstances.
Professor's Note: The revaluation model will be discussed in more detail in the topic review of LongLived Assets.
Investment proPErty. Under IFRS, investment proPErty includes assets
that generate rental income or capital appreciation. U.S. GAAP does not
have a sPEcific definition of investment proPErty. Under IFRS, investment
proPErty can either be reported at amortized cost (just like PP&E) or fair value. Under
the fair value model, any change in fair value is recognized in the income statement.
Intangible assets. Intangible assets are non-monetary assets that lack physical
substance. SECurities are not considered intangible assets. Intangible assets are either
identifiable or unidentifiable. Identifiable intangible assets can be acquired separately
or are the result of rights or privileges conveyed to their owner. Examples of
identifiable intangibles are patents, trademarks, and copyrights. Unidentifiable
intangible assets cannot be acquired separately and may have an unlimited life. The
best example of an unidentifiable intangible asset is goodwill.
Under IFRS, identifiable intangibles that are purchased can be reported on the balance
sheet using the cost model or the revaluation model, although the revaluation model
can only be used if an active market for the intangible asset exists. Both models are
basically the same as the measurement models used for PP&E. Under U.S. GAAP, only
the cost model is allowed.
Except for certain legal costs, intangible assets that are created internally, such as
research and development costs, are exPEnsed as incurred under U.S. GAAP. Under
IFRS, a firm must identiFY the research stage (discovery of new scientific or technical
knowledge) and the development stage (using research results to plan or design
products). Under IFRS, the firm must exPEnse costs incurred during the research stage
but can capitalize costs incurred during the development stage.
Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives and tested for
impairment in the same way as PP&E. The amortization method and useful life
estimates are reviewed at least annually. Intangible assets with infinite lives are not
amortized, but are tested for impairment at least annually.
Under IFRS and U.S. GAAP, all of the following should be exPEnsed as incurred:
Start-up and training costs.
Administrative overhead.
Advertising and promotion costs.
Relocation and reorganization costs.
Termination costs.
Some analysts choose to eliminate intangible assets for analytical purposes. However,
analysts should consider the value to the firm of each intangible asset before making
any adjustments.
Goodwill. Goodwill is the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the
identifiable net assets (assets minus liabilities) acquired in a business acquisition. Let's
look at an example of calculating goodwill.
Example: Goodwill
Wood Corporation paid $600 million for the outstanding stock of Pine Corporation. At the acquisition
date, Pine reported the following condensed balance sheet.
Pine Corporation - Condensed Balance Sheet
The fair value of the plant and equipment was $120 million more than its recorded book value. The fair
values of all other identifiable assets and liabilities were equal to their recorded book values. Calculate the
amount of goodwill Wood should report on its consolidated balance sheet.
Answer:
Current assets
Plant and equipment, net
Liabilities
Fair value of net assets
Purchase price
Book value (millions)
$80
880
(400)
560
600
Less: Fair value of net assets
(560)
Acquisition goodwill
40
Goodwill is equal to the excess of purchase price over the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities
acquired. Plant and equipment was "written up" by $120 million to reflect fair value. The goodwill
reported on Pine's balance sheet is an unidentifiable asset and is thus ignored in the calculation of Wood's
goodwill.
Acquirers are often willing to pay more than the fair value of the target's identifiable
net assets because the target may have assets that are not reported on its balance
sheet. For example, the target's reputation and customer loyalty certainly have value;
however, the value is not quantifiable. Also, the target may have research and
development assets that remain off-balance-sheet because of current accounting
standards. Finally, part of the acquisition price may reflect PErceived synergies from
the business combination. For example, the acquirer may be able to eliminate
duplicate facilities and reduce payroll as a result of the acquisition.
Professor's Note: Occasionally the purchase price of an acquisition is less than fair value of the
identifiable net assets. In this case, the difference is immediately recognized as a gain in the
acquirer's income statement.
Goodwill is only created in a purchase acquisition. Internally generated goodwill is
exPEnsed as incurred.
Goodwill is not amortized but must be tested for impairment at least annually. If
impaired, goodwill is reduced and a loss is recognized in the income statement. The
impairment loss does not affect cash flow. As long as goodwill is not impaired, it can
remain on the balance sheet indefinitely.
Since goodwill is not amortized, firms can manipulate net income upward by allocating
more of the acquisition price to goodwill and less to the identifiable assets. The result
is less depreciation and amortization exPEnse, resulting in higher net income.
Accounting goodwill should not be confused with economic goodwill. Economic
goodwill derives from the exPEcted future PErformance of the firm, while accounting
goodwill is the result of past acquisitions.
When computing ratios, analysts should eliminate goodwill from the balance sheet and
goodwill impairment charges from the income statement for comparability. Also,
analysts should evaluate future acquisitions in terms of the price paid relative to the
earning power of the acquired assets.
Financial assets. Financial instruments are contracts that give rise to both a financial
asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity.1
Financial instruments can be found on the asset side and the liability side of the
balance sheet. Financial assets include investment SECurities (stocks and bonds),
derivatives, loans, and receivables.
Financial instruments are measured at historical cost, amortized cost, or fair value.
Financial assets measured at cost include unquoted equity investments (whereby fair
value cannot be reliably measured) and loans to and receivables from other entities.
Financial assets measured at amortized cost are known as held-to-maturity SECurities.
Held-to-maturity SECurities are debt SECurities acquired with the intent to be held to
maturity. Amortized cost is equal to the original issue price minus any principal
payments, plus any amortized discount or minus any amortized premium, minus any
impairment losses. Subsequent changes in market value are ignored.
Financial assets measured at fair value, also known as mark-to-market accounting,
include trading SECurities, available-for-sale SECurities, and derivatives.
Trading SECurities (also known as held-for-trading SECurities) are debt and equity
SECurities acquired with the intent to profit over the near term. Trading SECurities are
reported on the balance sheet at fair value, and the unrealized gains and losses
(changes in market value before the SECurities are sold) are recognized in the income
statement. Unrealized gains and losses are also known as holding PEriod gains and
losses. Derivative instruments are treated the same as trading SECurities.
Available-for-sale SECurities are debt and equity SECurities that are not exPEcted to be
held to maturity or traded in the near term. Like trading SECurities, available-for-sale
SECurities are reported on the balance sheet at fair value. However, any unrealized
gains and losses are not recognized in the income statement, but are reported in other
comprehensive income as a part of shareholders' equity.
For all three classifications of SECurities, dividend and interest income and realized
gains and losses (actual gains or losses when the SECurities are sold) are recognized in
the income statement.
Figure 1 summarizes the different classifications and measurement bases of financial
assets.

Example: Classification of investment SECurities
Triple D Corporation purchased a 6% bond, at par, for $1,000,000 at the beginning of the year. Interest
rates have recently increased and the market value of the bond declined $20,000. Determine the bond's
effect on Triple D's financial statements under each classification of SECurities.
Answer:
If the bond is classified as a held-to-maturity SECurity, the bond is reported on the balance sheet at
$1,000,000. Interest income of $60,000 [$1,000,000 x 6%] is reported in the income statement.
If the bond is classified as a trading SECurity, the bond is reported on the balance sheet at $980,000. The
$20,000 unrealized loss and $60,000 of interest income are both recognized in the income statement.
If the bond is classified as an available-for-sale SECurity, the bond is reported on the balance sheet at
$980,000. Interest income of $60,000 is recognized in the income statement. The $20,000 unrealized loss
is not recognized in the income statement. Rather, it is reported as a change in stockholders' equity.
Non-Current Liabilities
Long-term financial liabilities. Financial liabilities include bank loans, notes payable,
bonds payable, and derivatives. If the financial liabilities are not issued at face amount,
the liabilities are usually reported on the balance sheet at amortized cost. Amortized
cost is equal to the issue price minus any principal payments, plus any amortized
discount or minus any amortized premium.
In some cases, financial liabilities are reported at fair value. Examples include held-fortrading liabilities such as a short position in a stock (which may be classified as a shortterm liability), derivative liabilities, and non-derivative liabilities with exposures hedged
by derivatives.
Deferred tax liabilities. Deferred tax liabilities are amounts of income taxes payable in
future PEriods as a result of taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax liabilities are
created when the amount of income tax exPEnse recognized in the income statement
is greater than taxes payable. This can occur when exPEnses or losses are tax
deductible before they are recognized in the income statement. A good example is
when a firm uses an accelerated depreciation method for tax purposes and the
straight-line method for financial reporting. Deferred tax liabilities are also created
when revenues or gains are recognized in the income statement before they are
taxable. For example, a firm often recognizes the earnings of a subsidiary before any
distributions (dividends) are made. Eventually, deferred tax liabilities will reverse when
the taxes are paid.
LOS 25.f: Describe the components of shareholders' equity.
CFA(r) Program Curriculum, Volume 3, page 247
Owners' equity is the residual interest in assets that remains after subtracting an
entity's liabilities. Owners' equity includes contributed capital, preferred stock,
treasury stock, retained earnings, non-controlling interest, and accumulated other
comprehensive income.
Contributed capital (also known as issued capital) is the amount contributed by equity
shareholders.
The par value of common stock is a stated or legal value. Par value has no relationship
to fair value. Some common shares are even issued without a par value. When par
value exists, it is reported separately in stockholders' equity. In that case, the total
proceeds from issuing an equity SECurity are the par value of the issued shares plus
"additional paid-in capital."
Also disclosed is the number of common shares that are authorized, issued, and
outstanding. Authorized shares are the number of shares that may be sold under the
firm's articles of incorporation. Issued shares are the number of shares that have
actually been sold to shareholders. The number of outstanding shares is equal to the
issued shares less shares that have been reacquired by the firm (i.e., treasury stock).
Preferred stock has certain rights and privileges not conferred by common stock. For
example, preferred shareholders are paid dividends at a sPEcified rate, usually
expressed as a PErcentage of par value, and have priority over the claims of the
common shareholders in the event of liquidation.
Preferred stock can be classified as debt or equity, dePEnding on the terms. For
example, PErPEtual preferred stock that is non-redeemable is considered equity.
However, preferred stock that calls for mandatory redemption in fixed amounts is
considered a financial liability.
Noncontrolling interest ( minority interest) is the minority shareholders' pro-rata
share of the net assets (equity) of a subsidiary that is not wholly owned by the parent.
Retained earnings are the undistributed earnings (net income) of the firm since
inception, the cumulative earnings that have not been paid out to shareholders as
dividends.
Treasury stock is stock that has been reacquired by the issuing firm but not yet retired.
Treasury stock reduces stockholders' equity. It does not represent an investment in the
firm. Treasury stock has no voting rights and does not receive dividends.
Accumulated other comprehensive income includes all changes in stockholders'
equity except for transactions recognized in the income statement (net income) and
transactions with shareholders, such as issuing stock, reacquiring stock, and paying
dividends.
As discussed in the topic review of Understanding Income Statements, comprehensive
income aggregates net income and certain sPEcial transactions that are not reported in
the income statement but that affect stockholders' equity. These sPEcial transactions
comprise what is known as "other comprehensive income." Comprehensive income is
equal to net income plus other comprehensive income.
is easy to confuse the two terms "comprehensive
income" and
Professor's Note: It
"accumulated other comprehensive income." Comprehensive income is an income measure
over a PEriod of time. It includes net income and other comprehensive income for the PEriod.
Accumulated other comprehensive income does not include net income but is a component of
stockholders' equity at a point in time.
The statement of changes in stockholders' equity summarizes all transactions that
increase or decrease the equity accounts for the PEriod. The statement includes
transactions with shareholders and reconciles the beginning and ending balance of
each equity account, including capital stock, additional paid-in-capital, retained
earnings, and accumulated other comprehensive income. In addition, the components
of accumulated other comprehensive income are disclosed (i.e., unrealized gains and
losses from available-for-sale SECurities, cash flow hedging derivatives, foreign
currency translation, and adjustments for minimum PEnsion liability).
A statement of changes in stockholders' equity is illustrated in Figure 2.
Figure 2: Sample Statement of Changes in Stockholders' Equity
LOS 25.g: Convert balance sheets to common-size balance sheets and interpret
common-size balance sheets.
CFA(r) Program Curriculum, Volume 3, page 252
A vertical common-size balance sheet expresses each item of the balance sheet as a
PErcentage of total assets. The common-size format standardizes the balance sheet by
eliminating the effects of size. This allows for comparison over time (time-series
analysis) and across firms (cross-SECtional analysis). For example, following are the
balance sheets of industry comPEtitors East Company and West Company.

East's investment in current assets of 25% of total assets is slightly higher than West's
current assets of 23%. However, East's current liabilities of 22% of total assets are
significantly higher than West's current liabilities of 7%. Thus, East is less liquid and
may have more difficulty paying its current obligations when due. However, West's
suPErior working capital position may not be an efficient use of resources. The
investment returns on working capital are usually lower than the returns on long-term
assets.
A closer look at current assets reveals that East reports less cash as a PErcentage of
assets than West. In fact, East does not have enough cash to satisFY its current
liabilities without selling more inventory and collecting receivables. East's inventories
of 12% of total assets are higher than West's inventories of 6%. Carrying higher
inventories may be an indication of inventory obsolescence. Further analysis of
inventory is necessary.
Not only are East's current liabilities higher than West's, but East's long-term debt of
58% of total assets is much greater than West's long-term debt of 33%. Thus, East may
have trouble satisFYing its long-term obligations since its capital structure consists of
more debt.
Common-size analysis can also be used to examine a firm's strategies. East apPEars to
be growing through acquisitions since it is reporting goodwill. West is growing
internally since no goodwill is reported. It could be that East is financing the
acquisitions with debt.
LOS 25.h: Calculate and interpret liquidity and solvency ratios.
CFA(r) Program Curriculum, Volume 3, page 260
Balance sheet ratios compare balance sheet items only. Balance sheet ratios, along
with common-size analysis, can be used to evaluate a firm's liquidity and solvency. The
results should be compared over time (time-series analysis) and across firms (crossSECtional analysis).
Professor's Note: Ratio analysis is covered in more detail in the topic review of Financial Analysis
Techniques.
Liquidity ratios measure the firm's ability to satisFY its short-term obligations as they
come due. Liquidity ratios include the current ratio, the quick ratio, and the cash ratio.
Although all three ratios measure the firm's ability to pay current liabilities, they
should be considered collectively. For example, assume Firm A has a higher current
ratio but a lower quick ratio as compared to Firm B. This is the result of higher
inventory as compared to Firm B. The quick ratio (also known as the acid-test ratio) is
calculated by excluding inventory from current assets. Similar analysis can be
PErformed by comparing the quick ratio and the cash ratio. The cash ratio is calculated
by excluding inventory and receivables.
Solvency ratios measure the firm's ability to satisFY its long-term obligations. Solvency
ratios include the long-term debt-to-equity ratio, the total debt-to-equity ratio, the
debt ratio, and the financial leverage ratio.
All four ratios measure solvency but they should be considered collectively. For
example, Firm A might have a higher long-term debt-to-equity ratio but a lower total
debt-to-equity ratio as compared to Firm B. This is an indication that Firm B is utilizing
more short-term debt to finance itself.
When calculating solvency ratios, debt is considered to be any interest bearing
obligation. On the other hand, the financial leverage ratio captures the impact of all
obligations, both interest bearing and non-interest bearing.
Analysts must understand the limitations of balance sheet ratio analysis:
Comparisons with PEer firms are limited by differences in accounting standards
and estimates.
Lack of homogeneity as many firms oPErate in different industries.
Interpretation of ratios requires significant judgment.
Balance sheet data are only measured at a single point in time.

KEY CONCEPTS
LOS 25.a
Assets are resources controlled as result of past transactions that are exPEcted to
provide future economic benefits. Liabilities are obligations as a result of past events
that are exPEcted to require an outflow of economic resources. Equity is the owners'
residual interest in the assets after deducting the liabilities.
A financial statement item should be recognized if a future economic benefit to or
from the firm is probable and the item's value or cost can be measured reliably.
LOS 25.b
The balance sheet can be used to assess a firm's liquidity, solvency, and ability to pay
dividends to shareholders.
Balance sheet assets, liabilities, and equity should not be interpreted as market value
or intrinsic value. For most firms, the balance sheet consists of a mixture of values
including historical cost, amortized cost, and fair value.
Some assets and liabilities are difficult to quantiFY and are not reported on the balance
sheet.
LOS 25.c
A classified balance sheet separately reports current and noncurrent assets and
current and noncurrent liabilities. Alternatively, liquidity-based presentations, often
used in the banking industry, present assets and liabilities in order of liquidity.
LOS 25.d
Current (noncurrent) assets are those exPEcted to be used up or converted to cash in
less than (more than) one year or the firm's oPErating cycle, whichever is greater.
Current (noncurrent) liabilities are those the firm exPEcts to satisFY in less than (more
than) one year or the firm's oPErating cycle, whichever is greater.
LOS 25.e
Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid financial assets that are readily
convertible to cash. Their balance sheet values are generally close to identical using
either amortized cost or fair value.
Accounts receivable are reported at net realizable value by estimating bad debt
exPEnse.
Inventories are reported at the lower of cost or net realizable value (IFRS) or the lower
of cost or market (U.S. GAAP). Cost can be measured using standard costing or the
retail method. Different cost flow assumptions can affect inventory values.
ProPErty, plant, and equipment (PP&E) can be reported using the cost model or the
revaluation model under IFRS. Under U.S. GAAP, only the cost model is allowed. PP&E
is impaired if its carrying value exceeds the recoverable amount. Recoveries of
impairment losses are allowed under IFRS but not U.S. GAAP.
Intangible assets created internally are exPEnsed as incurred. Purchased intangibles
are reported similar to PP&E. Under IFRS, research costs are exPEnsed as incurred and
development costs are capitalized. Both research and development costs are exPEnsed
under U.S. GAAP.
Goodwill is the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net
assets (assets minus liabilities) acquired in a business acquisition. Goodwill is not
amortized but must be tested for impairment at least annually.
Held-to-maturity SECurities are reported at amortized cost. Trading SECurities,
available-for-sale SECurities, and derivatives are reported at fair value. For trading
SECurities and derivatives, unrealized gains and losses are recognized in the income
statement. Unrealized gains and losses for available-for-sale SECurities are reported in
equity (other comprehensive income).
Accounts payable are amounts owed to suppliers for goods or services purchased on
credit. Accrued liabilities are exPEnses that have been recognized in the income
statement but are not yet contractually due. Unearned revenue is cash collected in
advance of providing goods and services.
Financial liabilities not issued at face value, like bonds payable, are reported at
amortized cost. Held-for-trading liabilities and derivative liabilities are reported at fair
value.
LOS 25.f
Owners' equity includes:
Contributed capital--the amount paid in by common shareholders.
Preferred stock--capital stock that has certain rights and privileges not
possessed by the common shareholders. Classified as debt if mandatorily
redeemable.
Treasury stock--issued common stock that has been repurchased by the firm.
Retained earnings--the cumulative undistributed earnings of the firm since
inception.
Noncontrolling (minority) interest--the portion of a subsidiary that is not
owned by the parent.
Accumulated other comprehensive income--includes all changes to equity from
sources other than net income and transactions with shareholders.
The statement of changes in stockholders' equity summarizes the transactions during a
PEriod that increase or decrease equity, including transactions with shareholders.
LOS 25.g
A vertical common-size balance sheet expresses each item of the balance sheet as a
PErcentage of total assets. The common-size format standardizes the balance sheet by
eliminating the effects of size. This allows for comparison over time (time-series
analysis) and across firms (cross-SECtional analysis).
LOS 25.h
Balance sheet ratios, along with common-size analysis, can be used to evaluate a firm's
liquidity and solvency. Liquidity ratios measure the firm's ability to satisFY its shortterm obligations as they come due. Liquidity ratios include the current ratio, the quick
ratio, and the cash ratio.
Solvency ratios measure the firm's ability to satisFY its long-term obligations. Solvency
ratios include the long-term debt-to-equity ratio, the total debt-to-equity ratio, the
debt ratio, and the financial leverage ratio.
