Description
Dell just released its Q1 earnings release. Despite very encouraging AI-related revenue growth, the shares sold off slightly. This creates a great opportunity to own a company with big AI tailwinds and shareholder friendly capital allocation strategy. 
Business description
Infrastructure Solutions Group (ISG) – Enterprise Servers & Storage
Dell’s ISG is a leader in the enterprise server market.ISG has seen robust long-term demand from enterprise and cloud customers. In FY2023, ISG delivered record revenue of $38.4 billion (up 12% YoY) with operating income of $5.0 billion, reflecting a strong operating margin of roughly 13% . The following year, FY2024, macroeconomic headwinds and softer IT spending led ISG revenue to decline 12% to $33.9 billion, with operating income falling to $4.3 billion (margin ~12.6%) . This dip was broad-based across regions as customers paused infrastructure investments . However, FY2025 saw a sharp rebound: ISG revenue surged 29% to $43.6 billion, and operating income jumped to $5.6 billion – restoring margin to ~12.8% . This growth was fueled by strong demand for next-generation servers (particularly AI-optimized servers) and storage, with ISG fourth-quarter FY25 revenue up 22% YoY . Notably, ISG’s growth in FY2025 was global, led by the Americas (including the U.S.) as organizations ramped up data center investments . Overall, ISG consistently generates low-teens operating margins. 
AI has been a major growth driver for the last two years
Dell’s ISG segment is at the core of the company’s AI infrastructure strategy. Dell has a broad portfolio of servers, storage, and software optimized for AI workloads. Dell has cultivated a broad partner ecosystem to bolster its AI offerings: collaborating with NVIDIA on validated solutions (from AI software frameworks to GPU-accelerated systems) , working with cloud providers and AI startups (e.g. Cohere, Mistral AI) for on-premise AI deployments , and even co-engineering telecom AI infrastructure with Nokia . In services, Dell’s AI Factory initiative provides an end-to-end platform (spanning edge devices to data center clusters) to simplify AI adoption for customers . This focus positions ISG to capture ongoing AI-driven infrastructure spending.
Financial Performance (FY2023–FY2025)
CSG is Dell’s PC and client devices business, which experienced a boom during the pandemic and a contraction thereafter. Over the three-year period CSG’s top line contracted from its pandemic peak, but the segment maintained solid profitability through cost controls and focus on commercial customers. It remains the larger revenue contributor compared to ISG, but with significantly lower growth momentum and operating margins in mid single digit.
AI Strategy and Offerings in CSG
Dell’s CSG segment has pivoted to embrace AI as a key differentiator in its PC and device lineup. In early 2025, Dell redesigned its PC portfolio around AI, launching new “AI PCs” with on-device intelligence and unified branding. These “AI-ready” machines are branded under a simplified hierarchy (Dell, Dell Pro, Dell Pro Max) aimed at making it easier for customers to choose high-performance, AI-capable endpoints . Alongside hardware, Dell works with chip partners (e.g. collaborating with Intel and AMD on AI-accelerated CPU platforms and with Qualcomm on integrating NPUs in PCs ) and with software leaders (ensuring support for AI frameworks and security on Windows 11, etc.). Notably, Dell’s premium laptops can be configured with NVIDIA RTX GPUs, enabling data scientists and creators to run AI modeling tasks on portable workstations .By embedding AI into its client products and services, Dell aims to drive a PC refresh cycle and position its CSG offerings as essential tools for productivity and collaboration in the AI era.
Catalysts: AI adoption and tariff relief
Although the majority of Dell’s AI server sales currently go to neo cloud providers (think CoreWeave), we could see high demand from other types of customers in the near future, further boosting Dell’s revenue.
Enterprise On-Premise and Sovereign AI Adoption
Enterprises are increasingly shifting AI workloads from public clouds to on-premise environments. This trend is fueled by concerns over data privacy, escalating cloud costs, and the desire for greater control over AI operations. Relying solely on cloud-based AI inference can lead to higher costs, intellectual property security risks, and vendor lock-in, whereas bringing inference in-house offers significant financial and strategic advantages as AI initiatives scale.  
Moreover, regulatory frameworks like the EU AI Act and ISO/IEC 42001 are accelerating this shift, pushing enterprises to take back control of where and how their AI operates. For many, this means keeping sensitive workloads on-premise to ensure compliance and data sovereignty.  
Sovereign AI refers to a nation’s pursuit of autonomous AI capabilities, ensuring that data and AI infrastructure remain within national borders.Government-led sovereign AI initiatives generally share common drivers: protecting national security, keeping sensitive data within local jurisdiction, fostering domestic tech innovation, and ensuring AI systems reflect local values and needs . In effect, countries are treating advanced AI infrastructure as a strategic asset – leading to a wave of state-backed on-premise AI builds. For example, countries in the middle east rich with oil money are eager to invest in AI infrastructure.Saudi Arabia is aggressively investing to become a global AI powerhouse. In May 2025, Saudi Arabia partnered with NVIDIA to build several large-scale “AI factories” – sovereign AI data centers with up to hundreds of thousands of NVIDIA GPUs over five years
Dell Technologies, leveraging its decades of strong relationship with NVDA, has positioned itself as a leader in AI infrastructure for both the enterprise and the sovereign nations, offering solutions like the AI Factory 2.0, which provides scalable, on-premise AI capabilities. Dell’s approach emphasizes bringing AI to the data, catering to enterprises’ needs for data sovereignty and low-latency processing.
AI PC adoption 
Key drivers for AI PCs include a corporate upgrade cycle (aging install base moving to Windows 11 PCs with AI features) and demand for on-device productivity AI. Enterprise buyers will see AI PCs as strategic tools for productivity without compromising security. PCs with local AI can handle sensitive data or complex tasks without cloud connectivity, addressing data security concerns . This “privacy-first” trend will trigger a premiumization in this market – AI-equipped PCs command higher prices, lifting PC revenues even as overall PC unit growth is modest
Tariff impact/What tariff impact
In a timely article published at the height of tariff uncertainty in early April, SemiAnalysis wrote about Dell’s resilient global supply chain. Especially thanks to Dell’s assembly operation in Mexico, Dell’s NA bound computers will receive no tariff impact. In the latest earnings call, management has indirectly confirmed SemiAnalysis’  claim without mentioning Mexico:
“Our industry-leading supply chain is a unique advantage in the dynamic environment we are operating in today. We are leveraging the agility and resilience we have built over the past four decades, enabling us to navigate numerous challenges over the years, and allows us to minimize the impact on our customers and shareholders
We did not make any price moves in the quarter. We were steady. We had been through this before. And I think we weathered the storm quite well, and ultimately took care of our customers and served them quite well.”
Contrast that with HP that said it would take 6-9 months to re-route their supply chain to minimize the tariff impact.
Reading the current administration’s position on tariffs, it seems unlikely that the White House would want to tariff these computing devices amid a fierce AI competition against China. And it is almost impossible for Dell and the other major PC manufacturers like HP to eat the tariff given their relatively thin operating margin compared to Apple. In a scenario that semi sectorial tariff is implemented, these companies will be forced to raise prices, hurt American companies and consumers, and hinder the progress on AI adoption in America and GDP growth.  
Therefore,if trade negotiations goes well, Dell should enjoy a rally with the rest of the semi stocks; if trade negotiations fall off and reciprocal tariff remains high, Dell’s gross margin will be little impacted. 
Valuation
The stock sold off on the FY26 Q1 print despite that the company has not downgraded its revenue or EPS guidance for the fiscal year. The reason is most likely that the company couldn't meet heightened expectation going into earnings. The company is guiding 7.85 GAAP earnings per share. Adding back amortization of intangibles, earnings this year is about 8.5 per share. There is also some conservatism embedded in the guidance due to macro uncertainties - the company has guided 15B AI server revenue this year but in H1 they company will have shipped 9B of revenue. So it’s entirely possible for Dell to raise its AI revenue and EPS guidance later this year. 
Trading at roughly 13 times FY 26 EPS, the stock is extremely attractive given the growth in AI servers and AI PC. Capital allocation is also very shareholder friendly. The company is guiding 100% NI to adj. FCF conversion and 80%+ target return of adj FCF to shareholders. The stock currently has a 1.88% dividend and the company has been actively buying back shares. Taking advantage of market volatility during April, Dell has repurchased 2.4B or more than 3% of its stock during the last  Q.
