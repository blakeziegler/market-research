Top Page Eaton (NYSE:ETN) Rating: 81 Outperform Price Target: $439.00 (23.16% Upside) Eatons overall stock score reflects its strong financial performance and positive earnings call, which highlight growth potential and operational efficiency. Technical indicators show bullish momentum, though valuation concerns may limit future gains. Challenges in the Vehicle segment and global trade uncertainties pose risks but are currently offset by strengths in other areas. Positive Factors Data Center Growth ETN is expected to continue leading the industry, with Data Center revenue up by approximately 50% and an 18% increase in the negotiation pipeline quarter-over-quarter. Profit Growth Potential ETN has substantial potential for profit growth with a projected tenfold profit increase on a reshored unit of capital expenditure. Reshoring Initiative The US Reshoring initiative is progressing faster than anticipated, positioning ETN as a top beneficiary of this trend. Negative Factors BEV Adoption Concerns With BEV adoption rates tapering, investors may question the relevancy of ETNs Vehicle and eMobility operations to its longer-term growth focus. Margin Pressure Margins are expected to see pressure from dollar for dollar pricing actions, with Q2 expected to see most of the impact due to timing lag. Order Decline Eatons 1Q25 orders are expected to be down year-over-year due to challenging comparisons from a large order in the previous year, not due to a slowdown in the market.
