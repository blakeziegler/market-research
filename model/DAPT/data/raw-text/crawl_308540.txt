AOSL's recent financial performance reflects a company navigating the latter stages of a market correction while simultaneously executing its strategic transformation.
For the three months ended March 31, 2025 (Fiscal Q3 2025), the company reported revenue of $164.6 million.
This represented a solid 9.7% increase compared to the same quarter last year, indicating a recovery from prior downturns, but a 4.9% sequential decline from the December 2024 quarter, partly influenced by the expected wind-down of a significant license revenue stream.
Gross margin in Q3 2025 stood at 22.5% on a non-GAAP basis, a decrease from 24.2% in the prior quarter and 25.2% a year ago.
Management attributed this pressure primarily to average selling price (ASP) erosion, higher material costs, and a less favorable product mix during the period.
ASP erosion, tracking towards historical trend lines but noted as mid-to-high single digits in calendar year 2024, remains a persistent challenge in the competitive semiconductor market.
Operating expenses saw slight fluctuations, with R&D increasing modestly due to compensation and prototyping efforts, while SG&A decreased sequentially but increased year-over-year for the nine-month period, reflecting investments in sales channels and administrative functions alongside cost control measures.
Breaking down the revenue by end market reveals key drivers.
The Computing segment, representing 47.9% of total revenue, saw a robust 14.8% year-over-year increase and a 3.6% sequential increase, outperforming typical seasonality.
This strength was primarily attributed to better-than-expected demand in tablets, which nearly doubled year-over-year and reached a quarterly record, driven by market share gains and some demand pull-ins.
Robust demand for graphics and AI accelerated cards also contributed significantly, linked to a key customer's next-generation platform ramp.
The Power Supply and Industrial segment also demonstrated strong year-over-year growth, up

32.4%, reaching 19.9% of revenue, fueled by e-mobility and quick chargers. Conversely, the Consumer segment declined 9% year-over-year and 4.9% sequentially (13.0% of revenue), impacted by seasonality and a pullback in wearables. Communications saw a modest 5.8% year-over-year increase but a 14.4% sequential decline (17.2% of revenue), primarily due to typical seasonality from a Tier 1 U.S. smartphone customer.

Liquidity remains a focus. As of March 31, 2025, AOSL held $169.4 million in cash and cash equivalents.

Operating cash flow saw a significant improvement in the nine months ended March 31, 2025, providing $32.5 million, compared to $18.6 million in the prior year period, despite a higher net loss. This was driven by favorable changes in working capital, including decreased inventory purchases and increased accounts payable. Capital expenditures for the nine months totaled $22.8 million, with guidance for $12 million to $14 million in Q4 2025, aligning with a calendar year target of $40 million to $50 million (6-8% of revenue) to support ongoing operational needs and strategic investments like the Oregon fab expansion.

The company's debt structure includes a $7.2 million balance on machinery financing and a $22.5 million balance on the Oregon fab term loan, with management stating compliance with associated covenants. Overall, the company believes its current liquidity is sufficient for the next twelve months, though future growth initiatives may necessitate additional financing.

AOSL's narrative is increasingly defined by its strategic pivot towards becoming a total solutions provider, leveraging its technological prowess to capture higher value within electronic systems. This strategy is most evident in its pursuit of opportunities in advanced computing and AI. Building on its established presence in graphics cards, AOSL is now actively targeting AI accelerator cards and data center applications. The company has secured a design win with a premier customer in a data center application, featuring a notable increase in BOM content by providing both multi-phase controllers and multiple power stages per GPU. Volume production for this program commenced in Q3 2025 and is expected to continue ramping. This represents a significant step up from traditional graphics card content, which could range from $7-$15 to over $20 per GPU on the new platforms, compared to $5-$6 previously, depending on the GPU's power level. The ability to offer the controller alongside the power stages is a direct result of the company's investment in developing intelligent ICs and integrated solutions.

In the Communications segment, AOSL has established itself as a leader in smartphone battery Power Management ICs (PMICs), particularly in battery protection circuits (PCM). The company believes it is the industry leader in smartphone battery PCM. This position is being leveraged as smartphone manufacturers move towards higher charging currents, which necessitates more sophisticated power management solutions and drives increased BOM content for AOSL. The company's hybrid manufacturing model, including the Oregon Fab and its equity method investment in the China JV (now at 39.2% ownership), provides operational flexibility and capacity support for these strategic initiatives. While the reduction in JV ownership was aimed at facilitating the JV's capital raising and potential STAR Market listing, the JV remains committed to providing AOSL with a specified level of monthly wafer production capacity, which is crucial for scaling production of new, high-volume products.

Technological differentiation remains a core competitive moat. AOSL's development of advanced MOSFET platforms, integrated power stages, and now multi-phase controllers are central to its ability to offer higher-performance, more efficient power management solutions. While specific, quantifiable performance metrics for all technologies were not detailed beyond general benefits like improved efficiency and thermal performance, the successful design wins and increased BOM content in demanding applications like AI accelerators serve as tangible evidence of the value these technologies provide to customers. The company's R&D efforts are focused on accelerating new product introductions to counter ASP erosion and target higher-value sockets, aiming to reset pricing and improve product mix over time.

Looking ahead, AOSL's outlook for the June quarter (Fiscal Q4 2025) reflects cautious optimism, building on the signs of recovery seen in Q3. Management guided for revenue of approximately $170 million, plus or minus $10 million. This represents expected low to mid single-digit sequential growth. Excluding the impact of the discontinued licensing revenue (which contributed $2.8 million in Q3 2025), the core product revenue is expected to see mid to upper single-digit sequential growth. This anticipated increase is primarily driven by continued strength in the Computing segment (fueled by PC-related pull-ins and the ramp of graphics cards) and a significant sequential rebound expected in the Consumer segment (driven by gaming and home appliances pull-ins). Gross margins are also expected to see a recovery in Q4 2025, with non-GAAP guidance at approximately 24%, plus or minus 1%. This would bring margins closer to the December quarter level, supported by improved factory utilization rates as revenue increases and a richer product mix resulting from the growth in higher-value segments like AI/graphics.

However, the broader visibility for the second half of calendar year 2025 remains limited, primarily due to macroeconomic uncertainties and evolving geopolitical and trade policies. Management acknowledged that while inventory corrections are largely complete and seasonality is returning, the overall market environment remains dynamic. Key risks highlighted include the potential impact of trade policies and tariffs. While direct tariff exposure is currently minimal due to limited U.S. shipments, the company is actively supporting customers navigating supply chain complexities. A notable risk is the ongoing Department of Commerce (DOC) investigation regarding certain transactions. As of April 16, 2025, the company received a letter with allegations of administrative violations of export control regulations. Discussions with the DOC are ongoing, and AOSL is currently unable to determine the outcome.
