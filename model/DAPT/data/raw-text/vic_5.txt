Description
I believe Six has traded off for two reasons.  1)  Consumer demand fears which we believe are unfounded  2)  Extremely poor start to 2025 weather.  This creates a highly attractive entry into a stock w enormous potential.  Should the weather mean revert, I foresee substantial short covering.  then, should they execute on 2025, we should see a material rerate given the potential.  If so, we could exit 2025 at $55-60/shr - massive upside.  In fairness, weather could mean a modest miss to 2025, but immaterial in the broader scheme of things.  Should demand response bounce, we believe the market will look more optimistically at the massive potential.  Long-term, we believe this could be a fantastic compounder as the new and fantastic management prosecutes the enormous opportunity.
Company Overview
Six Flags Entertainment Corporation, trading under the ticker "FUN," emerged from the merger of Six Flags and Cedar Fair on July 1, 2024. This union created the largest amusement park operator in North America, with a portfolio of 42 parks across the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. At $35/share, FUN has a $3.6bn market capitalization and $9.2bn TEV. We will refer to the legacy Six Flags and Cedar Fair assets throughout this write-up.  Importantly, the Cedar Fair management team took over control of operations, casting aside a lackluster bunch from the legacy Six Flags. 
Investment Thesis
1. Highly attractive, growing industry with material barriers to entry
2. Material under-earning at legacy SIX flags due to mismanagement & capital constraints
3. Merger synergies
4.  Not consumer cyclical
5.  Undervalued due to legacy and short-term concerns
1. Highly attractive growing industry with material barriers to entry
Six Flags operates in a highly attractive industry with substantial barriers to entry.  Most theme parks that exist today were built 50-75 years ago. Outside of the Orlando and LA markets, we believe there hasn’t been a theme park built since the 1980s, but dozens have been closed.  Each year, demand ebbs higher at a low-single digit pace.
Six Flags’ barriers to entry grow each year, supported by rising land costs near major urban centers, increasingly restrictive permitting processes, the spread of NIMBYism, and persistent construction and materials inflation. Thus, it is extraordinarily difficult—if not impossible—to replicate Six Flags’ asset base. In today’s environment, owning a well-located, fully permitted theme park is effectively a license to print money.
This structural moat helps explain how legacy Six Flags operated in such a lackluster manner for decades, yet remained free cash flow positive at the park level. Consumers have few viable alternatives.
We estimate that recreating SIX would require 5–10 years and $20–30 billion. To justify such an investment, a new operator would need to generate $3–5 billion in EBITDA, versus SIX’s current 2025 expectations of ~$1.1 billion. Even assuming higher potential returns from completely new parks, the risk/reward has been a material impediment to supply. Moreover, suitable land parcels in key markets are increasingly scarce.  We don't believe that this barrier to entry provides the "right" to earn $3-5 billion of EBITDA.  Howvever, it provides an enormous protection from disruption while while they revitalize the business to reach its potential. 
If consumer demand continues to rise and Six Flags successfully delivers a high-quality guest experience, supply constraints should drive pricing power and operating leverage. The result is materially higher earnings from a base that cannot be easily duplicated.
2. Material under-earning at legacy SIX flags due to mismanagement & capital constraints
A brief history is essential to fully grasp the extent of the challenges at legacy Six Flags.  Prior to the merger, Six Flags’ assets were significantly underperforming due to decades of mismanagement and heavy debt burden. The company cycled through a series of ineffective leadership teams—many lacking theme park experience—who, under constant pressure to deliver short-term results and capital constrained, repeatedly underinvested in the parks. This pattern of neglect began in the 1990s and persisted through 2023. 
Legacy Six Flags entered the 2007–2009 financial crisis burdened with 10x leverage and ultimately filed for bankruptcy in 2009, extending the under-investment until BK exit in 2011.  Upon exit with a cleaner balance sheet, they had some capital to invest which produced a modest rebound. Still, the company’s strategy oscillated aimlessly between value, premium, and middle-market positioning, while park-level management remained weak.
In 2017, believing they had stabilized operations, Six Flags borrowed $1.2 billion to fund a stock buyback. This debt once again constrained capital investment. Shortly afterward, the COVID-19 pandemic hit, and Six Flags cut deep into the muscle and bone of the operation to survive.  As consumer demand returned with a vengeance, management made a stupendous error by raising prices on a park portfolio in complete disarray. This alienated customers as the value proposition imploded. Guests returned to find rundown parks, broken rides, unsanitary conditions, and subpar food—leaving many to ask: “Why pay to spend the day in a dirty park with long lines and no service?  I should just go to the beach!”
As a result, legacy Six Flags parks have yet to recover their 2019 attendance levels and still miss 10 million visits annually on a 22mm visitation run-rate. Per-capita guest revenue at these parks lags significantly, averaging $85 per day versus $115 at legacy Cedar Fair parks. In a competitive market with lower barriers to entry, a management team like Legacy Cedar Fair would have built a superior theme park near Legacy Six Flags and destroyed this business.
By contrast, legacy Cedar Fair was led by a management team with a long-term focus, consistently reinvesting to build a virtuous flywheel around the guest experience. The parks are clean and thoughtfully maintained, with seasonal planting, shaded areas, and well-managed food and beverage operations. Cedar Fair employed digital tools, allowing guests to enter the park, pay for parking, and order food via mobile app. and actively listened to feedback to guide improvements. For instance, Cedar Fair learned that if food quality is poor, Gen Z won’t attend. It’s not that they’ll eat elsewhere before or after their visit, they won’t attend.
Cedar Fair also maintained a clear and consistent brand position—whether value or premium—so guests knew what to expect. Marketing efforts have been modernized with loyalty programs and CRM tools, while maintenance capex has consistently upgraded attractions. The result: new rides drive incremental attendance and operate more reliably, reducing wait times and costs while significantly improving customer satisfaction.
We see five interrelated components to the legacy Six Flags parks opportunity:
Attendance Recovery. Legacy Six Flags annual attendance is running 10M below its 2019 peak.  We believe the company can recoup at least 7 million of these lost customers by 2028. This would drive a more than a 20% revenue uplift on 2024 consolidated revenue, at roughly 50% drop through margins.  We also believe that Legacy Six was far from optimized in 2019.  Since 2019, Legacy Cedar Fair has proven the ability to greatly expand the season into Halloween and the Holidays.  We suspect that the true opportunity is closer to 15mm visitations.  The incremental margin of this revenue is extremely high, likely exceeding 50%.
Reinvigorated Capital Investment Strategy. From 2015 to 2023 (excluding the pandemic-disrupted year of 2020), Six Flags consistently underinvested in its asset base, allocating just 9.75% of revenue to CapEx, compared to 13.0% for Cedar Fair (FUN) and nearly 15.0% for United Parks and Resorts (PRKS). On a per-park basis, the disparity is even more pronounced: Six Flags averaged only $6 million in annual CapEx per park, while FUN and PRKS invested $16 million and $15 million, respectively. This historical underinvestment left parks dated and undermined attendance growth.
Cedar Fair’s management recognizes that new attractions are the primary lever for driving visitation, while clean, well-maintained parks with strong F&B offerings are essential for sustaining it. Under this leadership, the combined entity now has a clear and disciplined plan to elevate the guest experience through targeted, high-impact CapEx, reversing years of stagnation at legacy Six Flags properties.
Drive Pricing Power. There is currently a $15-20 revenue per capita disparity between Six Flags and Cedar Fair parks. As attendance recovers from an improved guest experience at Six Flags, this could change. Management should begin to evaluate price increases to bridge this per capita gap between the two park networks, which will have high flow through to profitability.
Since the pandemic, Legacy Cedar Fair has aggressively expanded the season with Halloween-oriented park experiences. This has been a huge success, with October weekends becoming the highest attendance weekends of the year.  This has also increased the perceived value of the season pass. While Six Flags began to employ a similar model over the last few years, it was not as effective.
As the parks fill up, they can open more often, expanding the season as more days cover the fixed cost of operations.  This increases season pass value, earnings, and the value proposition of employment opportunities.
The math above is complex because it relates to revenue/visitation due to a season pass. What percent of missing visitations relate to a season pass sale vs. a day pass? However, the above exercise highlights the enormous opportunity at legacy Six Flags in the hands of the right operator. 
In summary, we believe the Legacy Six Flags customer has dropped out of regional theme parks due to egregious mismanagement, but latent demand for extremely cheap entertainment exists.  We believe 15mm visitations are missing and with substantial pricing leverage once the parks fill.  Should new management run these parks in a thoughtful and consistent manner, we believe the demand response will be strong.  We believe that new management has conservatively guided to the $1.5bn of 2028 and progress could present far faster than expected due to the presence of unaddressed need.  Please see our Visitation math on EBITDA at the bottom.  However, we suspect the total opportunity from Improving Legacy SIX Flags is $750-1,000mm of EBITDA.  When combined with synergies/cost saves and continued progress at Legacy Cedar Fair, the opportunity is enormous.
3. Merger synergies
At the time of the merger announcement, management projected $120 million in cost savings from synergies, with the full amount expected to be realized by year-end 2025. Key drivers of these synergies include:
Organizational Streamlining: Beyond eliminating redundant corporate functions, management removed 27 park president roles and implemented a more efficient regional operating structure.
Procurement and Vendor Efficiencies: Leveraging scale by consolidating purchasing across its 42 parks for food, beverage, and merchandise, while also rolling out a unified technology stack spanning ticketing, mobile apps, and CRM systems.
Marketing and Brand Optimization: National brand campaigns and loyalty programs are being unified to improve efficiency and customer engagement.
We thought the initial cost synergy target appeared conservative, and management confirmed our thinking on the Q1 earnings call. Stated cost synergies are tracking ahead of schedule, and the company has identified an additional $60 million in savings expected for FY 2026. As integration continues, we believe further cost-saving opportunities will likely emerge, particularly as management uncovers deeper inefficiencies within the legacy Six Flags operations.
4.  Not consumer cyclical
The market’s overreaction to recession fears, which drove the stock down from $57 to $29, has created a compelling entry opportunity. Two consumer behavior dynamics underly this concern: (i) trade-down and (ii) trade-out. Trade-out reflects consumers exiting discretionary categories entirely due to financial strain, while trade-down captures the shift toward lower-cost alternatives within the same category.
In this case, the trade-out dynamic likely peaked in 2023, particularly among lower-income consumers who have already pulled back from mass-market entertainment options. While further deterioration is possible, much of the impact appears to be behind us. Theme park attendance remains a low-cost, high-value form of entertainment, especially for mid- to upper-income families. Moreover, with approximately 70% of revenue tied to season passes, the model inherently attracts repeat visitors who have already committed financially—making the business more resilient than perceived in a downturn scenario.
The U.S. consumer has been on a post-COVID vacation frenzy that is reversing aggressively. However, the net worth of the core customer remains firm, as do employment trends. We suspect that as the U.S. consumer retrenches on a slimmer spending budget, they might trade down to a theme park. Season passes for a family of four cost $300-360, which seems extremely reasonable. In short, we suspect the trade down outpaces the trade out, and demand remains firm. 
Another supportive consideration, demand dropped 8-9% during the financial crisis. This was a period of extreme unemployment, consumer credit defaults and enormous retrenchment. Given recent spending, consumer trends and improving park operations, we suspect that trade down exceeds trade out in 2025.  YTD season pass sales are tracking 3-5%+.
As you can see from the company’s recent analyst day deck, the company’s primary driver of growth is improved F&B sales.  We suspect their 2028 forecasts are extremely conservative given the presentation was delivered weeks after April 2025’s market collapse.
5.  Undervalued due to legacy
We believe SIX is cheap for the following reasons:
Legacy valuations
Consumer demand fears
Weak start to summer season weather wise
We believe we addressed the consumer demand fears in the passage above.  Most successful regional theme parks trade in the 9-11x EBITDA range, reflecting their attractive ROIC.  SIX came together oddly.  FUN was an MLP that traded poorly due to this structure despite strong results.  SIX was a horribly run, overleveraged asset that floundered and traded horribly.  The initial deal closure was celebrated with a decent multiple, which faded as consumer fears and recent weather hurt the stock.  To be clear, May was a terrible start to the year, weather-wise with wet/rainy weekends.  This could temper upside for 2025 modestly, but the stock’s drop from $39 to $33 is a gross overreaction to the loss of $10-15mm of 1x EBITDA.  That said, we suspect legacy trading ranges are understood by programmatic traders, and in periods of uncertainty, these marginal sellers can drive the stock lower than it should.
Stock price target:
We believe the stock can finish the year in the $55–60 range, implying a multiple of 8–9x 2026E EBITDA—assuming management executes on its plans. This includes: (i) meeting near-term guidance, (ii) monetizing non-core assets, (iii) Generating free cash flow, and (iv) Demonstrating tangible progress in turning around the legacy Six Flags business.
We view the company’s 2028 targets as highly attainable—arguably conservative—and believe this will become increasingly evident as 2026–2027 results begin to inflect. For long-term investors, each passing year should unlock more of the latent potential within the legacy Six Flags asset. Improved attendance and cash flow can support steady reinvestment, reinforcing a virtuous cycle of growth.
While it's difficult to pinpoint the ceiling for EBITDA or FCF, we believe $1.8B+ in EBITDA is achievable by 2030. If that proves correct, this could be a multi-year compounder that deserves to trade at a premium to its historical valuation—not a discount. The results are poised to improve meaningfully; the only questions are how much and how soon.  Should the market come to terms with the recession concerns and start to “buy-in” to the potential here, we suspect the stock can re-rate to a premium given the size of the opportunity at hand.
Risks and Considerations
1. Macroeconomic Challenges
The amusement park industry faces headwinds from economic uncertainties, including inflation and changing consumer spending habits. Such factors could impact attendance and in-park spending.
2. Competitive Pressures
There are no plans in Six Flags’s regions for a new theme park.  There could be a viral outdoor trend that distracts customers, but we believe this risk is extremely muted given the suppressed attendance.  
3. Integration Risks
Post-merger integration presents challenges, including aligning corporate cultures, systems, and operations. Any missteps could hinder the realization of anticipated synergies.
4.  Elevated Capex needs on a fair bit of leverage.  To drive attendance, improve ride-uptime, improve customer satisfaction and reduce OPEX, new rides need to be installed.  Capex will be move toward $500mm for a period and probably only drop to $400mm longer-term.
Conclusion
Six Flags Entertainment Corporation's strategic merger positions it favorably for years of growth with enormous potential.  The recent sell-off has left it with a highly depressed multiple and significantly reduced expectations, creating a unique entry point.  Should these fears be proven wrong, the market can start to price in the potential, creating material near-term upside.  Longer-term, the upside from execution is enormous as well.
