Business Strategy & Outlook (25 Feb 2025)
Mastercard maintains a wide moat and is well-positioned within the global electronic payments infrastructure. Despite ongoing changes in the payment landscape, Mastercard’s role is seen as essential and entrenched. As cash usage continues to decline globally, the trend toward electronic payments still offers significant growth potential. Emerging markets, in particular, are expected to drive additional expansion even as developed markets mature. Mastercard functions as a tollbooth model, earning fees regardless of whether the payment is made via credit, debit, or mobile.

Pandemic-related disruptions to cross-border transactions—a high-margin area—temporarily impacted results, but recovery is now mostly complete. Going forward, Mastercard’s scale and universal acceptance position it to continue outperforming peers and capture global growth.

Business Description
Mastercard is the second-largest payment processor globally, having processed nearly $10 trillion in volume in 2024. It operates in over 200 countries and handles transactions in more than 150 currencies. In the near term, results are expected to normalize to pre-pandemic levels. Economic conditions remain the primary risk, as Mastercard’s revenue is tied to consumer transaction volumes and values. However, secular trends continue to favor electronic payment growth.

Bulls Say (25 Feb 2025)
	•	Mastercard has historically outperformed Visa in growth, and market share normalization may continue this trend.
	•	There is still substantial room for global electronic payment expansion.
	•	Management remains focused on long-term opportunities over short-term margins.

Bears Say (25 Feb 2025)
	•	Mastercard remains a distant #2 to Visa, which may limit long-term margin leverage.
	•	Regulatory scrutiny looms large over this oligopolistic sector.
	•	Governments could favor domestic networks (e.g., UnionPay), limiting Mastercard’s reach in emerging markets.

Economic Moat (25 Feb 2025)
Mastercard’s moat is supported by the powerful network effect: the more users on the network, the more valuable it becomes to merchants and vice versa. This creates a self-reinforcing loop. The company enjoys near-universal acceptance in developed markets. Additionally, the scalable nature of transaction processing provides a cost advantage, reinforcing its dominant position. Mastercard’s roots trace back to the Interbank Card Association and its acquisition of Master Charge in 1969. It has since been a major beneficiary of the shift to digital payments.

Mastercard’s scale, moat, and exposure to high-growth electronic payments position it well to deliver sustained long-term returns. Despite short-term overvaluation and global regulatory risks, its network effect, agnostic business model, and innovation pipeline ensure it remains a core holding in the payments space.

During 2024, Mastercard processed over $8 trillion in purchase transactions. Visa processes roughly twice as many and leads in global market share, but Mastercard holds a strong second with global credit card share estimated at 29% and debit card share at 24%. Mastercard’s global presence enables premium pricing on cross-border transactions, a high-margin area. We believe Mastercard’s dominance in global electronic payments is effectively unassailable. Mastercard’s operating margins using net revenue in 2024 were 58% and have trended upward, supported by a scalable, asset-light model that drives high returns on invested capital. Fair Value and Profit Drivers: Our fair value estimate was raised to $500 per share from $465, reflecting time value and modest changes to assumptions. This implies a 31.6x 2025 projected earnings multiple, excluding one-time expenses. Though revenue fell in 2020 due to COVID-19 and into early 2021, growth quickly rebounded. Mastercard is now expected to return to pre-pandemic growth levels. We project a 12% CAGR in net revenue over the next five years, driven by international market expansion. Profitability has recovered; operating margins based on net revenue are expected to improve from 58% in 2024 to 61% by 2029, about 70 basis points annually. Gross revenue margins will likely remain flat due to increasing client incentives. One-time costs are modeled in line with historical norms but excluded from margin estimates. We use a 9% cost of equity. Risk and Uncertainty: Mastercard receives a Medium Uncertainty Rating. Revenue is highly sensitive to consumer transaction volume, creating macroeconomic exposure. Cross-border payments are especially profitable but depend heavily on travel and online commerce, both economically sensitive. Legal and regulatory risks are embedded in the business model; both Visa and Mastercard have paid significant fines over industry conduct. Merchant dissatisfaction and regulatory scrutiny present ongoing challenges. Despite these risks, Mastercard’s scale, moat, and growth trajectory justify its valuation, and the company remains a cornerstone in global payments infrastructure.
Desires to lower fees. While Visa’s and Mastercard’s positions in the current electronic payment infrastructure are largely set, the payment industry continues to evolve in ways that could reduce their volume or profitability. Some governments have shown a preference for local payment networks, which could freeze Mastercard out of certain markets and impede the value it drives from its global network. We see the company’s largest environmental, social, and governance risk as data security. Any company involved in processing payments has potential exposure to breaches in its systems.

Capital Allocation Brett Horn, CFA, Senior Equity Analyst, 25 Feb 2025
Our Morningstar Capital Allocation Rating for Mastercard is Standard. In our opinion, the company’s balance sheet is sound, its capital investment decisions are fair, and its capital return strategy is appropriate. We have a favorable view of the management team at Mastercard, but we believe the company’s wide moat and positive secular tailwinds have been the dominant factor behind its strong historical results. Ajay Banga served as the company’s CEO from 2010 until the end of 2020. Banga initially moved to the chairman position, but then retired at the end of 2021. Michael Miebach, who has been with the company for over 10 years and previously served as chief product officer, replaced Banga as CEO. We like that Miebach held leadership positions in the company across geographic regions, as we expect the company’s growth to come increasingly from international markets over time. Still, given that the company turned to a company veteran for the CEO role, we didn’t expect any major strategic pivots as a result of this change, and think this view has largely played out. We view staying the course as the right move for Mastercard.
While we attribute the company’s strong historical performance primarily to the wide moat that surrounds the business and secular tailwinds, it is notable that Mastercard has generally outperformed Visa in terms of growth in recent years. This suggests management is effectively exploiting the growth opportunities the company has in front of it. Further, we like that management has been hesitant to commit to operating margin targets over the short term. We believe the company still has significant growth opportunities, and the nature of the business requires reinvestment through the income statement. We think focusing on near-term profitability targets could hamper long-term value creation, and we think management is right to maintain flexibility on this score, although we think the scalability of the business model will allow for margin improvement over time.
While Mastercard has completed some acquisitions, they have generally been small and sporadic. We think the company’s competitive position argues against aggressive M&A, and we are pleased that management has shown discipline in this regard. Management historically has returned essentially all of Mastercard’s profitability to shareholders and continues to do so.

Mastercard Earnings: Growth Picks Up Brett Horn, CFA, Senior Equity Analyst, 30 Jan 2025 Mastercard’s recent results suggested that consumer spending was largely holding steady as impacts from one-time issues started to fade. But fourth-quarter results suggest the environment may be improving a bit. We will maintain our $465 fair value estimate. We see the shares as modestly overvalued. The quarter suggests the near-term outlook may be a little better than we had anticipated, and we think the market is reacting to that, but we believe significant uncertainty still exists on this front. On a constant-currency basis, net revenue grew 16% year over year, up from 14% last quarter. Payment volume grew 11.6% on a constant-currency basis, up from 10.5% in the previous quarter. Management pointed to low unemployment and moderate inflation as supportive of consumer spending. Cross-border volume has been a tailwind for the networks over the past couple of years, as the bounceback in travel from pandemic lows drove outsize growth. That tailwind has been fading in recent quarters, but this quarter bucked the trend. Constant-currency cross-border volume, excluding intra-Europe transactions—which are priced similarly to domestic transactions—grew 20% year over year, up from 17% last quarter. We believe most of the benefit from the travel recovery has been realized, but this quarter suggests there could be further upside. Still, we’d like to see more than one quarter to materially revise our view. Adjusted operating margin improved to 56.3% from 56.2% last year. For the full year, the company saw a 40-basis-point improvement. Margin improvement appears to have slowed, but we don’t read much into near-term margin results, as we think lower margins are often driven by investments for growth. Client incentives grew 17% year over year on a constant-currency basis. We think incentives growing faster than revenue supports our view that Mastercard will not achieve margin improvement on a gross revenue basis over time.

Mastercard Earnings: Settling Into a Groove Brett Horn, CFA, Senior Equity Analyst, 31 Oct 2024 We think Mastercard’s third-quarter earnings largely mirrored what we saw from Visa, although Mastercard appears to be performing a bit better at the margin. In recent quarters, we’ve seen pandemic, political, and macro effects dissipate, and we see this quarter as further evidence of stability. We think Mastercard’s attractive long-term growth prospects and its strong profitability become more clear in this type of situation. We will maintain our $465 fair value estimate for the wide-moat company and see shares as about fairly valued. Constant-currency net revenue increased 14% year over year, a 1-percentage-point improvement from the previous quarter. Payment volume was up 10% constant currency, also up slightly from last quarter. Overall, though, we think results from the networks suggest consumer spending is holding steady. Cross-border volume has been the one area seeing an ongoing tailwind over the past couple of years. But this tailwind has been fading, and this quarter provided further evidence. Constant-currency cross-border volume, excluding intra-Europe transactions—which are priced similarly to domestic transactions—grew 17% year over year in the quarter, down a bit from 18% in the last quarter. While Mastercard is seeing cross-border growth fade at a similar rate as Visa, its absolute growth is higher, suggesting its volumes might not have fully normalized yet. Adjusted operating margins (based on net revenue) improved to 59.3%, compared with 58.8% last year. The rate of margin improvement was in line with what we’ve seen from the company this year and with our long-term expectations. Mastercard is outperforming Visa on this front, but we don’t read much into near-term margin results, as we think lower margins are often driven by investments for growth. Client incentives grew 19% year over year on a constant currency basis, highlighting how margin improvement on a gross revenue basis is a much more difficult task.

Mastercard: Buying Recorded Future for $2.65 Billion Brett Horn, CFA, Senior Equity Analyst, 12 Sep 2024 Mastercard announced that it will acquire Recorded Future for $2.65 billion. Recorded Future is a cyber defense company with 1,900 customers across 75 countries. Mastercard believes the addition of Recorded Future will add to its fraud prevention capabilities. Controlling fraud within its payment networks is an ongoing issue for Mastercard, so investing in this area seems appropriate. Due to its wide moat, we don’t think Mastercard needs to be aggressive in terms of mergers and acquisitions, but smaller deals like this that add certain capabilities make sense, in our view. However, the deal is not large enough to have a material impact on our $465 fair value estimate, which we maintain. We see Mastercard’s shares as fairly valued at the moment. Mastercard Earnings: Results Suggest Consumer Spending Remains Steady Equity Analyst, 31 Jul 2024
While Mastercard’s second-quarter results show many of the same dynamics as Visa, Mastercard appears to be modestly outperforming its peer at the moment. We believe Mastercard has slightly stronger long-term prospects given its smaller size and lower exposure to relatively mature markets. We will maintain our $451 fair value estimate for the wide-moat company and view shares as fairly valued at the moment. Net revenue increased 11% year over year, or 13% on a constant-currency basis. Gross dollar volume rose 9% constant currency, and switched transactions were up 11%. This represented a slight decline from the previous quarter, primarily due to the leap year effect. Overall, while macro conditions remain a key swing factor in the near term, these results suggest consumer spending remains relatively stable. Cross-border volume is particularly lucrative for both Visa and Mastercard, and this quarter offered further evidence. Constant-currency cross-border volume, excluding intra-Europe transactions—priced similarly to domestic ones—grew 18% year over year, down slightly from 19% last quarter. While growth remains healthy and Mastercard continues to modestly outperform Visa, the recovery in cross-border volume increasingly appears largely realized. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter reached 59.4%, up from 58.6% last year. With strong growth, Mastercard appears to benefit from scale advantages. Client incentives increased 16% year over year constant currency. As client incentives return to a historical upward trend, margin improvement on a gross revenue basis will likely be more difficult to achieve.

Visa and Mastercard: Judge May Not Approve Settlement Brett Horn, CFA, Senior Equity Analyst, 14 Jun 2024 In March, Visa and Mastercard announced a settlement to a long-standing antitrust lawsuit. Under the agreement, the networks would slightly lower and cap credit interchange fees for five years. At the time, we welcomed resolution. However, The Wall Street Journal reports the judge informed Visa and Mastercard the changes are inadequate and she is unlikely to approve the settlement. This would likely force renegotiation or trial. While disappointing, Visa and Mastercard’s dominant positions and wide moats carry persistent legal and regulatory risks, and this lawsuit is just one component. We will maintain our $272 and $451 fair value estimates for Visa and Mastercard respectively and view both stocks as fairly valued.

Mastercard Earnings: A Stable Environment Highlights Mastercard’s Strengths Brett Horn, CFA, Senior Equity Analyst, 1 May 2024 Mastercard’s first-quarter results indicate the company is on a steady path and performing in line with peer Visa. After the volatility of the pandemic and recovery, we believe Mastercard is operating in a more stable environment. First-quarter results align with our long-term expectations. We maintain our $451 fair value estimate and wide moat rating and consider shares fairly valued. Net revenue rose 11% year over year constant currency. Gross dollar volume increased 10%, and transactions climbed 13%. Despite ongoing macro uncertainty, consumer spending appears resilient, and the current environment illustrates Mastercard’s solid growth potential supported by favorable long-term secular tailwinds. Cross-border volume, the most volatile area in recent years, now appears to have settled into a more stable rhythm.
Cross-border volume excluding intra-Europe transactions—priced similarly to domestic transactions—grew 19% year over year in the quarter, in line with last quarter. Mastercard appears to be modestly outperforming Visa on this front. Cross-border growth remains slightly above our long-term expectations, but we believe most of the benefit from the travel rebound has been realized. Adjusted operating margins (on a net revenue basis, excluding one-time items) increased to 58.8% from 58.2% last year. With solid growth, the scalability of the business is evident. However, client incentives increased 20% year over year on a constant-currency basis. With pandemic distortions now behind us and incentives climbing again, gross revenue margin improvement will likely prove difficult.
