Mastercard Enjoys a Wide Moat and Strong Growth
ProsPEcts
Business Strategy & Outlook Brett Horn, CFA, Senior Equity Analyst, 25 Feb 2025
Mastercard has multiple characteristics that should draw investors ' attention. FIRSt, despite ongoing
evolution in the payment space, we think a wide moat surrounds the business and view Mastercard ' s
position in the current global electronic payment infrastructure as essentially unassailable. SECond,
Mastercard benefits from the ongoing shift toward electronic payments, which should provide plenty of
opportunities to utilize its wide moat to create value over the long term. Digital payments, on a global
basis, surpassed cash payments just a few years ago, suggesting that this trend still has a lot of room to
run, and we think emerging markets could offer a further leg of growth even as growth in develoPEd
markets starts to slow. Finally, Mastercard is something of a tolLBOoth business, and the company is
relatively agnostic to smaller shifts within the electronic payment space, as it earns fees regardless of

Mastercard has faced some volatility over the past few years. Cross-border transactions, which are
particularly lucrative for the networks, came under heavy pressure due to the fallout from the pandemic
and a reduction in global travel. We exPEcted a full recovery, and we believe that has largely played out.
Although the ongoing bounceback remains a modest tailwind, we think the benefit is now mostly
realized. From a longer-term point of view, we think it is likely that smaller and more regional networks

Bulls Say Brett Horn, CFA, Senior Equity Analyst, 25 Feb 2025
u Mastercard historically has outPErformed Visa in terms of growth. Its smaller size and some leveling in
market share between the two could maintain this trend.
u There is still plenty of runway for growth in electronic payments. Electronic payments only surpassed
cash payments on a global basis a few years ago.
u Management is appropriately focused on long-term growth opportunities and not near-term margins.
Bears Say Brett Horn, CFA, Senior Equity Analyst, 25 Feb 2025
u Mastercard is a distant number-two player in a scalable industry, which could hamPEr long-term
margins.
u The oligopolistic nature of the industry makes Visa and Mastercard a target for regulators, and the
companies have historically paid some large fines.
u UnionPay provides an example of how governments could favor local networks, and this could shut

Economic Moat Brett Horn, CFA, Senior Equity Analyst, 25 Feb 2025
Payment networks such as Mastercard benefit, unsurprisingly, from a network effect. The more
consumers that are plugged into a payment network, the more attractive that payment network
becomes for merchants, which, in turn, makes the network more convenient for consumers and so on.
In our view, this dynamic explains why a handful of networks have come to dominate electronic
payments over time, and at this point, Mastercard has reached essentially universal acceptance in most
develoPEd markets. While the network effect is the initial and primary driver of economic moats in the
space, the highly scalable nature of payment processing leads to sizable cost advantages for large
payment networks, which further cements their comPEtitive positions. For the dominant payment
networks with global footprints, such as Mastercard, the network effect and resulting cost advantage is
strong enough to lead to a wide moat, in our view.
Mastercard ' s origin lies in the formation of the Interbank Card Association by a group of banks that
acquired Master Charge in 1969 and adopted the company ' s current logo. In the decades since,
Mastercard has been one of the largest beneficiaries of the ongoing shift toward using electronic

payments. During 2024, the company processed over $8 trillion in purchase transactions. Visa,
meanwhile, processes roughly twice as many transactions as Mastercard and leads it in terms of market
share in every major global region. However, Mastercard has a similarly commanding lead over any
other network and is the only other company with a truly global presence. Mastercard ' s global market
share for credit and dEBIT cards has been estimated at 29% and 24%, resPEctively, a level that dwarfs
comPEtitors outside of Visa. Mastercard may face some comPEtition in processing domestic
transactions, but we think the company ' s global presence is a relatively unique asset that allows the
company to process cross-border transactions and charge materially higher fees in this area. We don ' t
believe that building a new network with a comparable size and reach is realistic over any foreseeable
time line and view Mastercard ' s position within the current global electronic payment infrastructure as
essentially unassailable.
Mastercard has translated its dominant comPEtitive position into an enviable level of profitability.

OPErating margins (using net revenue) in 2024 were 58%, and margins have generally trended upward
over time due to the scalability of the business. Further, given the relatively asset-light nature of the
business, returns on invested capital are multiple above any reasonable estimate of the cost of capital.
Fair Value and Profit Drivers Brett Horn, CFA, Senior Equity Analyst, 25 Feb 2025
We are increasing our fair value estimate for Mastercard to $500 PEr share from $465, due to time value
since our last update and some modest changes to our assumptions. Our new fair value estimate
equates to 31.6 times projected 2025 earnings, adjusted for one-time exPEnses.
While revenue declined in 2020 due to the coronavirus and that issue bled into the start of 2021, growth
bounced back quickly and Mastercard has enjoyed outsize growth the past few years. We think
conditions have now normalized and we exPEct a return to growth levels more in line with the
prepandemic PEriod. We think SECular trends and improving share should allow Mastercard to maintain
strong growth rates over the next five years. We project net revenue to grow at a 12% compound
annual growth rate. We think growth will be increasingly fueled by international markets, and
Mastercard's mix leaves it relatively well-positioned.
While margins were materially pressured in 2020, profitability has recovered since, and margins (based
on net revenue) are now slightly ahead of the prepandemic level. In the future, we exPEct oPErating
margins (based on net revenue) to improve from 58% in 2024 to 61% by 2029, based on the scalability of
the business. This equates to an annual average improvement of about 70 basis points. On a gross
revenue basis, we exPEct increasing client incentives to result in basically flat margins over the
projection PEriod. Given the company ' s history of fines and one-time charges, we include ongoing onetime costs roughly in line with historical averages in our projections, but these costs are excluded from
the margin levels above.
We use a cost of equity of 9%.
Risk and Uncertainty Brett Horn, CFA, Senior Equity Analyst, 25 Feb 2025
We assign Mastercard a Medium Morningstar Uncertainty Rating.
Mastercard ' s revenue is tied to the amount and volume of consumer purchases, which creates
significant macROEconomic sensitivity. Cross-border transactions are highly lucrative for Mastercard,
making the company particularly sensitive to any swings in these tyPEs of transactions. Cross-border
transactions are disproportionally tied to travel and online transactions, both of which tend to be
sensitive to macROEcnomic conditions.
Both Visa and Mastercard have paid substantial fines historically related to the oligopolistic nature of
the industry, and we see legal and regulatory risk as intrinsic to the business model, given merchants '

desires to lower fees.
While Visa's and Mastercard ' s positions in the current electronic payment infrastructure are largely set,
the payment industry continues to evolve in ways that could reduce their volume or profitability. Some
governments have shown a preference for local payment networks, which could freeze Mastercard out
of certain markets and imPEde the value it drives from its global network.
We see the company's largest environmental, social, and governance risk as data SECurity. Any
company involved in processing payments has potential exposure to breaches in its systems.
Capital Allocation Brett Horn, CFA, Senior Equity Analyst, 25 Feb 2025
Our Morningstar Capital Allocation Rating for Mastercard is Standard. In our opinion, the company ' s
balance sheet is sound, its capital investment decisions are fair, and its capital return strategy is
appropriate. We have a favorable view of the management team at Mastercard, but we believe the
company's wide moat and positive SECular tailwinds have been the dominant factor behind its strong
historical results.
Ajay Banga served as the company ' s CEO from 2010 until the end of 2020. Banga initially moved to the
chairman position, but then retired at the end of 2021. Michael Miebach, who has been with the
company for over 10 years and previously served as chief product officer, replaced Banga as CEO. We
like that Miebach held leadership positions in the company across geographic regions, as we exPEct the
company ' s growth to come increasingly from international markets over time. Still, given that the
company turned to a company veteran for the CEO role, we didn ' t exPEct any major strategic pivots as a
result of this change, and think this view has largely played out. We view staying the course as the right
move for Mastercard.
While we attribute the company ' s strong historical PErformance primarily to the wide moat that
surrounds the business and SECular tailwinds, it is notable that Mastercard has generally outPErformed
Visa in terms of growth in recent years. This suggests management is effectively exploiting the growth
opportunities the company has in front of it. Further, we like that management has been hesitant to
commit to oPErating margin targets over the short term. We believe the company still has significant
growth opportunities, and the nature of the business requires reinvestment through the income
statement. We think focusing on near-term profitability targets could hamPEr long-term value creation,
and we think management is right to maintain flexibility on this score, although we think the scalability
of the business model will allow for margin improvement over time.
While Mastercard has completed some acquisitions, they have generally been small and sporadic. We
think the company ' s comPEtitive position argues against aggressive M&A, and we are pleased that
management has shown discipline in this regard.
Management historically has returned essentially all of Mastercard ' s profitability to shareholders and

Mastercard Earnings: Growth Picks Up Brett Horn, CFA,Senior Equity Analyst,30 Jan 2025
Mastercard ' s recent results suggested that consumer sPEnding was largely holding steady as impacts
from one-time issues started to fade. But fourth-quarter results suggest the environment may be
improving a bit. We will maintain our $465 fair value estimate. We see the shares as modestly
overvalued. The quarter suggests the near-term outlook may be a little better than we had anticipated,
and we think the market is reacting to that, but we believe significant uncertainty still exists on this
front.On a constant-currency basis, net revenue grew 16% year over year, up from 14% last quarter.
Payment volume grew 11.6% on a constant-currency basis, up from 10.5% in the previous quarter.
Management pointed to low unemployment and moderate inflation as supportive of consumer
sPEnding.Cross-border volume has been a tailwind for the networks over the past couple of years, as
the bounceback in travel from pandemic lows drove outsize growth. That tailwind has been fading in
recent quarters, but this quarter bucked the trend. Constant-currency cross-border volume, excluding
intra-EuroPE transactions -- which are priced similarly to domestic transactions -- grew 20% year over
year, up from 17% last quarter. We believe most of the benefit from the travel recovery has been
realized, but this quarter suggests there could be further upside. Still, we ' d like to see more than one
quarter to materially revise our view.Adjusted oPErating margin improved to 56.3% from 56.2% last year.
For the full year, the company saw a 40-basis-point improvement. Margin improvement apPEars to have
slowed, but we don ' t read much into near-term margin results, as we think lower margins are often
driven by investments for growth. Client incentives grew 17% year over year on a constant-currency
basis. We think incentives growing faster than revenue supports our view that Mastercard will not
achieve margin improvement on a gross revenue basis over time.
Mastercard Earnings: Settling Into a Groove Brett Horn, CFA,Senior Equity Analyst,31 Oct 2024
We think Mastercard ' s third-quarter earnings largely mIRRored what we saw from Visa, although
Mastercard apPEars to be PErforming a bit better at the margin. In recent quarters, we ' ve seen
pandemic, political, and macro effects dissipate, and we see this quarter as further evidence of stability.
We think Mastercard ' s attractive long-term growth prosPEcts and its strong profitability become more
clear in this tyPE of situation. We will maintain our $465 fair value estimate for the wide-moat company
and see shares as about fairly valued.Constant currency net revenue increased 14% year over year, a 1PErcentage-point improvement from the previous quarter. Payment volume was up 10% constant
currency, also up slightly from last quarter. Overall, though, we think results from the networks suggest

consumer sPEnding is holding steady.Cross-border volume has been the one area seeing an ongoing
tailwind over the past couple of years. But this tailwind has been fading, and this quarter provided
further evidence. Constant-currency cross-border volume, excluding intra-EuroPE transactions -- which
are priced similarly to domestic transactions -- grew 17% year over year in the quarter, down a bit from
18% in the last quarter. While Mastercard is seeing cross-border growth fade at a similar rate as Visa,
its ABSolute growth is higher, suggesting its volumes might not have fully normalized yet.Adjusted
oPErating margins (based on net revenue) improved to 59.3%, compared with 58.8% last year. The rate
of margin improvement was in line with what we ' ve seen from the company this year and with our
long-term exPEctations. Mastercard is outPErforming Visa on this front, but we don ' t read much into
near-term margin results, as we think lower margins are often driven by investments for growth. Client
incentives grew 19% year over year on a constant currency basis, highlighting how margin improvement
on a gross revenue basis is a much more difficult task.
Mastercard: Buying Recorded Future for $2.65 Billion Brett Horn, CFA,Senior Equity Analyst,12 Sep
2024
Mastercard announced that it will acquire Recorded Future for $2.65 billion. Recorded Future is a cyber
defense company with 1,900 customers across 75 countries. Mastercard believes the addition of
Recorded Future will add to its fraud prevention capabilities. Controlling fraud within its payment
networks is an ongoing issue for Mastercard, so investing in this area seems appropriate. Due to its
wide moat, we don ' t think Mastercard needs to be aggressive in terms of mergers and acquisitions, but
smaller deals like this that add certain capabilities make sense, in our view. However, the deal is not
large enough to have a material impact on our $465 fair value estimate, which we maintain. We see
Mastercard ' s shares as fairly valued at the MoMent.
Mastercard Earnings: Results Suggest Consumer SPEnding Remains Steady 
Equity Analyst,31 Jul 2024
While Mastercard ' s SECond-quarter results show many of the same dynamics we saw from Visa,
Mastercard apPEars to be modestly outPErforming its PEer at the MoMent. We continue to believe that
Mastercard has slightly stronger long-term prosPEcts given its smaller size and lower exposure to
relatively mature markets. We will maintain our $451 fair value estimate for the wide-moat company
and see shares as fairly valued at the MoMent.Net revenue increased 11% year over year, or 13% on a
constant-currency basis. Gross dollar volume was up 9% on a constant-currency basis, and switched
transactions were up 11%. This represented a slight decline from the previous quarter, but this apPEars
to be mainly due to the inclusion of leap year last quarter. Overall, while we think macro conditions
remain the biggest potential swing factor in the near term, these results suggest that consumer
sPEnding remains relatively stable for now.Cross-border volume is particularly lucrative for Mastercard

for both Visa and Mastercard, and this quarter provided further evidence. Constant-currency crossborder volume, excluding intra-EuroPE transactions -- which are priced similarly to domestic
transactions -- grew 18% year over year in the quarter, down slightly from 19% in the last quarter. While
growth in this area is still healthy and Mastercard is modestly outPErforming Visa, the recovery in crossborder volume increasingly looks to be largely realized.Adjusted oPErating margin for the quarter was
59.4% compared with 58.6% last year. With Mastercard seeing relatively strong growth, it apPEars to be
benefiting from some scale benefits. Client incentives increased 16% year over year on a constantcurrency basis. With client incentives resuming their historical upward path, margin improvement on a
gross revenue basis will likely be harder to realize.
Visa and Mastercard: Judge May Not Approve Settlement Brett Horn, CFA,Senior Equity Analyst,14
Jun 2024
In March, Visa and Mastercard announced that they had reached a settlement to a long-standing
antitrust lawsuit. As part of the agreement, the networks would slightly lower credit interchange fees
and cap these fees at the current level for five years. At the time, we were happy to see this lawsuit
seemingly resolved. But according to The Wall Street Journal, the judge has now informed Visa and
Mastercard that she deems these changes inadequate and is unlikely to approve the settlement. This
would presumably force the networks to arrange a new settlement or go to trial. While this is an
obvious setback and we would prefer to see this matter closed as quickly as possible, we believe Visa
and Mastercard ' s unique comPEtitive positions and their wide moats create ongoing legal and
regulatory event risk, and this lawsuit represents just one piece of that. We will maintain our $272 and
$451 fair value estimates for Visa and Mastercard, resPEctively, and see shares for both companies as
about fairly valued.
Mastercard Earnings: A Stable Environment Highlights Mastercard' s Strengths Brett Horn,
CFA,Senior Equity Analyst,1 May 2024
Mastercard ' s fIRSt-quarter results show that the company is on a steady path and PErforming roughly in
line with its PEer Visa. Following the dramatic ups and downs of the pandemic and the ensuing
recovery, we think Mastercard has settled into a more stable environment, and the company ' s fIRStquarter results are largely in line with our long-term exPEctations. We will maintain our $451 fair value
estimate and wide moat rating, and we consider shares fairly valued at the MoMent.Net revenue was
up 11% year over year on a constant-currency basis. Gross dollar volume increased 10% on a constantcurrency basis, and transactions were up 13%. While macro uncertainty exists, consumer sPEnding
apPEars to be holding for now, and we think the current environment highlights the solid growth the
company can achieve over time, given favorable long-term SECular tailwinds.Cross-border volume, which
has been the most volatile area over the past few years, has now settled into a more stable groove.

to domestic transactions -- grew 19% year over year in the quarter, in line with the last quarter.
Mastercard apPEars to be modestly outPErforming Visa on this front. Cross-border growth is still a bit
above our long-term exPEctations, but we think most of the benefit from the bounceback in travel has
been realized.Adjusted oPErating margins (on a net revenue basis and excluding one-time items)
increased to 58.8% from 58.2% last year. With solid growth, we think the scalability of the business is
showing through. However, client incentives increased 20% year over year on a constant-currency basis.
With incentives increasing again now that pandemic-related distortions have rolled off, margin
improvement on a gross revenue basis will be much harder to come by.

Research Methodology for Valuing Companies
Overview
At the heart of our valuation system is a detailed projection of a company's future cash flows, resulting from our
analysts' research. Analysts create custom industry and
company assumptions to feed income statement, balance
sheet, and capital investment assumptions into our globally standardized, proprietary discounted cash flow, or
DCF, modeling templates. We use scenario analysis, indepth comPEtitive advantage analysis, and a variety of other
analytical tools to augment this process. Moreover, we
think analyzing valuation through discounted cash flows
presents a better lens for viewing cyclical companies,
high-growth firms, businesses with finite lives (e.g.,
mines), or companies exPEcted to generate negative
earnings over the next few years. That said, we don't dismiss multiples altogether but rather use them as supporting cross-checks for our DCF-based fair value estimates.
We also acknowledge that DCF models offer their own
challenges (including a potential proliferation of estimated inputs and the possibility that the method may miss
shortterm market-price movements), but we believe these
negatives are mitigated by deep analysis and our
longterm appROAch.
Morningstar's equity research group ("we," "our") believes that a company's intrinsic worth results from the
future cash flows it can generate. The Morningstar Rating
for stocks identifies stocks trading at a discount or premium to their intrinsic worth--or fair value estimate, in
Morningstar terminology. Five-star stocks sell for the
biggest risk adjusted discount to their fair values, whereas 1-star stocks trade at premiums to their intrinsic worth.
Four key components drive the Morningstar rating: (1) our
assessment of the firm's economic moat, (2) our estimate
of the stock's fair value, (3) our uncertainty around that
fair value estimate and (4) the current market price. This
process ultimately culminates in our singlepoint star rating.
turns on invested capital (or ROIC) over and above our estimate of a firm's cost of capital, or weighted average
cost of capital (or WACC). Without a moat, profits are
more susceptible to comPEtition. We have identified five
sources of economic moats: intangible assets, switching
costs, network effect, cost advantage, and efficient scale.
Companies with a narrow moat are those we believe are
more likely than not to achieve normalized excess returns
for at least the next 10 years. Wide-moat companies are
those in which we have very high confidence that excess
returns will remain for 10 years, with excess returns more
likely than not to remain for at least 20 years. The longer
a firm generates economic profits, the higher its intrinsic
value. We believe low-quality, no-moat companies will
see their normalized returns gravitate toward the firm ' s
cost of capital more quickly than companies with moats.
When considering a company's moat, we also assess
whether there is a substantial threat of value destruction,
stemming from risks related to ESG, industry disruption,
financial health, or other idiosyncratic issues. In this context, a risk is considered potentially value destructive if its
occurrence would eliminate a firm ' s economic profit on a
cumulative or midcycle basis. If we deem the probability
of occurrence sufficiently high, we would not characterize
the company as possessing an economic moat.
2. Estimated Fair Value
Combining our analysts ' financial forecasts with the
firm ' s economic moat helps us assess how long returns
on invested capital are likely to exceed the firm ' s cost of
capital. Returns of firms with a wide economic moat rating are assumed to fade to the PErPEtuity PEriod over a
longer PEriod of time than the returns of narrow-moat
firms, and both will fade slower than no-moat firms, increasing our estimate of their intrinsic value.
Our model is divided into three distinct stages:
1. Economic Moat
Stage I: Explicit Forecast
The concept of an economic moat plays a vital role not
only in our qualitative assessment of a firm's long-term
investment potential, but also in the actual calculation of
our fair value estimates. An economic moat is a structural
feature that allows a firm to sustain excess profits over a
long PEriod of time. We define economic profits as reIn this stage, which can last five to 10 years, analysts
make full financial statement forecasts, including items
such as revenue, profit margins, tax rates, changes in
workingcapital accounts, and capital sPEnding. Based on
these projections, we calculate earnings before interest,
after taxes (EBI) and the net new investment (NNI) to deMorningstar Equity Research Star Rating Methodology
rive our annual free cash flow forecast.
Stage II: Fade
The SECond stage of our model is the PEriod it will take
the company ' s return on new invested capital -- the return on capital of the next dollar invested ( " RONIC " ) -- to
decline (or rise) to its cost of capital. During the Stage II
PEriod, we use a formula to approximate cash flows in
lieu of explicitly modeling the income statement, balance
sheet, and cash flow statement as we do in Stage I. The
length of the SECond stage dePEnds on the strength of
the company ' s economic moat. We forecast this PEriod to
last anywhere from one year (for companies with no economic moat) to 10 - 15 years or more (for wide-moat companies). During this PEriod, cash flows are forecast using
four assumptions: an average growth rate for EBI over the
PEriod, a normalized investment rate, average return on
new invested capital (RONIC), and the number of years
until PErPEtuity, when excess returns cease. The investment rate and return on new invested capital decline until a PErPEtuity value is calculated. In the case of firms
that do not earn their cost of capital, we assume marginal
ROICs rise to the firm ' s cost of capital (usually attributable to less reinvestment), and we may truncate the
SECond stage.
Stage III: PErPEtuity
Once a company ' s marginal ROIC hits its cost of capital,
we calculate a continuing value, using a standard PErPEtuity formula. At PErPEtuity, we assume that any
growth or decline or investment in the business neither
creates nor destroys value and that any new investment
provides a return in line with estimated WACC.
Because a dollar earned today is worth more than a dollar
earned tomorrow, we discount our projections of cash
flows in stages I, II, and III to arrive at a total present
value of exPEcted future cash flows. Because we are
modeling free cash flow to the firm -- representing cash
available to provide a return to all capital providers -- we
discount future cash flows using the WACC, which is a
weighted average of the costs of equity, debt, and preferred stock (and any other funding sources), using exPEcted future proportionate long-term, market-value
weights.
3. Uncertainty Around That Fair Value Estimate
Morningstar ' s Uncertainty Rating is designed to capture
the range of potential outcomes for a company ' s intrinsic
value. This rating is used to assign the margin of safety
required before investing, which in turn explicitly drives
our stock star rating system. The Uncertainty Rating is
aimed at identiFYing the confidence we should have in assigning a fair value estimate for a given stock.
Our Uncertainty Rating is meant to take into account anything that can increase the potential disPErsion of future
outcomes for the intrinsic value of a company, and any-

Research Methodology for Valuing Companies
thing that can affect our ability to accurately predict
these outcomes. The rating begins with a suggested rating produced by a quantitative process based on the trailing 12-month standard deviation of daily stock returns.
An analyst overlay is then applied, with analysts using
the suggested rating, historical rating data, and their own
knowledge of the company to inform them as they make
the final Uncertainty Rating decision. Ultimately, the rating decision rests with the analyst. Analysts take into account many characteristics when making their final decision, including cyclical factors, oPErational and financial
factors such as leverage, company-sPEcific events, ESG
risks, and anything else that might increase the potential
disPErsion of future outcomes and our ability to estimate
those outcomes.
Our recommended margin of safety--the discount to fair
value demanded before we'd recommend buying or
selling the stock--widens as our uncertainty of the estimated value of the equity increases. The more uncertain
we are about the potential disPErsion of outcomes, the
greater the discount we require relative to our estimate of
the value of the firm before we would recommend the
purchase of the shares. In addition, the Uncertainty Rating provides guidance in portfolio construction based on
risk tolerance.
Our Uncertainty Ratings are: Low, Medium, High, Very
High, and Extreme.

Our uncertainty rating is based on the interquartile range,
or the middle 50% of potential outcomes, covering the
25th PErcentile-75th PErcentile. This means that when a
stock hits 5 stars, we exPEct there is a 75% chance that
the intrinsic value of that stock lies above the current
market price. Similarly, when a stock hits 1 star, we exPEct there is a 75% chance that the intrinsic value of that
stock lies below the current market price.

Morningstar Star Rating for Stocks
Morningstar Equity Research Star Rating Methodology

compare it with the stock ' s current market price on a
daily basis, and the star rating is automatically re-calculated at the market close on every day the market on
which the stock is listed is oPEn. Our analysts keep close

estimates as warranted.
justed return is highly likely over a multiyear time frame.
Scenario analysis develoPEd by our analysts indicates
that the current market price represents an excessively
PEssimistic outlook, limiting downside risk and maximizing upside potential.
QQQQ We believe appreciation beyond a fair risk-adjusted return is likely.
Please note, there is no predefined distribution of stars.
That is, the PErcentage of stocks that earn 5 stars can
fluctuate daily, so the star ratings, in the aggregate, can
serve as a gauge of the bROAder market ' s valuation. When
there are many 5-star stocks, the stock market as a whole
is more undervalued, in our opinion, than when very few
companies garner our highest rating.
We exPEct that if our base-case assumptions are true the
market price will converge on our fair value estimate over
time generally within three years (although it is impossible to predict the exact time frame in which market
prices may adjust).
Our star ratings are guideposts to a bROAd audience and
individuals must consider their own sPEcific investment
goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, time horizon, income
needs, and complete investment portfolio, among other
factors.
The Morningstar Star Ratings for stocks are defined below:
QQQQQ We believe appreciation beyond a fair risk adQQQ Indicates our belief that investors are likely to receive a fair risk-adjusted return (approximately cost of
equity).
QQ We believe investors are likely to receive a less than
fair risk-adjusted return.
Q Indicates a high probability of undesirable risk-adjusted returns from the current market price over a multiyear
time frame, based on our analysis. Scenario analysis by
our analysts indicates that the market is pricing in an excessively optimistic outlook, limiting upside potential and
leaving the investor exposed to Capital loss.

starting at zero (no risk) with lower scores representing
less unmanaged risk and, for 95% of cases, the unmanaged ESG Risk score is below 50.
Based on their quantitative scores, companies are
grouPEd into one of five Risk Categories (negligible, low,
medium, high, severe). These risk categories are ABSolute,
meaning that a ' high risk ' assessment reflects a comparable degree of unmanaged ESG risk across all subindustries covered.
The ESG Risk Rating Assessment is a visual representation of Sustainalytics ESG Risk Categories on a 1 to 5
scale. Companies with Negligible Risk = 5 Globes, Low
Risk = 4, Medium Risk = 3 Globes, High Risk = 2 Globes,
Severe Risk = 1 Globe. For more information, please visit

Ratings should not be used as the sole basis in evaluating
a company or SECurity. Ratings involve unknown risks and
uncertainties which may cause our exPEctations not to
occur or to differ significantly from what was exPEcted
and should not be considered an offer or solicitation to
buy or sell a SECurity.
Risk Warning
Please note that investments in SECurities are subject to
market and other risks and there is no assurance or guarantee that the intended investment objectives will be
achieved. Past PErformance of a SECurity may or may not
be sustained in future and is no indication of future PErformance. A SECurity investment return and an investor ' s
principal value will fluctuate so that, when redeemed, an
investor ' s shares may be worth more or less than their
original cost. A SECurity ' s current investment PErformance
may be lower or higher than the investment PErformance
noted within the report. Morningstar ' s Uncertainty Rating
serves as a useful data point with resPEct to sensitivity
analysis of the assumptions used in our determining a fair
value price.
