an indicator of future actual results. The results reflect performance of a strategy not historically offered to investors and does not represent returns that any investor actually attained. Backtested results are calculated by the retroactive application of a model constructed on the basis of historical data and based on assumptions integral to the model which may or may not be testable and are subject to losses. General assumptions include: XYZ firm would have been able to purchase the securities recommended by the model and the markets were sufficiently liquid to permit all trading. Changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on the backtested returns presented. Certain assumptions have been made for modeling purposes and are unlikely to be realized. No representations and warranties are made as to the reasonableness of the assumptions. This information is provided for illustrative purposes only. Backtested performance is developed with the benefit of hindsight and has inherent limitations. Specifically, backtested results do not reflect actual trading or the effect of material economic and market factors on the decision-making process. Since trades have not actually been executed, results may have under- or over-compensated for the impact, if any, of certain market factors, such as lack of liquidity, and may not reflect the impact that certain economic or market factors may have had on the decision-making process. Further, backtesting allows the security selection methodology to be adjusted until past returns are maximized. Actual performance may differ significantly from backtested performance. Backtested results are adjusted to reflect the reinvestment of dividends and other income and, except where otherwise indicated, are presented gross-of fees and do not include the effect of backtested transaction costs, management fees, performance fees or expenses, if applicable. Please note all regulatory considerations regarding the presentation of fees must be taken into account. No cash balance or cash flow is included in the calculation.

AMAT stock is trading at a sharp P/E discount to peers, indicating potential for closing the valuation gap.

AMAT has de-risked China sales by expecting China revenue to be in the mid-20s, reducing concerns about decreasing foreign equipment spending in China.
AMAT should see revenue growth from TSMC in the second half of FY25, which is expected to support the stock in the near term.

Geopolitical risks, macro weakness, overdependence on AI semis demand, and geopolitical risks due to policy changes on China/Taiwan are the biggest risks to WFE expectations.
Without a growth driver into FY26, there is difficulty in finding material upside for AMAT's stock.
The revenue forecast for leading logic and DRAM is more conservative than street expectations, contributing to a less optimistic outlook.
