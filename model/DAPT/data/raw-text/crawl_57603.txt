The Bottom Line

The price-to-book (P/B) ratio considers how a stock is priced relative to the book value of its assets. If the P/B is under 1.0, then the market is thought to be underpricing the stock since the accounting value of its assets, if sold, would be greater than the market price of the shares. Therefore, value investors typically look for companies that have low price-to-book ratios, among other metrics. A high P/B ratio can also help investors identify and avoid overvalued companies.

Assume that a company has $100 million in assets on the balance sheet, no intangibles, and $75 million in liabilities. Therefore, the book value of that company would be calculated as $25 million ($100 million - $75 million). If there are 10 million shares outstanding, each share would represent $2.50 of book value. Therefore, if the share price is $5, the P/B ratio would be 2.0 (5 / 2.50). This illustrates that the market price is valued at twice its book value, which may or may not indicate overvaluation. This would depend on how P/B ratios compare against other similarly sized companies in the same sector.

Investors find the P/B ratio useful because the book value of equity provides a relatively stable and intuitive metric they can easily compare to the market price. The P/B ratio can also be used for firms with positive book values and negative earnings since negative earnings render price-to-earnings ratios useless. There are fewer companies with negative book values than companies with negative earnings. However, when accounting standards applied by firms vary, P/B ratios may not be comparable, especially for companies from different countries. Additionally, P/B ratios can be less useful for service and information technology companies with little tangible assets on their balance sheets. Finally, the book value can become negative because of a long series of negative earnings, making the P/B ratio useless for relative valuation. Other potential problems in using the P/B ratio stem from the fact that any number of scenarios, such as recent acquisitions, recent write-offs, or share buybacks can distort the book value figure in the equation. When searching for undervalued stocks, investors should consider multiple valuation measures to complement the P/B ratio.

The price-to-book ratio is a commonly used financial ratio. It compares a share's market price to its book value, essentially showing the value given by the market for each dollar of the company’s net worth. High-growth companies often show price-to-book ratios well above 1.0, whereas companies facing financial distress occasionally show ratios below 1.0. Another valuable tool is the price-to-sales ratio, which shows the company’s revenue generated from equity investments.

The price-to-book ratio is important because it can help investors understand whether a company’s market price seems reasonable compared to its balance sheet. For example, if a company shows a high price-to-book ratio, investors might check to see whether that valuation is justified given other measures, such as its historical return on assets or growth in earnings per share (EPS).

What counts as a 'good' price-to-book ratio will depend on the industry in question and the overall state of valuations in the market. An investor assessing the price-to-book ratio of a stock might choose to accept a higher average price-to-book ratio, as compared to an investor looking at the stock of a company in an industry where lower price-to-book ratios are the norm.

The price-to-book (P/B) ratio is a financial metric that compares a company\'s market value to its book value, which is the value of all its assets minus its liabilities, helping investors identify undervalued stocks.

Many investors use the price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio) to compare a firm\'s market capitalization to its book value and locate undervalued companies. This ratio is calculated by dividing the company\'s current stock price per share by its book value per share (BVPS).

* The price-to-book (P/B) ratio measures the market\'s valuation of a company relative to its book value.
* The market value of equity is typically higher than the book value of a company\'s stock.
* The price-to-book ratio is used by value investors to identify potential investments.
* P/B ratios under 1.0 are typically considered solid investments by value investors.
* A good P/B ratio is relative to a business and its industry.

The formula for the price-to-book ratio is: P/BRatio=MarketPriceperShareBookValueperShareP/B ~Ratio = \dfrac{Market~Price~per~Share}{Book~Value~per~Share}P/BRatio=BookValueperShareMarketPriceperShare​ Where:
* Market Price per Share = Current market price of the share
* Book Value per Share = (Total assets - intangible assets - total liabilities) ÷ number of outstanding shares
Market value per share is obtained by looking at the information available on most stock tracking websites. You need to find the company\'s balance sheet to obtain total assets, total liabilities, and outstanding shares. Most investment websites display this financial report under a \"financials\" tab—some show it on a stock\'s summary tab.

The P/B ratio reflects the value that market participants attach to a company\'s equity relative to the book value of its equity. Many investors use the P/B ratio to find undervalued stocks. By purchasing an [undervalued stock](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/040815/what-average-pricetobook-ratio-bank.asp), they hope to be rewarded when the market realizes the stock is undervalued and returns its price to where it should be—according to the investor\'s analysis.
Some investors believe that the P/B ratio is a forward-looking metric that reflects a company\'s future cash flows.

Thus, the ratio isn\'t forward-looking and doesn\'t predict or indicate future cash flows. The P/B ratio also provides a valuable reality check for investors seeking [growth at a reasonable price](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/garp.asp). It is often evaluated with [return on equity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnonequity.asp) (ROE), a reliable growth indicator.
Large discrepancies between the P/B ratio and ROE often raise a red flag for investors.

Overvalued growth stocks frequently show a combination of low ROE and high P/B ratios. Properly valued stocks have ROE and P/B ratios that grow somewhat similarly because stocks that generate higher returns tend to attract investors and increase demand, thus increasing the stock\'s market price.
A high P/B ratio suggests a stock could be overvalued, while a lower P/B ratio could mean the stock is [undervalued](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/undervalued.asp).

As with most ratios, the P/B ratio varies by industry. A company should be compared with similarly structured companies in similar industries; otherwise, the comparison results could be misleading.

It is difficult to pinpoint a specific numeric value of a \"good\" price-to-book (P/B) ratio when determining if a stock is undervalued and therefore, a good investment. It\'s helpful to identify some general parameters or a range for P/B value, then consider various other factors and [valuation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valuation.asp) measures that more accurately interpret the P/B value and forecast a company\'s potential for growth.
The P/B ratio has been favored by [value investors](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valueinvesting.asp) for decades and is widely used by market analysts.
Traditionally, any value under 1.0 is considered desirable for value investors, indicating an undervalued stock may have been identified. However, some value investors may often consider stocks with a less stringent P/B value of less than 3.0 as their benchmark.
