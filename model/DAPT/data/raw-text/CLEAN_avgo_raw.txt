Company Overview
Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) designs, develops, and supplies semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions through two segments: semiconductor solutions and infrastructure software. The semiconductor segment includes IP licensing and data movement solutions for data centers, telecom, enterprise, and embedded applications. It also supplies RF semiconductors, wireless connectivity, and touch controllers for the wireless market. Key markets include broadband, networking, wireless, storage, and industrial. Revenue mix in FY21: 66% Asia Pacific, 22% Americas, 12% Europe.

Investment Overview
Broadcom drives growth through acquisitions and tech differentiation. It leads in semiconductor design for communications and connectivity and operates as an infrastructure software provider. Successful M&A activity has enabled it to expand, including Avago-Broadcom (US$37bn), CA Technologies (US$19bn), and Symantec Enterprise Security (US$11bn). In May 2022, Broadcom announced the US$69bn acquisition of VMware, its largest to date. Broadcom’s strength lies in its high-performance design and market-specific product development, yielding above-industry margins.

Strong demand and lead times reflect a healthy backlog. Technological drivers like 5G, WiFi 7, 6GHz AFC spectrum, and 51.2tbps switches support future growth. Its leadership is evidenced by (i) a multi-year, multibillion-dollar 5G deal with Apple and (ii) projections for AI-related sales to double and contribute 25% of revenue by FY24F. The VMware acquisition supports Broadcom’s infrastructure software leadership as cloud adoption increases.

Improving financials validate the strategic direction. The company has delivered a 10-year CAGR of 28% in revenue and 35% in EBITDA. The shift to software (with more loyal customers) has improved margins—EBITDA margin rose from 31.5% in FY12 to 53.6% in FY21. Consistent free cash flow generation and stable dividends further differentiate Broadcom from peers.

We maintain a BUY rating on AVGO and raise the target price to US$919, based on 16.3x forward P/BV on blended FY23F/24F book value (current: 14.5x). Justification: strong product demand, market leadership, and projected ROE averaging 71.6% in FY23F–25F. The VMware acquisition and future M&A are catalysts for re-rating.

Risks
Future acquisitions may not deliver expected synergies. As one of the most leveraged firms in the sector, Broadcom faces higher financing costs with rising interest rates. Additional risks include antitrust scrutiny on future deals and exposure to US-China tensions—36% of revenue in FY21 came from China, 19% from the US. With net debt to equity of 1.1x, Broadcom carries significant leverage.
