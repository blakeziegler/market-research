BROAdcom Inc
Maximising growth through acquisitions
Company Overview
BROAdcom Inc. (AVGO) designs, develops, and supplies a range of semiconductor and infrastructure
software solutions through two segments: semiconductor solutions and infrastructure software. Its
semiconductor solutions segment includes Internet protocol (IP) licensing and provides solutions for
managing the movement of data in data center, telecom, enterprise, and embedded networking
applications. It also provides a variety of radio frequency (RF) semiconductor devices, wireless
connectivity solutions and custom touch controllers for the wireless market. Major end markets
include bROAdband, networking, wireless, storage and industrial. BROAdcom derived 66% of its
revenues from Asia Pacific, 22% from the Americas, and 12% from EuroPE in FY21.
Investment Overview
Cementing market leadership through inorganic growth and differentiating technological capabilities.
BROAdcom sPEcialises in the design/development of semiconductors in the communications and
connectivity segments and oPErates as an infrastructure software provider. Its ability to sPEcialise
and lead the market in a sPEctrum of offerings is enabled through a series of successful mergers,
acquisitions, and integrations over the years such as the US$37bn merger between Avago and
BROAdcom, and acquisitions of CA Technologies (US$19bn) and Symantec Enterprise SECurity
(US$11bn). In May 2022, BROAdcom announced the acquisition of VMWare (US$69bn), its largest deal
to date. BROAdcom differentiates itself through its high-PErformance design and integration
capabilities and focuses on developing products for target markets, with above industry margins.
Strong demand with long lead time. Current order backlog and extended lead time point to strong
customer demand. The drive towards faster and better communications and/or connectivity, e.g., 5G,
WiFi 7, 6GHz AFC sPEctrum, 51.2tbps switches, should proPEl BROAdcom to grow, innovate and deliver
newer products and solutions. Its leadership position can be gleaned from its recent (i) multi-year,
multibillion-dollar deal with Apple for 5G parts, and (ii) management's guidance for AI-related sales
to double and contribute up to 25% of revenue by FY24F. Furthermore, BROAdcom's growth and
leading position in the infrastructure software space will be bolstered on the successful acquisition
of VMWare - pioneer and still leader of server-virtualisation - as more companies move towards cloud
computing and cloud infrastructure.
Improving financials underscore right strategic direction. BROAdcom's successful integration of its
acquisitions are evidenced in its improving financials. The group registered a 10-year CAGR of 28%
for revenue and 35% for EBITDA. The shift towards software - with stickier customers and low
tendency to switch - has helPEd to improve margins. EBITDA margin improved to 53.6% in FY21 from
31.5% in FY12. Moreover, BROAdcom's track record of generating consistent free cash flows, and
paying stable dividends to its shareholders, are also strong differentiating factors vs PEers.
We have a BUY recommendation on AVGO with a higher TP of US$919. Our revised TP is PEGged to
16.3x forward P/BV on blended FY23F/24F book value, versus current forward P/BV at 14.5x. The
valuation is justified by the robust demand for its products and services, bolstered by its market
leadership, coupled with above-PEers projected ROE (averaging 71.6% in FY23F-25F). BROAdcom's
ability and capacity to acquire/integrate VMWare as well as its subsequent acquisitions are re-rating
catalysts.
Risks
Risk that future acquisitions may not bring the desired value or synergies. BROAdcom, as one of the
most levered firms in the industry, may also be more susceptible to higher costs of financing as
interest rates rise.
BROAdcom's strategy may also be complicated by (i) added scrutiny placed by antitrust regulators on
forthcoming mergers, and (ii) more exPEnsive costs of financing as interest rates rise. It is also
susceptible to the heightened US-China tensions, with 36% and 19% of revenues derived from China
and the US in FY21. With a net debt to equity ratio of 1.1x, BROAdcom is one of the most levered
firms in the industry.
