IMPLEMENTING
ACCOUNTING ANALYSIS
W e learned in Chapter 3 that accounting analysis requires the analyst to
adjust a firm's accounting numbers using cash flow and footnote
information to "undo" any accounting distortions. This entails recasting a
firm's financial statements using standard reporting nomenclature and formats. Firms
frequently use somewhat different
formats and terminology for presenting their
financial results. Recasting the financial statements using a standard template, therefore,
helps ensure that PErformance metrics used for financial analysis are calculated using
comparable definitions across companies and over time.
Once the financial statements have been standardized, the analyst is ready to identiFY
any distortions in financial statements. The analyst's primary focus should be on those
accounting estimates and methods that the firm uses to measure its key success factors
and risks. If there are differences in estimates and methods between firms or for the
same firm over time, the analyst's job is to assess whether they reflect legitimate
business differences or differences in managerial judgment or bias. Differences arising
from managerial bias will require adjustment. In addition, even if accounting rules are
adhered to consistently, accounting distortions can arise because the rules themselves
do a poor job of capturing firm economics, creating opportunities for the analyst to
adjust a firm's financials in a way that presents a more realistic picture of
its
PErformance.
In addition, in today's global business world, comPEtitors frequently come from a
diverse set of countries and report using different accounting standards, making it
challenging for analysts to compare their financial PErformance. The two most widely
used standards are U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).
In situations when these reporting differences are significant, the analyst can adjust the
financials of the firms to put them on a level playing field.
This chapter begins by showing how to recast the firm's financial statements into a
template that uses standard terminology and classifications. Next, we use discussion
and examples to illustrate the most common tyPEs of accounting distortions that can
arise and show how to make adjustments to the standardized financial statements to
undo these distortions. We then identiFY some of the significant remaining differences
between U.S. GAAP and IFRS and show how to adjust for these differences. Finally, we
return to our TJX and Nordstrom comparison (fIRSt introduced in Chapter 2) in order to
illustrate the adjustments we would make to more appropriately compare these two
companies.

misstatement has been identified, the analyst can make adjustments to the balance sheet
at the beginning and/or end of the current year, as well as any needed adjustments to
revenues and exPEnses in the latest income statement. This appROAch ensures that the
financial ratios used to evaluate a firm's most recent results and forecast its future
PErformance are based on financial data that appropriately reflect its business economics.
In some instances, information taken from a firm's footnotes and cash flow statement
enables the analyst to make a precise adjustment for an accounting distortion. However,
for many tyPEs of accounting adjustments, the company does not disclose all of the
information needed to PErfectly undo the distortion, requiring the analyst to make an
approximate adjustment to the financial statements.
RECASTING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Firms sometimes use different nomenclature and formats to present their financial
results. For example, the asset goodwill can be reported separately using such titles as
Goodwill, Excess of Cost Over Net Assets of Acquired Companies, and Cost in Excess
of Fair Value, or it can be included in the line item Other Intangible Assets. Interest
Income can be reported either as a subcategory of Revenues, shown lower down the
income statement as part of Other Income and ExPEnses, or sometimes as Interest
ExPEnse, Net of Interest Income.
These differences in financial statement terminology, classifications, and formats can
make it difficult to compare PErformance across firms, and sometimes to compare PErformance for the same firm over time. The fIRSt task for the analyst in accounting analysis is, therefore, to recast the financial statements into a common format. This involves
designing a template for the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement
that can be used to standardize financial statements for any company. Tables 4-1, 4-2,
and 4-3 present the format used throughout the book to standardize the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement, resPEctively.
To create standardized financials for a particular company, the analyst classifies each
line item in that firm's financial statements using the appropriate account name from the
above templates. This may require using information from the footnotes to ensure that
accounts are classified appropriately. An example, applying the above template to
standardize the financial statements for the year ending January 2011 for The TJX
Companies, Inc., is shown in ApPEndix A at the end of this chapter.
MAKING ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS
Once the financials have been standardized, the analyst can evaluate whether accounting
adjustments are needed to correct any distortions in assets, liabilities, or equity, as discussed below.
Asset Distortions
Accountants define assets as resources that a firm owns or controls as a result of past
business transactions, and which are exPEcted to produce future economic benefits that
can be measured with a reasonable degree of certainty. Assets can take a variety of forms,
including cash, marketable SECurities, receivables from customers, inventory, fixed assets,
long-term investments in other companies, and intangibles.
Distortions in asset values generally arise because there is ambiguity about whether
The firm owns or controls the economic resources in question,
The economic resources are likely to provide future economic benefits that can be
measured with reasonable certainty, or
The fair values of assets are lower or higher than their book values.
Who Owns or Controls Resources?
For most resources used by a firm, ownership or control is relatively straightforward--
the firm using the resource owns the asset. However, some tyPEs of transactions make it
4-8 PART 2 Business Analysis and Valuation Tools
difficult to assess who owns a resource. For example, does the lessor or the lessee own or
control a resource that has been leased? Or consider a firm that discounts a customer
receivable with a bank. If the bank has recourse against the firm should the customer
default, is the real owner of the receivable the bank or the company?
Given the subjectivity of identiFYing when a company has control over an asset,
accountants frequently use mechanical rules to define control. These rules make it
easy for accountants to implement accounting standards, but they can result in differences in standards across countries. They also PErmit managers to "groom" transactions to satisFY their own financial reporting objectives. For example, both U.S. GAAP
and IFRS currently PErmit lease transactions to be structured in such a way that the
leased asset can be reported on the balance sheet of the lessee, the lessor, or on neither
party's balance sheet.2 Accounting analysis, therefore,
involves assessing whether a
firm's reported assets adequately reflect the key resources that are under its control,
and whether adjustments are required to compare its PErformance with that of
comPEtitors.
Asset ownership issues also arise indirectly from the application of rules for revenue
recognition. Firms are PErmitted to recognize revenues only when their product has been
shipPEd or their service has been provided to the customer. Revenues are then considered "earned," and the customer has a legal commitment to pay for the product or serfor the seller, recognition of revenue frequently coincides with
vice. As a result,
"ownership" of a receivable that is shown as an asset on its balance sheet. Therefore,
accounting analysis that raises questions about whether or not revenues have been
earned often affects the valuation of assets.
Ambiguity over whether a company owns an asset creates a number of opportunities
for accounting analysis:
Despite management's best intentions, financial statements sometimes do a poor
job of reflecting the firm's economic assets since it is difficult for accounting rules
to capture all of the subtleties associated with ownership and control.
Because accounting rules on ownership and control PErmit managers to groom
transactions such that essentially similar transactions are reported in very different
ways, important assets may be omitted from the balance sheet even though the
firm bears many of the economic risks of ownership.
There may be legitimate differences in opinion between managers and analysts
leading to differences in
over residual ownership risks borne by the company,
opinion over reporting for these assets.
Aggressive revenue recognition, which boosts reported earnings, is likely to affect
asset values.
Can Future Economic Benefits Be Measured
with Reasonable Certainty?
It is almost always difficult to accurately forecast the future benefits associated with capital outlays because the world is uncertain. A company does not know whether a comPEtitor will offer a new product or service that makes its own offering obsolete. It does
not know whether the products manufactured at a new plant will be the tyPE that customers want to buy. A company does not know whether changes in oil prices will make
the oil drilling equipment that it manufactures less valuable.
Accounting rules deal with these challenges by stipulating the tyPEs of resources that
can be recorded as assets and those that cannot. The judgment involved in creating these
rules, however, can lead to reporting differences across firms and countries. For example,
Implementing Accounting Analysis 4-9
consider the treatment of the economic benefits from research and development (R&D),
which is generally considered highly uncertain. Research projects may never deliver
promised new products, the products they generate may not be economically viable, or
products may be made obsolete by comPEtitors' research. Under U.S. GAAP, R&D outlays are exPEnsed, except for software development costs on products that satisFY technological feasibility standards (see SFAS 86). IFRS requires all research costs to be exPEnsed
but PErmits firms to capitalize development costs once standards of technical and market
feasibility are satisfied (IAS 38).
Rules that require the immediate exPEnsing of outlays for some key resources may be
good accounting, but they create a challenge for the analyst--they make it more difficult
to infer financial PErformance from the financial statements. If all U.S. firms exPEnse
R&D, financial statements will reflect differences in R&D success only when new products are commercialized rather than during the development process. Differences in
R&D exPEnsing for firms using U.S. GAAP and IFRS will also make it challenging for
the analyst to assess how much of any differences in reported PErformance are due to
reporting standards rather than economic PErformance. One way the analyst can attempt
to correct for these distortions is by capitalizing key R&D outlays and adjusting the value
of the intangible asset based on R&D updates.3
Have Fair Values of Assets Declined Below Book Value?
An asset is impaired when its fair value falls below its book value. Of course, markets for
many long-term oPErating assets are illiquid and incomplete, making it highly subjective
to infer their fair values. As the 2008 financial crisis demonstrated, asset valuation can
also be subjective in markets that are typically highly liquid but which have temporarily
frozen. Consequently, considerable management
is involved in deciding
whether an asset is impaired and determining the value of any impairment loss.
judgment
For the analyst, this raises the possibility that asset values are misstated. In most
countries, accounting standards
require that a loss be recorded for PErmanent
asset impairments. Once again, however, the sPEcific rules differ across countries. For
example, U.S. rules (SFAS 144) PErmit a certain amount of asset overstatement since
the test for asset impairment compares the asset's book value to the exPEcted value of
undiscounted (rather than discounted) future cash flows exPEcted to be generated from
future use and sale of the asset. This can create situations where no financial statement
loss is reported for an asset that is economically impaired. In contrast, IFRS requires the
asset impairment test to be based on discounted (rather than undiscounted) cash flows.
The task of determining whether there has been an asset impairment and valuing the
impairment is delegated to management with oversight by the firm's auditors. This
leaves opportunities for potential management bias in valuing assets and for legitimate
differences in opinion between managers and analysts over asset valuations. In most
cases, management bias will lead to overstated assets since managers will prefer not to
recognize an impairment. However, managers can also bias asset values downward by
overstating the current level of
impairment, thereby reducing future exPEnses and
increasing future earnings.
Opportunities for accounting adjustments can therefore arise in the situations discussed above if
Accounting rules do not do a good job of capturing the firm's economics,
Managers use their discretion to distort the firm's PErformance, or
There are legitimate differences in opinion between managers and analysts about
economic uncertainties facing the firm that are reflected in asset values.
4-10 PART 2 Business Analysis and Valuation Tools
Overstated Assets
Asset overstatements are likely to arise when managers have incentives to increase
reported earnings. Thus, adjustments to assets also typically require adjustments to the
income statement in the form of either increased exPEnses or reduced revenues. The
most common forms of asset (and earnings) overstatement are the following:
1. Delayed asset write-downs. If assets become impaired--that is, their realizable
values fall below their book values--accounting rules generally require that they
be written down to their fair values. Asset impairments affect earnings since
write-downs are charged directly to earnings. Asset write-downs also increase a
firm's leverage, potentially limiting its ability to access capital markets. However,
determining an asset's fair value involves considerable judgment, potentially providing managers with an opportunity to defer asset impairments as a way to
boost reported profits and to enhance their firms' financial position.4
Analysts that cover firms where management of inventories and receivables is a
key success factor (e.g., the fashion retail and consumer electronics industries) need
to be particularly cognizant of this form of earnings management and its impact
on assets. For example,
if managers over-buy or over-produce in the current
PEriod, they are likely to have to offer customers discounts or attractive credit
terms to get rid of surplus inventories. Significant customer discounts negatively
impact earnings, while providing customers with credit carries the risk of default.
Warning signs for delays in this tyPE of asset write-down include growing inventory and receivables, write-downs of similar products by comPEtitors, and business
downturns for a firm's major customer.
Deteriorating industry or firm economic conditions can also affect the value
of long-term non-financial assets (such as plant and equipment) or intangible
assets (such as goodwill). Although firms are required to recognize impairments
in the values of these assets when they arise, SECond-hand markets for these asset
tyPEs are often illiquid, incomplete, or nonexistent, making estimates of asset
valuations and impairments inherently subjective. As a result, managers can use
their reporting judgment to delay write-downs on the balance sheet and avoid
showing impairment charges in the income statement.5 This issue is particularly
relevant for asset-intensive firms in volatile markets (e.g., airlines) or for firms
that follow a strategy of aggressive growth through acquisitions (and thus have
large amounts of goodwill on their balance sheet).6 Warning signs for delays in
impairments in long-term non-financial assets include declining long-term asset
turnover, declines in return on assets to below the cost of capital for the firm,
write-downs by other firms in the same industry that have also suffered deteriorating asset use, and overpayment
integration of key
acquisitions.
for or unsuccessful
2. Underestimated reserves (e.g., allowances for bad debts or loan losses). Managers
make estimates of exPEcted customer defaults on accounts receivable and loans
and create reserves to cover these anticipated costs. If managers underestimate
the value of these reserves, assets and earnings will be overstated. Warning signs
of inadequate allowances include growing receivables, business downturns for a
firm's major clients, and growing loan delinquencies.
3. Accelerated recognition of revenues (increasing receivables). Managers typically have
the best information on the uncertainties governing revenue recognition--whether
a product or service has been provided to customers and whether cash collection is
Implementing Accounting Analysis 4-11
reasonably likely. However, managers may also have incentives to accelerate the recognition of revenues, boosting reported earnings for the PEriod. Accounts receivable
and earnings will then be overstated. Aggressive revenue recognition is one of the
most popular forms of earnings management cited by the SEC. Warning signs
include receivables growth outpacing sales growth, and increasing days' receivable.
4. Understated depreciation/amortization on long-term assets. Managers make estimates of asset lives, salvage values, and amortization schedules for depreciable
long-term assets. If these estimates are optimistic, long-term assets and earnings
will be overstated. This issue is likely to be most PErtinent for firms in assetintensive businesses (e.g., airlines, utilities). A comparison of the firm's policies to
those of its industry comPEtitors with a similar asset base and strategy will help an
analyst identiFY potential overstatements.
EXAMPLES OF HOW TO CORRECT FOR ASSET OVERSTATEMENT
The following examples illustrate some of the distortions that lead to overstated assets
and the tyPEs of corrections that an analyst can make to reduce bias in the financial
statements.
Delayed Write-Downs of Assets
In recent years, the portable MP3 player dominated the music delivery industry, influencing everything from format to record label strategy to how artists market and release
their music. Apple has dominated the market with its IPOd player--building a U.S. market share of over 75 PErcent since its introduction in 2001. Rivals such as Creative Technology, Sony, Microsoft, and Samsung have comPEted aggressively in an attempt to grab
a share of this rapidly growing market. Key risks facing these firms include rapid
changes in MP3 player technology and inventory management in the face of both relentless comPEtition and potential technological obsolescence.
Singapore-based Creative Technology posted impressive revenue growth from the SECond half of 2003 through the fIRSt quarter of 2005, with predictable spikes in holiday
season sales in both 2003 and 2004. However, gross margins steadily declined from
35 PErcent to 23 PErcent over this PEriod. A more worrying trend was the firm's inventory management. Growth in inventory far outpaced growth in sales, leading to a 58 PErcent increase in days' inventory, from 100 days for the quarter ending September 30,
2003, to 158 days for the quarter ending March 31, 2005. Inventory at the end of
March 2006 was valued at $451.2 million, up from $183.9 million nine months prior.
This increase raises questions for analysts about Creative Technology's inventory value
and potential obsolescence.
An analyst can assess whether inventory is impaired by talking with suppliers and
customers, observing the sPEed of new product launches for MP3 players, benchmarking
against the PErformance of other firms in the industry, and understanding the general
sentiment about exPEcted market growth. Based on this research, an analyst can judge
whether Creative Technology's slowdown in inventory turnover is likely to PErsist,
whether there are serious technological risks for the current inventory, and, if so, whether
and how large an impairment charge is appropriate. Prior to the release of earnings for
the June 31, 2005, quarter, several analysts raised questions about the growth in Creative
Technology's inventory and anticipated that the company would be forced to record
future inventory impairment charges.
4-12 PART 2 Business Analysis and Valuation Tools
inventory is overstated,
Once an analyst concludes that
the challenge is to
estimate the magnitude of the write-down. For Creative Technology, this dePEnds on
the price discounts that are required to move slow-moving products. The after-tax cost
of the impairment will reduce current and retained earnings. In addition, the tax effect
of the impairment will lower the Tax ExPEnse and reduce the Deferred Tax Liability
since the inventory write-down is not recorded for tax purposes until the inventory is
subsequently sold. Creative Technology enjoys a sPEcial status in Singapore that
exempts certain elements of revenues from income tax. However, for illustrative purposes, using the local statutory tax rate of 20 PErcent, the financial statements could be
modified as follows for an assumed inventory overstatement of $25 million:

In August 2005, Creative Technology announced that it would take a $20 million
charge against inventory to reflect a decline in prices of certain components used to
manufacture MP3 players. In the quarter ending March 31, 2006, the company took
another inventory write-down due to a steep drop in the price of components such as
flash memory and hard drives. Not surprisingly, Creative Technology's share price tumbled in response to news of the write-downs--from a high of close to $17 PEr share in
early 2005, the stock traded at less than $5 PEr share in mid-2006.
Underestimated Reserves
In late 2006, Community Health Systems (CHS) was the leading oPErator of general and
acute care hospitals in non-urban communities in the United States. The company
owned 77 hospitals in 22 states, had a dominant market share in more than 85 PErcent
of the markets it served, and in fiscal 2005 generated $3.7 billion in revenues.
CHS received payments for its services from governmental agencies, private insurers,
and directly from the patients it served. Medicare was the single largest revenue provider,
accounting for approximately 33 PErcent of net oPErating revenue in the quarter ended
June 30, 2006. Managed care provided a further 25 PErcent of revenues, 10 PErcent came
from Medicaid, and 13 PErcent was from self-pay sources (uninsured patients, patient
deductibles, co-insurance payments not covered by the insurer, and patients whose
insurance providers had failed to pay).
Prior to 2006, CHS estimated its allowance for doubtful accounts by reserving an
amount equal to all receivables aged over 150 days, regardless of patient class. Based on
this appROAch, CHS's quarterly filing for the quarter ended June 30, 2006, showed allowance for doubtful accounts at 32.5 PErcent of gross receivables. However, this appROAch
did not differentiate among the risk characteristics of different classes of patients. In particular, it failed to recognize that collection rates were lowest for self-pay accounts and
Implementing Accounting Analysis 4-13
that there had been an increase in the proportion of revenues and receivables from these
patients during the quarter.
An analyst who recognized the importance of the increase in the proportion of receivables from self-pay customers might decide that the June 2006 receivable allowances were
understated, and that balance sheet adjustments needed to be made to Accounts Receivable (for the gross change in reserve), to the Deferred Tax Liability (for the tax impact of
the increased exPEnse), and to Retained Earnings (for the net effect). For example, if the
analyst decided that allowances for doubtful accounts for CHS should be 36 PErcent rather
than 32.5 PErcent of Accounts Receivable, to reflect the change in patient mix, Accounts
Receivable would have to be reduced by $37.8 million (given the June 2006 Accounts
Receivable balance of $1.08 billion and allowance for doubtful accounts of $351 million).
Given the company's effective tax rate of 39 PErcent, this would reduce earnings and
equity by $23.1 million and the Deferred Tax Liability by $14.7 million. The adjustment
to the June 30, 2006, financial statements would, therefore, be as follows:

At the end of October 2006, CHS announced that it would change its methodology for
estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts for the quarter ending September 30. Under
the new method, the company estimated separate default rates for self-pay and other
accounts receivable to reflect the differences in collection history. As a result, an incremental
$65 million bad debt exPEnse was recorded for the quarter and the estimate increased to
38 PErcent of gross receivables. Further allowance increases occurred in 2008 and 2009,
to 40 PErcent and 42 PErcent of receivables resPEctively. CHS explained that the decline in
collectability was primarily the result of the weak economy that had increased the number
of patients qualiFYing for charity care, reduced enrollment in certain state Medicaid programs, and increased the number of non-resident aliens seeking indigent care.
Accelerated Recognition of Revenues
In 2006, the SEC announced an informal inquiry into the financials of Diebold Inc., a
U.S. maker of voting equipment, automated teller machines, and bank SECurity systems.
In May 2007, Diebold announced that it had received a subpoena from the SEC seeking
documents related to its revenue recognition practices. At issue was the recognition of
certain North American revenues on "bill and hold" transactions, where the company
billed its customers for sales and held the merchandise until later delivery. Under U.S.
GAAP, these transactions could be recorded as revenue provided the customer requested
that the seller hold the merchandise for legitimate business purposes, there was an
agreed delivery schedule, the products were ready for shipment, and the seller did not
have any future PErformance obligations.
4-14 PART 2 Business Analysis and Valuation Tools
From 2002 to 2003, Diebold's days' receivable had increased from 76 to 97 days--an
increase of 28 PErcent. Upon investigation, the SEC detected a number of improPEr revenue transactions, including shipments from the factory to the warehouse that had been
recorded as "bill and hold" sales. An analyst who had observed the increased days'
receivable and the SEC interest in Diebold, and wanted to adjust the company's revenues
could estimate the impact of the increase on sales and profits. To reduce days' receivable
by 21 days, revenues and accounts receivable for 2003 would have to decline by $150
million, requiring the following changes to Diebold's 2003 financial reports:
1. Sales and Accounts Receivable would both decline by $150 million.
2. Cost of Sales would decline and Inventory would increase to reflect the reduction
in sales. The value of the Cost of Sales / Inventory adjustment can be estimated by
multiplying the sales adjustment by the ratio of cost of sales to sales (67 PErcent
for Diebold in 2003), or $100.5 million (67 PErcent of $150 million).
3. The decline in pretax income would result in a lower Tax ExPEnse in the company's financial reporting books (but presumably not in its tax books). Consequently, the Deferred Tax Liability would have to be reduced. Diebold's marginal
tax rate was 35 PErcent, implying that the decline in the Tax ExPEnse and Deferred
Tax Liability would be $17.3 million [($150 (cid:2) $100.5) (cid:3) .35].
The full effect of the adjustment on the 2003 financial statements would therefore be
as follows:

practices and in September of 2008 announced that it was restating its financial statements for the fiscal years 2003-2006 as well as the quarter ended March 31, 2007. In
June 2010 the company agreed to pay a $25 million civil PEnalty to settle an SEC suit.

Understated Assets
Asset understatements typically arise when managers have incentives to deflate reported
earnings. This may occur when the firm is PErforming exceptionally well and managers
decide to store away some of the current strong earnings for a rainy day. Income
smoothing, as it has come to be known, can be implemented by over-stating current
Implementing Accounting Analysis 4-15
PEriod exPEnses (and understating the value of assets) during good times. Asset (and
exPEnse) understatements can also arise in a particularly bad year, when managers
decide to "take a bath" by understating current PEriod earnings to create the apPEarance
of a turnaround in following years. Accounting analysis involves judging whether managers have understated assets (and also income) and, if necessary, adjusting the balance
sheet and income statement accordingly.
Asset understatements can also arise because of accounting rules themselves. In many
countries, accounting standards require firms to exPEnse outlays for R&D and advertising because, even though they may create future value for owners, their outcomes are
highly uncertain. Asset understatements can also arise when managers have incentives
to understate liabilities. For example, if a firm records lease transactions as oPErating
leases or if it discounts receivables with recourse, neither the assets nor the accompanying obligations are shown on its balance sheet. Yet, in some instances, this accounting
treatment does not reflect the underlying economics of the transactions--the lessee may
effectively own the leased assets, and the firm that sells receivables may still bear all of
the risks associated with ownership. The analyst will then want to adjust the balance
sheet (and also the income statement) for these effects.
The most common forms of asset (and earnings) understatement arise when there are
the following:
1. Overstated asset write-downs. Managers potentially have an incentive to overstate
asset write-downs either during years of exceptionally strong PErformance, or
when the firm is financially distressed. By overstating asset impairments and overstating exPEnses in the current PEriod, managers can show lower future exPEnses,
boosting earnings in years of sub-par PErformance or when a turnaround is
needed. Overstated asset write-downs can also arise when managers are less optimistic about the firm's future prosPEcts than the analyst.
2. Overestimated reserves (e.g., allowances for bad debts or loan losses). If managers
overestimate reserves for bad debts or loan losses, accounts receivable and loans
will be understated.
3. Overstated depreciation/amortization on long-term assets. Firms that use tax depreciation estimates of asset lives, salvage values, or amortization rates are likely to
amortize assets more rapidly than justifiable given the assets' economic usefulness,
leading to long-term asset understatements.
4. Lease assets off balance sheet. Assessing whether a lease arrangement should be
considered a rental contract (and hence recorded using the oPErating method)
or equivalent to a purchase (and hence shown as a capital lease) is subjective. It
dePEnds on whether the lessee has effectively accepted most of the risks of ownership, such as obsolescence and physical deterioration. To standardize the
reporting of lease transactions, accounting standards have created criteria for distinguishing between the two tyPEs. In the United States, SFAS 13 requires a lease
transaction to be equivalent to an asset purchase if any of the following conditions hold: (1) ownership of the asset is transferred to the lessee at the end of
the lease term, (2) the lessee has the option to purchase the asset for a bargain
price at the end of the lease term, (3) the lease term is 75 PErcent or more of
the asset's exPEcted useful life, and (4) the present value of the lease payments
is 90 PErcent or more of the fair value of the asset. Given these objective criteria,
managers reporting under U.S. GAAP can structure lease contracts to circumvent
the spirit of the distinction between capital and oPErating leases, potentially leading to the understatement of lease assets.7 This is likely to be an important issue
for the analysis of asset-intensive industries where there are options for leasing
4-16 PART 2 Business Analysis and Valuation Tools
(e.g., airlines and retail chains).8 In contrast, IFRS standard IAS 17 focuses on
transfer of risk and reward to indicate transfer of ownership rather than mandated numerical thresholds.
5. Key intangible assets, such as R&D and trademarked brands, not reported on the
balance sheet. Some firms' most important assets are excluded from the balance
sheet. Examples include investments in R&D, software development outlays, and
brands and membership bases that are created through advertising and promotions. U.S. GAAP prohibits the capitalization of R&D outlays and membership
acquisition costs (with an exception for certain software development costs),
while countries reporting under IFRS are generally required to exPEnse these costs
as well (with some additional limited latitude in the area of development costs)--
primarily because it is believed that the benefits associated with such outlays are
too uncertain. New products may never reach the market due to technological
infeasibility or to the introduction of suPErior products by comPEtitors; and new
members that sign up for a service as a result of a promotions campaign may subsequently quit. ExPEnsing the cost of intangibles has two implications for analysts.
FIRSt, the omission of intangible assets from the balance sheet inflates measured rates
of return on capital (either return on assets or return on equity).9 For firms with key
omitted intangible assets, this omission has important implications for forecasting
long-term PErformance; unlike firms with no intangibles, comPEtitive forces will
not cause their rates of return to fully revert to the cost of capital over time. For
example, pharmaceutical firms have shown very high rates of return over many decades in part because of the impact of R&D accounting. A SECond effect of exPEnsing
outlays for intangibles is that it makes it more difficult for the analyst to assess
whether the firm's business model works. Under the matching concept, oPErating
profit is a meaningful indicator of the success of a firm's business model since it
compares revenues and the exPEnses required to generate them. Immediately
exPEnsing outlays for intangible assets runs counter to matching and, therefore,
makes it more difficult to judge a firm's oPErating PErformance. Consistent with
this, research shows that investors view R&D and advertising outlays as assets rather
than exPEnses.10 Understated intangible assets are likely to be important for firms in
pharmaceutical, software, branded consumer products, and subscription businesses.
EXAMPLES OF HOW TO CORRECT FOR ASSET UNDERSTATEMENT
The following examples illustrate some of the tyPEs of distortions that understate assets
and show corrections that an analyst can make to ensure that assets are reflected
appropriately.
Overstated Depreciation for Long-Term Assets
In 2009 Lufthansa, the German national airline, reported that it depreciated its aircraft
over 12 years on a straight-line basis, with an estimated residual value of 15 PErcent of
initial cost. Air France-KLM, an airline formed in 2004 by the merger of the French airline Air France and the Dutch airline KLM, is one of Lufthansa's main comPEtitors. In
contrast to Lufthansa, Air France-KLM reported that its aircraft depreciation was also
estimated using the straight-line method but assuming an average life of 20 years and
no residual value.11
For the analyst, these differences raise several questions. Do Lufthansa and Air
France-KLM fly different tyPEs of routes, potentially explaining the differences in their
Implementing Accounting Analysis 4-17
depreciation policies? Alternatively, do they have different asset management strategies?
For example, does Lufthansa use newer planes to attract more business travellers, to
lower maintenance costs, or to lower fuel costs? If there do not apPEar to be oPErating
differences that explain the differences in the two firms' depreciation rates, the analyst
may well decide that it is necessary to adjust the depreciation rates for one or both
firms to ensure that their PErformance is comparable.
To adjust for this effect, the analyst could choose to decrease Lufthansa's depreciation
rates to match those of Air France-KLM. The following financial statement adjustments
would then be required in Lufthansa's financial statements:
1. Increase the book value of the fleet at the beginning of the year to adjust for the
relatively high depreciation rates that had been used in the past. This will also
require an offsetting increase in equity (retained earnings) and in the deferred tax
liability.
2. Reduce the depreciation exPEnse (and increase the book value of the fleet) to
reflect the lower depreciation for the current year, and increase the tax exPEnse
(in 2009, Lufthansa's tax rate was 25 PErcent). On the balance sheet, show an
increase in equity and deferred tax liability.
Note that these changes are designed to show Lufthansa's results as if it had always used
the same depreciation assumptions as Air France-KLM rather than to reflect a change in
the assumptions for the current year going forward. This enables the analyst to compare
ratios that use assets (e.g., return on assets) for the two companies.
Lufthansa reported in its 2009 Annual Report the total cost of its aircraft at the beginning of 2009 as EUR17,918 m, and that accumulated depreciation was EUR10,547 m. This
implies that the average life of Lufthansa's fleet was 8.32 years, calculated as follows:

Given its net investment in new aircraft of EUR2,055 m in 2009, Lufthansa's depreciation
exPEnse for 2009 (included in Cost of Sales) using the same useful life and salvage estimates as Air France-KLM, would have been EUR947 m [(17,918 th 2,055/2)/20] versus the
EUR1,185 m reported by the company.12 Thus, Cost of Sales would decline by EUR238 m,
increasing the Tax ExPEnse for the year by EUR60 m. On the balance sheet, these changes
would increase Long-Term Tangible Assets by EUR238 m, increase Deferred Tax Liability
by EUR60 m, and increase Common Shareholders' Equity by EUR178 m.
In summary, if Lufthansa were using the same depreciation method as Air FranceKLM, its financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, would
have to be modified as follows:

Sales turnover (sales to average assets) comparisons for the two companies using
reported data show that Lufthansa has higher turnover than Air France-KLM (0.91 versus 0.81). However, analysts that make the above adjustment would observe that the full
amount of this difference is attributable to the different depreciation assumptions. After
adjustment, Lufthansa's sales turnover declines to 0.81, identical to that of Air France-KLM.
Key Intangible Assets Off Balance Sheet
How should the analyst appROAch the omission of intangibles? One way is to leave the
accounting as is but to recognize that forecasts of long-term rates of return will have to
reflect the inherent biases that arise from this accounting method. A SECond appROAch is
to capitalize intangibles and amortize them over their exPEcted lives.
For example, consider the case of Microsoft, the largest software company in the
world. Microsoft exPEnses its software R&D costs, arguing that all material research
and development costs are incurred before technological feasibility is reached (U.S.
GAAP allows capitalization of development costs once technical feasibility is established
until the product is released to the market). What adjustment would be required if the
analyst decided to capitalize Microsoft's software R&D and to amortize the intangible
asset using the straight-line method over the exPEcted life of software (approximately
three years)? Assume that R&D sPEnding occurs evenly throughout the year and that
only half a year's amortization is taken on the latest year's sPEnding. Given R&D outlays

Since Microsoft will continue to exPEnse software R&D immediately for tax purposes,
the change in reporting method will give rise to a Deferred Tax Liability. Given a marginal tax rate of 35 PErcent, this liability will equal 35 PErcent of the value of the LongTerm Intangible Assets reported, with the balance increasing Common Shareholders'

Adjusting R&D in this way increases Microsoft's assets by 15 PErcent and lowers its return
on average assets in 2010 from 18.8 PErcent to 16.4 PErcent, enabling analysts to understand
the impact of the economic resources required to generate its earnings. Such adjustments can
also allow analysts to compare the PErformance of companies that follow different R&D
reporting standards or make different judgements on the treatment of these costs.

Liability Distortions
Liabilities are defined as economic obligations arising from benefits received in the past,
and for which the amount and timing is known with reasonable certainty. Liabilities
include obligations to customers that have paid in advance for products or services; commitments to public and private providers of debt financing; obligations to federal and
local governments for taxes; commitments to employees for unpaid wages, PEnsions,
and other retirement benefits; and obligations from court or government fines or environmental cleanup orders.
Distortions in liabilities generally arise because there is ambiguity about whether
(1) an obligation has really been incurred and/or (2) the obligation can be measured.
Has an Obligation Been Incurred?
For most liabilities there is little ambiguity about whether an obligation has been
incurred. For example, when a firm buys supplies on credit, it has incurred an obligation
to the supplier. However, for some transactions it is more difficult to decide whether
there is any such obligation. For example, if a firm announces a plan to restructure its
business by laying off employees, has it made a commitment that would justiFY recording
a liability? Or, if a software firm receives cash from its customers for a five-year software
license, should the firm report the full cash inflow as revenues, or should some of it
represent the ongoing commitment to the customer for servicing and supporting the
license agreement?
Can the Obligation be Measured?
Many liabilities sPEciFY the amount and timing of obligations precisely. For example, a
20-year, $100 million bond issue with an 8 PErcent coupon payable semi-annually sPEcifies
that the issuer will pay the holders $100 million in 20 years, and it will pay out interest of
$4 million every six months for the duration of the loan. However, for some liabilities it is
difficult to estimate the amount of the obligation. For example, a firm that is responsible
for an environmental cleanup clearly has incurred an obligation, but the amount is highly
uncertain.13 Similarly, firms that provide PEnsion and post-retirement benefits for employees have incurred commitments that dePEnd on uncertain future events, such as employee
mortality rates and future inflation rates, making valuation of the obligation subjective.
Future warranty and insurance claim obligations fall into the same category--the commitment is clear but the amount dePEnds on uncertain future events.
Accounting rules frequently sPEciFY when a commitment has been incurred and how to
measure the amount of the commitment. However, as discussed earlier, accounting rules
are imPErfect--they cannot cover all contractual possibilities and reflect all of the complexities of a firm's business relationships. They also require managers to make subjective estimates of future events to value the firm's commitments. Thus the analyst may decide that
some important obligations are omitted from the financial statements or, if included, are
understated, either because of management bias or because there are legitimate differences
Implementing Accounting Analysis 4-21
in opinion between managers and analysts over future risks and commitments. As a result,
analysis of liabilities is usually with an eye to assessing whether the firm's financial commitments and risks are understated and/or its earnings overstated.
Understated Liabilities
Liabilities are likely to be understated when the firm has key commitments that are difficult to value and therefore not considered liabilities for financial reporting purposes.
Understatements are also likely to occur when managers have strong incentives to overstate the soundness of the firm's financial position or to boost reported earnings. By
understating leverage, managers present investors with a rosy picture of the firm's financial risks. Earnings management also understates liabilities (namely deferred or unearned
revenues) when revenues are recognized upon receipt of cash, even though not all services have been provided.
The most common forms of liabilities understatements arise when the following conditions exist:
1. Unearned revenues are understated through aggressive revenue recognition. If cash
has already been received but the product or service has yet to be provided,
unearned or deferred revenues are created. This liability reflects the company's
commitment to provide the service or product to the customer and is extinguished
once that is accomplished. Firms that recognize revenues prematurely--after the
receipt of cash but prior to fulfilling their product or service commitments to
customers--understate deferred revenue liabilities and overstate earnings. Firms
that bundle service contracts with the sale of a product are particularly prone to
deferred revenue liability understatement since separating the price of the product
from the price of the service is subjective.
2. Loans from discounted receivables are off balance sheet. As discussed earlier, receivables that are discounted with a financial institution are considered "sold" if the
"seller" cedes control over the receivables to the financier. Yet if the sale PErmits
the buyer to have recourse against the seller in the event of default, the seller continues to face collection risk. Given the management judgment involved in forecasting default and refinancing costs, as well as the incentives faced by managers
to keep debt off the balance sheet, it is important for the analyst to evaluate the
firm's estimates for default as well as the inherent commitments that it has for discounted receivables. Are the firm's estimates reasonable? Is it straightforward to
forecast the costs of the default and prepayment risks? If not, does the analyst
need to increase the value of the recourse liability? Or, in the extreme, does the
analyst need to undo the sale and recognize a loan from the financial institution
for the discounted value of the receivables?
3. Long-term liabilities for leases are off balance sheet. As discussed earlier in the
chapter, key lease assets and liabilities can be excluded from the balance sheet if
the company structures lease transactions to fit the accounting definition of an
oPErating lease. Firms that groom transactions to avoid showing lease assets and
obligations will have very different balance sheets from firms with virtually identical economics but which either use capital leases or borrow from the bank to actually purchase the equivalent resources. For firms that choose to structure lease
transactions to fit the definition of an oPErating lease, the analyst can restate the
leases as capital leases, as discussed in the Asset Understatement SECtion. This will
ensure that the firm's true financial commitments and risks will be reflected on its
balance sheet, enabling comparison with PEer firms.
4-22 PART 2 Business Analysis and Valuation Tools
EXAMPLES OF HOW TO CORRECT FOR LIABILITY UNDERSTATEMENT
The following examples illustrate some of these tyPEs of liability understatements and
the corrections that an analyst can make to reduce bias in the financial statements.
Unearned Revenues Understated
Hansen Medical, Inc., is a U.S. provider of advanced medical robotics. Its Sensei Robotic
Catheter System was designed to allow physicians to accurately position, manipulate, and
control catheters, and had gained acceptance in hospitals globally. Typically, ownership
of the Sensei system passed to customers upon shipment, at which point revenues were
recognized. However, a large PErcentage of the sales contracts for systems included
installation and training. In such instances, since these services were significant, Hansen
deferred all system revenues until training and installation were completed.
The company went public in 2006 and raised funds through subsequent public offerings
in 2008, 2009, and 2010. During this PEriod it also formed key partnership agreements with
larger medical device companies such as Philips Healthcare and GE Healthcare. However,
following its IPO, Hansen consistently missed analyst exPEctations and generated losses.
In October 2009, a whistleblower alleged that Hansen had recognized revenues from
the sale of some of its Sensei systems upon shipment, prior to completion of the system
installation, setup, and training. After an investigation, the company determined that it
would have to restate its financial results for 2007, 2008, and the fIRSt part of 2009, reducing revenues for these PEriods by $7.4 million, $6.8 million for 2008 alone. The adjustment
required to correct Hansen's 2008 financials (as reported in its 10-K) would be as follows:
1. Sales would decline and unearned revenues (included in Other Current Liabilities)
would increase by $6.8 million.
2. Cost of Sales would decline and Deferred Cost of Sales (included in Other Current
Assets) would increase by $2.4 million to reflect the lower sales.
3. Since Hansen had reported losses since its inception, the restatement would not affect
its tax position, requiring no adjustment to Tax ExPEnse or to Deferred Taxes.
The full effect of the adjustment on the 2008 financial statements would therefore be
as follows:

The restatement reduced Hansen's previously reported revenues for 2008 by 22 PErcent and was accompanied by a drop in the firm's stock price of 9 PErcent on the
announcement date, and 22 PErcent for the month (versus a 1 PErcent increase for the
S&P 500 during that same PEriod).

Implementing Accounting Analysis 4-23
Equity Distortions
Accounting treats stockholders' equity as a residual claim on the firm's assets after paying off the other claimholders. Consequently, equity distortions arise primarily from distortions in assets and liabilities. For example, distortions in assets or liabilities that affect
earnings also lead to distortions in equity. However, equity distortions can also arise that
are not captured in an asset and liability analysis. One such distortion is for hybrid
SECurities.
Hybrid SECurities include convertible debt and debt with warrants attached. These
SECurities are partially pure debt and partially equity. Current U.S. accounting rules do
not separate these components, typically implying that the balance sheet overstates firm
debt and understates its equity. Without adjusting for this distortion, it can be difficult
to understand the real financial risks and returns for firms with different tyPEs of
hybrids. New accounting rules being considered in a joint FASB/IASB project are likely
to address this issue by requiring SECurities such as convertible debt to be separated into
two components on the balance sheet, a debt component and an equity component.
Each would be valued at its fair value at the date of issue. This appROAch could be
adopted by the analyst.
EXAMPLE OF HOW TO CORRECT FOR EQUITY DISTORTIONS
We illustrate the equity distortion arising from the issuance of hybrid SECurities and the
corrections that the analyst can make to reduce bias in the financial statements.
Hybrid SECurities
On October 27, 2009, Navistar International Corp. completed an offering of $550 million
of 3.0 PErcent Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due in 2014. At the same time,
the company also issued $1.0 billion in Senior UnSECured Notes with an annual interest
rate of 8.25 PErcent. The premium for conversion rights was therefore significant.
The net present value of the $550 million convertible issue at an 8.25 PErcent discount
rate is $434 million, implying that the convertibility premium was worth roughly $116 million. One way to adjust for this effect is to record the debt component at $434 million and
to show the $116 million conversion premium as part of Common Shareholders' Equity.
Interest on the debt would then be based on the 8.25 PErcent coupon rate of the straight
note rather than the 3.0 PErcent (which reflects the conversion premium).
The effect of this adjustment on Navistar's financial statements at December 31, 2009,
would be as follows:

COMPARING COMPANIES USING U.S. GAAP AND IFRS
In Chapter 3 we discussed the joint convergence project being undertaken by FASB and
the IASB that has succeeded in reducing many of the differences between U.S. GAAP
and IFRS. Many of the remaining differences are likely to have relatively minor effects
on financial statement comparability, making it easier for analysts to compare the PErformance of companies using different standards.
Nonetheless, a few important differences remain. Some of these arise from differences
in the way that U.S. and international standard setters have opted to trade-off the relevance and reliability of financial information. For example, in an effort to increase the
relevance of financial information, IFRS PErmits companies to revalue long-term nonfinancial assets that have appreciated in value. In contrast, U.S. GAAP places a stronger
weight on the reliability of financial information and precludes such upward revaluations. Differences can also reflect tax factors. For example, U.S. GAAP requires that
firms that use the LIFO inventory valuation method for tax purposes follow the same
method for financial reporting. LIFO is not used widely for tax purposes outside the
United States and is not PErmitted under IFRS.
Table 4-4 shows some of the remaining important differences between U.S. GAAP
and IFRS. The table also discusses the tyPEs of adjustments that analysts could make
to ensure that PErformance comparisons of companies using the two standards are
meaningful. This adjustment exercise can be challenging, particularly if information
on the accounting effects is not disclosed. The adjustments we recommend take

EXAMPLES OF ADJUSTING FOR DIFFERENCES IN
U.S. GAAP AND IFRS
The following illustrates some of the differences and the adjustments that an analyst can
make to enhance the comparability of financial statements for firms using the comPEting
standards.
Long-Term Asset Impairment Reversals
Consider the case of OZ Minerals, the third largest diversified mining company in Australia, the world's SECond largest producer of zinc, and a significant producer of copPEr,
lead, gold, and silver. OZ Minerals reports under Australian Accounting Standards,
which closely follow IFRS. In 2010 the firm announced that as a result of an improved
outlook for the global economy, record copPEr prices, and the strong production of its
Prominent Hill mine, it would increase pretax earnings by 201.1 million Australian dollars (approximately 172 million U.S. dollars) with the reversal of a 2008 impairment of
the Prominent Hill PP&E asset. This impairment reversal increased pre-tax earnings for
OZ Minerals by 44 PErcent for the year.
As shown in Table 4-4, reversals of impairments are PErmitted by IFRS but not by
U.S. GAAP. An analyst comparing OZ Minerals' PErformance with that of U.S.-based
mining companies such as Freeport-McMoRan CopPEr & Gold Inc., a major copPEr producer that also took a significant impairment charge in 2008, could therefore add back
the reversal to OZ Minerals' earnings (with an adjustment for tax effects) as follows:

Implementing Accounting Analysis 4-27
The add back of the impairment reversal reduces OZ Minerals' return on equity
(ROE) from 18.4 PErcent to 13.9 PErcent.
LIFO Inventory Valuation
is the world's leading manufacturer of construction and mining
Caterpillar, Inc.,
machines and related equipment. In 2010, Caterpillar used the last-in, fIRSt-out (LIFO)
valuation method for approximately 70 PErcent of its inventories. An analyst wanting
to compare Caterpillar with the EuroPEan comPEtitor CNH Global N.V. (which reports
using IFRS) could adjust Caterpillar's inventory to approximate cost using the fIRSt-in,
fIRSt-out (FIFO) method, since IFRS does not PErmit the use of LIFO. Caterpillar reports
its LIFO reserve (the excess of estimated current costs over LIFO carrying value) as
$2,575 million in 2010 and $3,022 million in 2009. The following adjustments to Caterpillar's financials reflect the cumulative effect of using LIFO at the end of FY 2009 and
the incremental impact for FY 2010:
1) Add Caterpillar's LIFO reserve at the end of FY 2009, $3,022 million, to its inventory balance at the end of 2009, to revalue inventory to FIFO.
2) The cumulative inventory adjustment also increases equity at the end of FY 2009
and will require an adjustment to the Deferred Tax Liability. Given Caterpillar's
tax rate of 35 PErcent, this effect is $1,058 million.
3) To make the incremental adjustment for FY 2010, the analyst will lower inventory by
$447 million to reflect the decline in the LIFO reserve for the year ($2,575 million (cid:2)
$3,022 million) and increase cost of goods sold. This increase in exPEnses will be offset
by a decline in the tax exPEnse for $156 million ($447 million (cid:3) the tax rate of
35 PErcent) and a decline in Deferred Tax Liability. The impact on net income and
equity is therefore (cid:2)$291 million ((cid:2)$447 million th $156 million).
A summary of these entries is as follows:

Caterpillar reports inventory turnover (cost of goods sold to average inventory) of 3.8 for
2010, the same as reported by its comPEtitor CNH. However, after restating Caterpillar's
financials to FIFO, its turnover declines to 2.9, indicating that it actually underPErforms
its rival.
Off Balance Sheet Discounted Receivables with Recourse
Tecumseh Products Company is a global manufacturer of compressors for residential
and commercial air conditioning and refrigeration applications. It has manufacturing
4-28 PART 2 Business Analysis and Valuation Tools
and assembly plants in the United States, Brazil, France, India, Canada, Mexico, Malaysia, and China. The company's Brazilian and Indian subsidiaries PEriodically factor their
accounts receivables to financial institutions, both with and without recourse. The sale of
receivables with recourse creates a contingent liability. Tecumseh reported that in 2010
receivables sold with "limited recourse liability" amounted to $19.4 million, 15 PErcent of
reported receivables.
Since Tecumseh is a U.S. company, it will show the receivables factored with recourse as
sold. The financing will therefore not apPEar on its balance sheet as a loan, and its receivables
will be excluded from current assets. In contrast, other firms in the industry that use IFRS,
such as Ingersoll-Rand PLC, a company headquartered in Ireland, and Sandvik AB from
Sweden, show factored receivables and loans on their balance sheets. An analyst comparing
Tecumseh with either of these comPEtitors could therefore decide to restate Tecumseh's
financials to add back the recourse receivables sold to Tecumseh's balance sheet as follows:

On an unadjusted basis, Tecumseh apPEars to manage its receivables more closely
than its EuroPEan comPEtitors, with days' receivable of 50.0, compared to 56.3 for Sandvik and 60.8 for Ingersoll-Rand. However, when factored receivables are added back to
Tecumseh's ending 2010 accounts receivables, days' receivable increase to 57.5, comparable to its PEers.

APPLICATION TO TJX AND NORDSTROM
Let us return to the TJX and Nordstrom comparison discussed in Chapter 2. Are any of
the accounting adjustments discussed in this chapter relevant to understanding the relative PErformance of TJX and Nordstrom? Would it make sense for an analyst covering
the two companies to make any of the adjustments?
One potentially important accounting difference is that TJX Companies, Inc.
leases virtually all of its stores using oPErating leases, whereas a significant portion
of Nordstrom's stores are owned or leased under capital
leases. As a result, TJX
omits many more of its critical assets and lease obligations from its balance sheet
than Nordstrom, making it challenging to compare the two firms asset intensity
and financial leverage.
To evaluate how the difference in store ownership/leasing affects the financial PErformance of TJX and Nordstrom, the analyst can use information on lease commitments
presented in the financial statement footnotes to estimate the value of the assets and liabilities that are omitted from the balance sheet. The leased proPErty is subsequently
depreciated over the life of the lease, and the lease payments are treated as interest and
debt repayment. We show these computations for TJX below and present comparable
adjustments for Nordstrom's oPErating leases in ApPEndix B.
To estimate the value of the oPErating lease assets and liabilities, we use information
on the future minimum oPErating lease payments provided by TJX in its financial
Implementing Accounting Analysis 4-29
statement footnotes. For the years ending January 29, 2011, and January 30, 2010, these
amounts were as follows:

$1,005,366
1,771,055
1,307,773
1,610,867
$5,695,061
TJX estimated the net present value of its minimum future lease obligations was
$5,572.6 million on January 29, 2011, and $4,450.2 million on January 30, 2010. In addition, it reported that the average interest rate on its long-term debt was 5.5 PErcent.
Based on the data on general lease terms given in the financial statements, we assume
that the average lease term is 15 years. Given this information, the analyst can make
the following adjustments to TJX's beginning and ending balance sheets, and to its
income statement for the year ended January 29, 2011:
1. Capitalize the net present value of the minimum lease obligations as of January 30,
increasing Long-Term Tangible Assets and Long-Term Debt by $4,450.2
2010,
million.14
2. Calculate the value of any change in lease assets and lease liabilities during the year
from new lease transactions or terminations. On January 30, 2010, TJX's liability for
oPErating lease commitments in 2011 and beyond was $4,450.2 million. During
2010, the company exPEcted to repay $1,005.4 million (as PEr the schedule above),
comprising $244.8 million of interest (5.5 PErcent of $4,450.2 million) and the
remaining $760.6 million as retirement of the lease liability. If there had been no
new lease commitments added during the year, the oPErating lease liability on January 29, 2011, would therefore have been $3,689.6 million ($4,450.2 million (cid:2) $760.6
million). Yet TJX's actual lease commitment on January 29, 2011, was $5,572.6 million, indicating that it increased its leased store capacity by $1,883.0 million. TJX's
Long-Term Tangible Assets and Long-Term Debt therefore increased by $1,883.0
million during 2010 as a result of net new lease commitments.
3. Record the change in lease asset value and exPEnse from depreciation during the
year. Using a fifteen-year life and straight-line depreciation, the depreciation exPEnse
for 2010 (included in Cost of Sales) is $359.4 m {[$4450.2 m th ($1,883.0 m/2)]/15}.
4. Add back the lease exPEnse in the income statement, included in Cost of Sales, and
apportion the payment between Interest ExPEnse and repayment of Long-Term
Debt. As previously mentioned, the lease exPEnse is $1,005.4 million. As noted
above, this reflects $244.8 million ($4,450.2 m (cid:3) 5.5 PErcent) that is shown as
Interest ExPEnse and the remaining $760.6 million is allocated toward retiring the
total oPErating lease liability.
5. Make changes to the Deferred Tax Liability to reflect differences in earnings under
the capital and oPErating methods. If it capitalizes oPErating leases, TJX's exPEnses
are $604.2 million ($359.4 million depreciation exPEnse plus $244.8 million interest
exPEnse) versus $1,005.4 million under the oPErating method, a difference of
$401.2 million. TJX will not change its tax books, but for financial reporting purposes it will show higher earnings before tax and thus a higher Tax ExPEnse
through deferred taxes. Given a corporate tax rate of 35 PErcent, Tax ExPEnse will
increase by $140.4 million ($401.2 million x .35) and the Deferred Tax Liability
will increase by the same amount for the year ended January 29, 2011.

In summary, the adjustments to TJX's financial statements on January 30, 2010, and

SUMMARY
The increase in both TJX's long term asset and liability balances and related income
statement impact resulting from the above adjustment significantly alters many of the
financial ratios that an analyst uses to understand and categorize a firm's PErformance.
In the next chapter we will look at these ratios in detail, comparing TJX and Nordstrom
on both an unadjusted and adjusted basis.
To implement accounting analysis, the analyst must fIRSt recast the financial statements
into a common format so that financial statement terminology and formatting is comparable between firms and across time. A standard template for recasting the financials,
presented in this chapter, is used throughout the remainder of the book.
Once the financial statements are standardized, the analyst can determine what
accounting distortions exist in the firm's assets, liabilities, and equity. Common distortions that overstate assets include delays in recognizing asset impairments, underestimated reserves, aggressive revenue recognition leading to overstated receivables, and
optimistic assumptions on long-term asset depreciation. Asset understatements can
arise if managers overstate asset write-offs, use oPErating leases to keep assets off the balance sheet, or make conservative assumptions for asset depreciation. They can also arise
because accounting rules require outlays for key assets (e.g., R&D and brands) to be
immediately exPEnsed. For liabilities, the primary concern for the analyst is whether the
firm understates its real commitments. This can arise from off-balance liabilities (e.g.,
oPErating lease obligations), and from aggressive revenue recognition that understates
unearned revenue obligations. Equity distortions frequently arise when there are distortions in assets and liabilities. However, they can also arise if firms issue hybrid SECurities.
Implementing Accounting Analysis 4-31
Adjustments for distortions can,
therefore, arise because accounting standards,
although applied appropriately, do not reflect a firm's economic reality. They can also
arise if the analyst has a different point of view from management about the estimates
and assumptions made in preparing the financial statements. Finally, adjustments may
be necessary for the analyst seeking to compare companies reporting under different
accounting standards (bROAdly represented as U.S. GAAP and IFRS) in order to ensure
that the data to be analyzed are comparable.
Once distortions have been identified, the analyst can use footnote and cash flow
statement information to make adjustments to the balance sheet at the beginning and/
or end of the current year, as well as any needed adjustments to revenues and exPEnses
in the latest income statement. This ensures that the most recent financial ratios used to
evaluate a firm's PErformance and to forecast its future results are based on financial data
that appropriately reflect its business economics.
Several points are worth remembering when doing accounting analysis. FIRSt, the bulk of
the analyst's time and energy should be focused on evaluating and adjusting accounting policies and estimates that describe the firm's key strategic value drivers. Of course, this does
not mean that management bias is not reflected in other accounting estimates and policies,
and the analyst should certainly examine these. But given the importance of evaluating how
the firm is managing its key success factors and risks, the bulk of the accounting analysis
should be sPEnt examining those policies that represent these key factors and risks.
It is also important to recognize that many accounting adjustments can only be
approximations rather than precise calculations since much of the information necessary
for making precise adjustments is not disclosed. The analyst should therefore try to avoid
worrying about being overly precise in making accounting adjustments. By making even
crude adjustments, it is usually possible to mitigate some of the limitations of accounting
standards and problems of management bias in financial reporting.

AMR further disclosed that "lease terms vary but are generally six to 25 years for
aircraft and seven to 40 years for other leased proPErty and equipment." Assuming
that all leases are for aircraft with an average lease term of 15 years, what interest
rate does AMR use to capitalize its capital leases? Use this rate to capitalize AMR's
oPErating leases at December 31, 2010. Record the adjustment to AMR's balance
sheet to reflect the capitalization of oPErating leases. How would this reporting
change affect AMR's Income Statement in 2011?

Note: The cash flow statement shows the cash flows from oPErating activities attributable to all
capital providers (debt and equity). Consequently, Net after-tax interest exPEnse (income) is added
back to Net Income in the OPErating cash flow segment and reported in the Financing segment.
Net after-tax interest exPEnse (income) is Net interest exPEnse (income) (cid:3) (1 (cid:2) Average tax rate).
APPENDIX B Nordstrom, Inc. OPErating Lease Adjustment
To estimate the value of Nordstrom's oPErating lease assets and liabilities, we use footnote information on the future minimum oPErating lease payments provided by Nordstrom in the financial statement footnotes included in its 2010 10-K. For the years
ending January 29, 2011, and January 30, 2010, these amounts were as follows:

Whereas in the TJX adjustment shown earlier in the chapter TJX provides an estimate
of the net present value of its minimum future lease obligations, Nordstrom does not
provide such an estimate. However, using Nordstrom's reported average interest rate on
its long-term debt of 6.3 PErcent, and estimating an average lease term of 18 years using
data on general lease terms given in the 10-K, we can estimate the present value of
Nordstrom's minimum lease obligations for the year ended January 29, 2011, as $685
million and for the year ended January 30, 2010, as $578 million.15 With those estimates,
we can now make the following adjustments to Nordstrom's beginning and ending balance
sheets and to its income statement for the year ended January 29, 2011:
1. Capitalize the estimated net present value of the minimum lease obligations as of January
30, 2010, increasing Long-Term Tangible Assets and Long-Term Debt by $578 million.
2. Calculate the value of any change in lease assets and lease liabilities during the year
from new lease transactions or terminations. On January 30, 2010, the estimated
present value of Nordstrom's liability for oPErating lease commitments in 2011
...................................................................................................................
15The net present value of Nordstrom's reported future oPErating lease obligation is calculated using 6.3 PErcent as
a discount rate, which represents the average of Nordstrom's long-term debt at the time, and an 18 year assumed
average lease term. The fIRSt 5 years are discounted by year as reported, with the remaining obligation (reported as
a lump sum due beyond year 5) spread on a straight line basis across years 6-18 and discounted.

and beyond was $578 million. During 2010, the company exPEcted to repay
$98 million (as PEr the schedule above), comprising $36.4 million of interest (6.3 PErcent of $578 million) and the remaining $61.6 million as retirement of the lease liability. If there had been no new lease commitments added during the year, the oPErating
lease liability on January 29, 2011, would therefore have been $516.4 million ($578
million - $61.6 million). Yet Nordstrom's actual lease commitment on January 29,
2011, was $685 million, indicating that it increased its leased store capacity by $168.6
million. Nordstrom's Long-Term Tangible Assets and Long-Term Debt therefore
increased by $168.6 million during 2010 as a result of net new lease commitments.
3. Record the change in lease asset value and exPEnse from depreciation during the year.
Using an eighteen-year life and straight-line depreciation, the depreciation exPEnse for
2010 (included in Cost of Sales) is $36.8 million {[$578 m th ($168.6 m/2)]/18}.
4. Add back the lease exPEnse in the income statement, included in Cost of Sales, and
apportion the payment between Interest ExPEnse and repayment of Long-Term Debt.
As previously mentioned, the lease exPEnse is $98 million. As noted above, this reflects
$36.4 million ($578 m (cid:3) 6.3 PErcent) that is shown as Interest ExPEnse and the
remaining $61.6 million is allocated toward retiring the total oPErating lease liability.
5. Make changes to the Deferred Tax Liability to reflect differences in earnings under
the capital and oPErating methods. If it capitalizes oPErating leases, Nordstrom's
exPEnses are $73.2 million ($36.8 million depreciation exPEnse plus $36.4 million
interest exPEnse) versus $98 million under the oPErating method, a difference of
$24.8 million. Nordstrom will not change its tax books, but for financial reporting
purposes it will show higher earnings before tax and thus a higher Tax ExPEnse
through deferred taxes. Given a corporate tax rate of 35 PErcent, Tax ExPEnse will
increase by $8.7 million ($24.8 million (cid:3) .35) and the Deferred Tax Liability will
increase by the same amount for the year ended January 29, 2011.
In summary, the adjustments to Nordstrom's financial statements on January 30,
2010, and January 29, 2011, are as follows:
