The world economy or global economy is the economy of all humans in the world, referring to the global economic system, which includes all economic activities conducted both within and between nations, including production, consumption, economic management, work in general, financial transactions and trade of goods and services.

In some contexts, the two terms are distinct: the 'international' or 'global economy' is measured separately and distinguished from national economies, while the 'world economy' is simply an aggregate of the separate countries' measurements. Beyond the minimum standard concerning value in production, use and exchange, the definitions, representations, models and valuations of the world economy vary widely.

It is common to limit questions of the world economy exclusively to human economic activity, and the world economy is typically judged in monetary terms, even in cases in which there is no efficient market to help valuate certain goods or services, or in cases in which a lack of independent research, genuine data or government cooperation makes calculating figures difficult.

Between 1820 and 2000, global income inequality increased with almost 50%. However, this change occurred mostly before 1950. Afterwards, the level of inequality remained mostly stable. It is important to differentiate between between-country inequality, which was the driving force for this pattern, and within country inequality, which remained largely constant.

As of 2000, a study by the World Institute for Development Economics Research at United Nations University found that the richest 1% of adults owned 40% of global assets, and that the richest 10% of adults accounted for 85% of the world total. The bottom half of the world adult population owned barely 1% of global wealth.

Despite high levels of government investment, the global economy decreased by 3.4% in 2020 in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, an improvement from the World Bank's initial prediction of a 5.2 percent decrease. Cities account for 80% of global GDP, thus they faced the brunt of this decline.

The world economy increased again in 2021 with an estimated 5.5 percent rebound.

As of 2025, the following 21 countries or collectives have reached an economy of at least US$2 trillion by Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in nominal or Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) terms: Brazil, Canada, China, Egypt, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Poland, South Korea, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the United States, the European Union and the African Union.

World economy refers to the economies of the world as a whole, encompassing all economic activities and interactions among countries. It includes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services on a global scale.

Statistical indicators are essential for understanding the world economy. These include metrics such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP), unemployment rates, inflation rates, and trade balances, which provide insights into economic performance and health.

Finance plays a crucial role in the world economy, involving the management of money, investments, and financial instruments. It includes banking systems, capital markets, and the flow of funds across borders.

Employment statistics are vital for assessing economic conditions. They reflect the labor market's health, including job creation, unemployment rates, and workforce participation.

The world economy comprises various industries, including manufacturing, services, agriculture, and technology. Each sector contributes differently to economic growth and development.

Energy resources are fundamental to the world economy, influencing production processes and consumption patterns. The transition to renewable energy sources is a significant trend affecting global economic dynamics.

Cross-border trade involves the exchange of goods and services between countries, impacting economic relationships and growth. Trade agreements and tariffs play a significant role in shaping these interactions.

The concept of a gift economy, where goods and services are exchanged without explicit agreements for immediate or future rewards, presents an alternative perspective on economic interactions and social relationships.

Communications technology has transformed the world economy by facilitating global interactions, enhancing information flow, and enabling remote work and digital commerce.

Transport systems are critical for the world economy, enabling the movement of goods and people. Infrastructure investments in transportation can significantly impact economic growth.

Military expenditures and defense industries also influence the world economy, affecting national budgets and international relations.

Investment in science, research, and development is essential for innovation and economic advancement, driving productivity and competitiveness in the global market.

The management of natural resources and environmental sustainability is increasingly recognized as vital for long-term economic stability and growth, influencing policies and practices worldwide.

The historical development of the world economy reflects the evolution of trade, industry, and finance over time, shaped by technological advancements and geopolitical changes.

Economic studies encompass various theories and models that analyze the functioning of economies, providing insights into policy-making and economic strategies.

To promote exports, many government agencies publish on the web economic studies by sector and country.
Among these agencies include the USCS (US DoC) and FAS (USDA) in the United States, the EDC and AAFC in Canada, Ubifrance in France, the UKTI in the United Kingdom, the HKTDC and JETRO in Asia, Austrade and the NZTE in Oceania.
Through Partnership Agreements, the Federation of International Trade Associations publishes studies from several of these agencies (USCS, FAS, AAFC, UKTI, and HKTDC) as well as other non-governmental organizations on its website globaltrade.net.

GDP (GWP) (gross world product): (purchasing power parity exchange rates) – $59.38 trillion (2005 est.), $51.48 trillion (2004), $23 trillion (2002). The GWP is the combined gross national income of all the countries in the world. When calculating the GWP, add GDP of all countries. Also, GWP shows that imports and exports are equal. Because imports and exports balance exactly when considering the whole world, this also equals the total global gross domestic product (GDP). According to the World Bank, the 2013 nominal GWP was approximately US$75.59 trillion. In 2017, according to the CIA's World Factbook, the GWP was around US$80.27 trillion in nominal terms and totaled approximately 127.8 trillion international dollars in terms of purchasing power parity (PPP). The per capita PPP GWP in 2017 was approximately Int$17,500 according to the World Factbook.
GDP (GWP) (market exchange rates) – $60.69 trillion (2008). The market exchange rates increased from 1990 to 2008. The reason for this increase is the world's advancement in terms of technology.
GDP (real growth rate): The following part shows the GDP growth rate and the expected value after one year.
Developed Economies. A developed country, industrialized country, more developed country (MDC), or more economically developed country (MEDC), is a sovereign state that has a developed economy and advanced technological infrastructure relative to other less industrialized nations. Most commonly, the criteria for evaluating the degree of economic development are gross domestic product (GDP), gross national product (GNP), the per capita income, level of industrialization, amount of widespread infrastructure and general standard of living. Which criteria are to be used and which countries can be classified as being developed are subjects of debate. The GDP of the developed countries is predicted to fall from 2.2% in 2017 to 2.0% in 2018 due to the fall in dollar value.
Developing Countries. A developing country is a country with a less developed industrial base (industries) and a low Human Development Index (HDI) relative to other countries. However, this definition is not universally agreed upon. There is also no clear agreement on which countries fit this category. A nation's GDP per capita, compared with other nations, can also be a reference point. In general, the United Nations accepts any country's claim of itself being "developing". The GDP of the developing countries is expected to rise from 4.3% in 2017 to 4.6% in 2018 due to political stability in those countries and advancement in technology.
Least developed countries. The least developed countries (LDCs) is a list of developing countries that, according to the United Nations, exhibit the lowest indicators of socioeconomic development, with the lowest Human Development Index ratings of all countries in the world. The concept of LDCs originated in the late 1960s and the first group of LDCs was listed by the UN in its resolution 2768 (XXVI) of 18 November 1971. This is a group of countries that are expected to improve their GDP from 4.8% in 2017 to 5.4% in 2018. The predicted growth is associated advancement in technology and industrialization of those countries for the past decade.
GDP – per capita: purchasing power parity – $9,300, €7,500 (2005 est.), $8,200, €6,800 (92) (2003), $7,900, €5,000 (2002)
World median income: purchasing power parity $1,041, €950 (1993)
GDP – composition by sector: agriculture: 4%; industry: 32%; services: 64% (2004 est.)
Inflation rate (consumer prices); In economics, inflation is a general rise in the price level in an economy over a period of time, resulting in a sustained drop in the purchasing power of money. When the general price level rises, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services; consequently, inflation reflects a reduction in the purchasing power per unit of money – a loss of real value in the medium of exchange and unit of account within the economy. The opposite of inflation is deflation, a sustained decrease in the general price level of goods and services. The common measure of inflation is the inflation rate, the annualized percentage change in a general price index, usually the consumer price index, over time. national inflation rates vary widely in individual cases, from declining prices in Japan to hyperinflation in several Third World countries (2003):
World 2.6% (2017), 2.8% (predicted 2018);
Developed Economies 1% to 4% typically
Developing Countries 5% to 60% typically
Least developed countries 11.4% (2017), 8.3% (predicted 2018)
Derivatives OTC outstanding notional amount: $601 trillion (Dec 2010)
Derivatives exchange traded outstanding notional amount: $82 trillion (June 2011)
Global debt issuance: $5.187 trillion, €3 trillion (2004), $4.938 trillion, €3.98 trillion (2003), $3.938 trillion (2002)
Global equity issuance: $505 billion, €450 billion (2004), $388 billion. €320 billion (2003), $319 billion, €250 trillion (2002)

Unemployment rate: 8.7% (2009 est.). 30% (2007 est.) combined unemployment and underemployment in many non-industrialized countries; developed countries typically 4%–12% unemployment.

Industrial production growth rate: 3% (2002 est.)

The period since 1950 has brought "the most rapid transformation of the human relationship with the natural world in the history of humankind".
Through 2018, humans have reduced forest area by ~30% and grasslands/shrubs by ~68%, to make way for livestock grazing and crops for humans.
* Estimated number of trees that are net lost annually as of 2021: 10 billion
* Global annual deforested land in 2015–2020: 10 million hectares
* Global annual net forest area loss in 2000–2010 : 4.7 million hectares
* Estimated annual loss of agricultural productivity due to soil erosion: 8 billion US dollars (based on the soil erosion data)
* As of 2018, about 380 million tonnes of plastic is produced worldwide each year. From the 1950s up to 2018, an estimated 6.3 billion tonnes of plastic has been produced worldwide, of which an estimated 9% has been recycled and another 12% has been incinerated with the rest reportedly being "dumped in landfills or the natural environment".
* Number of human deaths caused annually by air pollution worldwide: ca. 7 million
* Estimated global annual cost of air pollution: $5 trillion

From the scientific perspective, economic activities are embedded in a web of dynamic, interrelated, and interdependent activities that constitute the natural system of Earth.
Novel application of cybernetics in decision-making (such as in decision-making related to process- and product-design and related laws) and direction of human activity (such as economic activity) may make it easier to control modern ecological problems.
