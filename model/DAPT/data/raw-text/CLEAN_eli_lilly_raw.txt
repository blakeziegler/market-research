Eli Lilly expects 2025 adjusted EPS to be $20.78–$22.28, down from $22.50–$24.00 due to in-process R&D charges. Still, this reflects a 66% YoY improvement.

Eli Lilly grew earnings during the last recession—a rare feat. Over the past decade, EPS CAGR was 15.9%, with stronger gains recently. Current EPS growth forecast is 20% annually through 2030, down from 30% due to a high starting base.

Dividend Growth
From 2008–2019, the dividend grew only 6 times, flat from 2009–2014. Many peers have stronger histories, but Lilly raised dividends at least 15% annually over the past 7 years. Dividend growth is expected to continue at 15% per year.

Inflation Reduction Act Impact
Signed Aug 16, 2022, the law mandates Medicare drug price negotiations starting in 2026, possibly impacting pharma profits. However, employer plans may absorb these costs. Current growth estimates are unchanged, though the impact will be monitored.

Valuation Analysis

Final Thoughts & Recommendation
Eli Lilly is expected to deliver 17.7% annual returns through 2030, down from 24.6%, driven by 20% EPS growth and 0.8% yield, slightly offset by a -2.5% headwind from multiple compression. While products continue to perform well, including Alzheimer’s therapy revenue initiation, the stock is rated Hold due to overvaluation relative to fair value.
