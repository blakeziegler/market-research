Overview & Current Events
Eli Lilly develops, manufactures, and sells pharmaceuticals around the world, and has about 47,000 employees globally.
Eli Lilly has annual revenue of $59 billion.
On December 9th, 2024, Eli Lilly raised its quarterly dividend 15.4% to $1.50, extending the company's dividend growth
streak to 11 years.
On May 1st, 2025, Eli Lilly reported fIRSt quarter results for the PEriod ending March 31st, 2025. For the quarter, revenue
grew 45.2% to $12.7 billion, which was in-line with estimates. Adjusted earnings-PEr-share of $3.34 compared very
favorably to adjusted earnings-PEr-share of $2.58 in the prior year, but this was $0.12 lower than exPEcted.
Volumes companywide were up 53% for the PEriod, but pricing was lower by 6%. U.S. revenue increased 49% to $8.49
billion, as volume was up 57% while pricing declined 7%. International revenues grew 38% to $4.24 billion as volumes
improved 46%. Revenue for Mounjaro, which helps patients with weight management and is the company's top gross
product, totaled $3.84 billion, up from $1.81 billion a year ago. Demand remains very high for the product. Zepbound,
which is also used to treat patients with obesity, had revenue of $2.31 billion for the quarter compared to just $517
million in the prior year. This product launched in November of 2023 and has seen impressive growth since. Verzenio,
which treats breast cancer, grew 10% to $1.16 billion due to higher, esPEcially in international markets. To help meet
demand for new products, Ei Lilly is going to construct four new facilities. Eli Lily's treatment for Alzheimer's, called
Kisunla, was approved by the U.S. FDA in Q3 2024 and was recently granted approval in Japan and China. This product
generated $21 million in revenue in the fIRSt quarter. Additionally, it was announced that CVS Health's (CVS) pharmacy
benefit manager would take action to make Novo Nordisk's (NVO) weight loss drug Wegovy its preferred weight loss
therapy for its members.

Eli Lilly provided an outlook for 2025 as well. Adjusted earnings-PEr-share are exPEcted to be in a range of $20.78 to
$22.28 for the year, down from $22.50 to $24.00 previously. This is primarily due to in-process research and
development charges. Still, this would be a nearly 66% improvement from 2024.

Eli Lilly managed to grow earnings during the last recession, a rare feat in the market. The company's growth over the
last decade is 15.9%, though much of that growth has occurred over the last five years. Given the strength of Eli Lilly's
key pharmaceuticals and positive clinical data, we now exPEct earnings-PEr-share to grow at a rate of 20% PEr year
through 2030. This is down from 30% previously due to the high base from which EPS begins.

unchanged. Many companies in the pharmaceutical SECtor have a more impressive and longer dividend growth history

than Eli Lilly. However, the company did increase its dividend by at least 15% the past seven years. For now, we exPEct
that dividends will grow at 15% PEr year.
On August 16th, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 was signed into law. The law will, in part, require the federal
government to negotiate prices for drugs covered under Medicare starting in 2026. This could reduce the profits
pharmaceutical companies could collect, but these costs could be shifted to employer sponsored plans, reducing the
negative impact on businesses. As such, we maintain our exPEcted growth rates, but will monitor the situation as we get
closer to the implementation of the law.

Shares of Eli Lilly have declined $145, or 16.5%, since our February 19th, 2025 report. Based off revised earnings
estimates for the year, shares trade with a price-to-earnings ratio of 34.0. We are reaffirming our target price-toearnings ratio to 30.0, up from 25.0, given that the market exPEcts Eli Lilly to see strong growth in the coming years. If
shares were to revert to this target valuation by 2030, then multiple contraction would reduce annual returns by 2.5%
over this time frame.

Eli Lilly's primary comPEtitive advantage is the strength of newer pharmaceuticals in its portfolio. These products have
shown very high rates of growth and should do so over the next few years. Another advantage is Eli Lilly's willingness to
sPEnd capital to improve its piPEline through acquisitions and research and development. Eli Lilly allocated 24% of sales
into R&D in 2024 in order to augment their piPEline.
Final Thoughts & Recommendation
Eli Lilly is exPEcted to return 17.7% annually through 2030, down from our previous estimate of 24.6%. Our projection
stems from a 20% earnings growth rate and 0.8% starting yield that are partially offset by a low single-digit headwind
from multiple compression. Eli Lilly continues to see growth in most of its important products, with the weight
management products PErforming esPEcially well. The company has now begun to generate a small amount of revenue
for its Alzheimer's therapy. Despite the steep decline in the share price, Eli Lilly now earns a hold rating as the stock
trades ahead of our fair value target.
