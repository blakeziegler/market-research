II. Structure
Structure, as used in this book, is understood as the capital structure which is
the proportion in which a company is financed by equity and debt. What is directly related to the issue of structure is mergers and valuation of the company
branches. An analysis of a company with resPEct to the options theory may also
be helpful in the process of solving the riddle of company valuation. Before we go
any further, let us once again consider the problem of changes in capital structure
- the discussion will be complementary with the one from the previous chapter.
2.1. How to determine the cost of capital.
2.1.1. Equity.
Determining the cost of capital is a difficult task. Two asPEcts have to be
taken into account: risk and a reference point (prosPEcts for the future).
1. Risk has numerous components, the most important ones being:
a) Market risk
b) OPErational risk
c) Financial risk
Market risk reflects general prosPErity or lack of it. It is extremely difficult
to succeed in a crisis while it is reasonably easy to conduct business during a
bull market. High tide raises all the boats - as technicians tend to say.There are
no good methods that may be used as a hedge against a global change affecting
individual companies. This risk is partially captured by CAPM, according to
which the required rate of return is given by the formula:
where rRF is risk-free rate of return, kM is the required rate of return on a market
portfolio, and the beta coefficient is the measure of the contribution of a single as64
set to the risk of portfolio. The idea is that the required rate of return as given by
the formula will comPEnsate investors for bearing that risk (as measured by beta).
OPErational risk deals with the uncertainty of forecasting. Estimates of
future prices of products, materials, levels of sales, or cost structure may be
wrong, hence cash flows become random. ExPEcted values of cash flows are
used in budgeting, whereas information about the probability distribution (uncertainty) of the cash flows is reflected in the cost of capital.
Debt financing increases riskiness as a company faces fixed interest payments
it has to incur, which in an extreme case may lead to bankruptcy. Quantitative relationships between the level of debt and the required rate of return for shareholders will be referred to later in Chapter 2.2.
2. Reference point and prosPEcts for the future.
This reflects a simple observation that the required rate of return dePEnds on
the share price. The higher the share price is, the lower is the rate demanded by
investors. For example, high profits generated by a company will be sooner or later reflected in its share price, and eventually cashed in by the shareholders, which
may partially satisFY the shareholders' demands with regard to their rate of return.
If the generated profits are initially low, due to, for example, weak exPErtise in
a new field, or unexPEcted failures, the shareholders tend to raise their demand
through a higher exPEcted rate of return. The problem can be illustrated by the
cost of capital formula (derived from Gordon's model):
The lower S(0), the higher k and vice versa. Div(1) represents (together with
the growth factor g) prosPEcts of the future profits and, if positive, increases k. To
be honest, the cost of capital derived from Gordon's model is usually interpreted
as an exPEcted rate of return, but on the other hand both notions: required and exPEcted rates are inseparable. Most of the markets for most of the time are in equilibrium - the high exPEcted rate of return inevitably becomes a high required rate
of return too. Otherwise, this would lead to projects with positive NPVs, which is
an anomaly in fact. It also coincides with the general idea of risk. High planned
inflows are typically riskier than lower ones and a drop in a share price signals
higher risk.
2.1.2. Structure - basics
Finding factors that are immanently important is the key to a successful
analysis of company's value with resPEct to its capital structure. Cash that is
generated by a company finds its way to one of three groups:
* shareholders
65
interest payments
tax payments
* debt holders
* government
The cash flows can be denoted as:
* dividends
*
*
The present value of the cash flows will be denoted as:
* E
* D
* G
The sum of the three gives an amount that is not affected by either the
level of tax, or changing proportions between equity and debt. If the tax
rates are altered (the government changes its fiscal policy), a different proportion of profits generated by a company goes to the government. If the tax
rate is increased, the fIRSt two groups will receive less, but the total amount
will not change. The change in capital structure will influence the amount
of paid tax, because debt is closely related to the tax shield. Tax shield is a
result of a law that enables companies to deduct interest before calculating
the amount of tax owed. Thus, the higher the debt is, the lower the tax to be
paid. The sum of the three streams of cash flows is constant, but the change
in one component is likely to affect the other two. Let us denote the sum
asVT (total):
The value of equity is the present value of cash flow for shareholders (CF),
and tax payments (TP) are (we temporarily ignore depreciation and assume that
the level of debt does not change):
We already know that:
This implies:
The same is true as far as the present values of dividends, CF and tax payments are concerned (assuming PErPEtuities). G in the formula below is the
present value of tax payments and E is the present value of cash flows.
66
The formula for the total value of a company can be rewritten as follows:
Let us suppose now that we are dealing with an unleveraged (hence subscript u) company, devoid of the tax shield effect. The value of such a company
can be shown as the sum of two components: the value of equity (no debt) and
the value of tax payments (no tax shield):
.
The values are given by:
This implies:
The same is true with regard to the present values (assuming PErPEtuities):
The relationships yield the following:
Please note that a change in T does affect Vu, since it does not affect the total value of a company. A comparison of the two formulae for the total value of
a company generates the following:
Hence:
Let us denote the cost of capital of an unleveraged company (financed by
debt only) by ku. From the portfolio theory we get the following important relationship:
67
The cost of capital does not dePEnd (by definition) on the level of debt, so
it is assumed that it is not related to any changes in the capital structure either.
Debt, cost of equity, and equity will change in a way that the right side of the
formula is unaffected.
Whenever the capital structure changes, the cost of debt, equity, and
obviously the value of equity and debt will change too. For simplicity, let us assume that the cost of debt remains the same. The formula may be now rewritten
with resPEct to the cost of equity:
There is a slight problem with applying the formula to real life calculations.
It gives us some idea of how E affects the cost of equity, but on the other hand
the very cost of capital is needed to determine the value of equity. However, we
went through the chore of solving many such problems (logical loops) in the
previous chapter.
It is worth emphasizing that in the case of a company that is partly financed
by debt, the value of the company (D + E) is bigger than the value of the company that is financed by equity only (Vu). The difference can be attributed to the
tax shield effect. For a PErPEtuity, it is TD (a product of tax rate and the value
of debt).
The formulae develoPEd so far in this SECtion were obtained for PErPEtuities. Still, they are precise enough for any other situations and are widely used
in literature. Even more precise solutions can be found in M.Capinski, "A New
Method of DCF Valuation", Nowy Sacz Academic Review, 2005/2 - they are
based on the same idea: cash flows that flow to the government, shareholders and debt holders. Using a spreadsheet and the "goal seek" tool makes it
easy to find the final values, whereas an analytic formula, though possible to
derive, would be very complicated. Here we only present the solution for a singlePEriod case.
The crucial relationship is concerned with two ways of decomposing the total value of the firm (which is the present value of the total generated cash). The
company may contribute to debt holders, shareholders and the government and
on the other hand to shareholders and the government in a hypothetical situation of an unleveraged firm with the same oPErations:
68
We then compute the value of all components at time t on the basis of known
exPEcted cash flows and the values at the end of year t +1. For notational simplicity we sett=0 and the general relationship is as before:
We assume that the cost of debt kD(0) and the cost of an unleveraged company ku(0) are given. The formula for the cost of equity ke(0) will be derived below. We assume that the values Vt(1), D(1), E(1), G (1), Vu(1), Gu (1) are known.
We identiFY some groups of cash flows at the end of year one, including:
1. Ct(1) - the total cash flow composed of the cash generated by the company together with the terminal value Vt(1), discounted by ku(0) and giving
Vt(0) ,
2. CD - the cash for debt holders composed of the interest, change of debt,
and the value of debt D(1), discounted atkD(0),
3. Ce - the cash for the shareholders composed of the cash flow at the end
of the year and the value E(1), discounted by kE(0),
4. CG - the cash for the government (taxes) including the value G(1) also
discounted by kE(0) (the taxes are proportional to the cash flow to the
shareholders so the returns are the same and so is the risk).
The inclusion of the terminal value in the cash available is justified since,
for instance, the shareholders can sell the shares and debt holders can sell the
bonds, except for the government that is regarded as an investor in an ABStract
sense.
Application of the basic idea of portfolio theory, regarding the company as a
portfolio of debt, equity and government, results in the following relationship:
In this formula the only unknown quantity is the cost of equity (kE ), and so
it can be calculated.
To complete the analysis, it is now sufficient to give the formulae for the numerators as:
In the example below, we limit ourselves to showing the PErPEtuity case.
69
Example 16.
A company exPEcts EBIT of 60 every year. The company is financed by debt of 100,
and the cost of debt is 6% (PErPEtuity too). The tax rate is 30%. We assume that the
depreciation each year is at the same level as the capital investment. We inquire
about the cost of equity and capital structure.
Calculating cash flows is quite straightforward:
Given equity
The value of equity may be estimated if the company is listed on a stock exchange. Suppose the value of equity is:
E = 300.
Then, from Gordon's model (E is equivalent to S (0), zero growth) we get:
We also receive the financial structure:
Both, the rate of return and the value of the unleveraged company can be
calculated:
70
We can also compute WACC and then find indePEndently the value of the
company:
The difference (30) stems from the fact that the company uses financial leverage and hence it is the present value of the tax shield.
Given cost of equity
Let us suppose the cost of equity (12%) was found using CAPM. The value
of equity (divide CF by kE) and the financial structure can now be easily determined:
Next, both the cost of capital and the value of an unleveraged company can
be found:
Given the cost of capital of an unleveraged company
Let us supposeku can be estimated (11%) for example as a result of a comparison with another company that is equity financed or historical data was
used for that purpose. Then:
71
2.2. Change of capital structure
The change of capital structure may be a result of a number of different
events such as: issuing new stock, taking or paying off a loan, or stock repurchase. The key problem is to assess how restructuring may affect the costs of
capital, the value of the company and equity in particular. The change may also
be caused by some alterations in share prices or debt which may result from undertaking certain investment projects.
2.2.1. PErPEtuity
The usual practice is to begin with analyzing a company, whose profits
(EBIT) are in the form of a PErPEtuity. The question posed here is how changes
in capital structure influence the value of a company.
Example 17.
Company Wardrobe Ltd.: EBIT is 200 every year and we assume that the depreciation each year is at the same level as the capital investment. The company pays
30% corporate income tax. The initial capital structure is made up of 50% debt financing, at a cost of 10%. The cost of equity is 16.8%. Raising the debt share to
60% (or lowering it to 40%) is being considered.
We can easily calculate all the elements in the valuation scheme that have
been develoPEd so far. Let us find the costs of capital:
and the value of the company, then equity and debt (according to the implied
capital structure):
We know already that using a direct valuation method will generate the
same result, as shown below:
72
The main assumption is:
The cost of capital does not change when the financial structure is altered.
An analogy which justifies this assumption is that the efficiency of the
equipment used in the production process is not related to the kind of money
(debt or equity) used to buy it. It will affect the cash flows and then indirectly
the value of the equipment though.
Increasing debt to 60%
The assumption that the cost of debt remains at the same level is made, and
yet we know that if the increase in the level of debt is dramatic, the assumption
may turn out to be false. The increased level of debt is needed for stock repurchase. What follows (according to the formula below) is an increased risk for
the rest of the shareholders:
The new financial structure changes the weights and gives us the following:
The new WACC can also be calculated:
It is lower than the one calculated for the initial (50/50) capital structure
(11.90%), so the value of the company grows:
Once the debt is known, the income statement can be drawn up and CF can
be found:
73
If we discount CF, we end up with the same value of equity as above:
The value of equity has predictably fallen, and so has the share price (assume there are 50 shares in circulation):
One may be gullible enough to think that we should purchase 10 shares since
the proportion of equity has fallen from 50% to 40%, but it is misleading. Let us
fIRSt find out the incremental increase of debt:
It is exactly the amount we have at our disposal in order to buy back the
shares (at the current price of 11.76). Thus, we can buy back the following
number of shares:
It is a fraction, but the problem is negligible - it is good enough to assume
that there are actually 50 million shares. The share price after the change in
capital structure (we divide the new value of equity by the remaining number of
shares) is:
Surprisingly enough, the share price has grown from 11.76 to 12.90, the only
reason being the change in the financing structure. This case shows the benefits
from keeping an optimal capital structure. By the way, companies often have
other reasons to buy back their own shares, for example, it is a way to boost the
share price after it has been stagnant for some time.
Lowering debt to 40%
In this case, some new stock is issued in order to pay off a part of the loan
and diminish the loan's share in the financial structure to 40%. Since the cost
of capital is already known (14%), all we need is the cost of equity and then the
new WACC (in the new capital structure):
74
Next, the new value of the company (FCFs are discounted), and the values
of debt and equity (compliant with the new 40/60 capital structure) are found:
Debt is reduced by 133.69. Another question that needs urgent answering is
the price at which the new stock should be issued. The shareholders will have access to the cash flows after the change, and consequently the share price should
change as well. We face another logical loop: the new price is needed to calculate the number of shares to issue, and the number is necessary in order to set the
new price. One way to solve the problem is to solve a system of equations, where
C is the new share price and N is the number of shares after the change:
The solutions are as follows:
A numerical solution using iterations is also a possible appROAch.
2.2.2. Company as a project
This case presents a situation in which a company undertakes an investment project that affects its capital structure, cost of capital and eventually its
value. Hypothetically, the company is reduced to the project itself, where it
begins to carry out the project and closes after a few years, when the project is
complete. The change in capital structure is inevitable when a new project is
undertaken. This time the project (to remain realistic) cannot be reduced to a
PErPEtuity - different cash flows have to be allowed in different time PEriods;
what follows is the fluctuation in the value, structure and cost of capital. The
assumption that the cost of capital is constant throughout the life of a project
is unrealistic too. Debt would have to be constantly adjusted so the capital
structure is kept as planned. In practice, there are many technical restrictions
concerned with issuing new debt, new stock, huge volatility of the share prices due to changes in interest rates, risk, etc. This makes the process undoable.
75
In the example below the level of debt, not the capital structure, will be given
every year.
Example 18.
Beginning an oPEration requires an investment of 120. The company takes 60 of
debt, and the remaining part is financed by shareholders. The debt (principal) is going to be paid off in equal installments (over the course of three years). A straight
depreciation system is used. The company forecasts oPErational profits (OP) of 60,
80, 70 at the end of the three years. Then, the oPEration is terminated (assets have
zero salvage value). The cost of debt = 6%, cost of the company (unleveraged)
= 11%, and T = 30%.
Let us begin with finding the cash flows (FCF) for the three conSECutive
years. This requires deducting depreciation and tax payments, and then adding
back depreciation.

In order to determine cash flows to the shareholders, we are also required to additionally deduct interest payments and take into account the
level of debt. The debt diminishes at the pace of 20 every year, so the correction requires us to add the depreciation of 40 and deduct the change in
debt of 20.

As susPEcted, the valuation will be recursive. We will start with finding the
value of the company in the final year and then go backwards. The values at the
end of year 2 can be found in two ways: either CFs are discounted at the cost of
equity, or FCFs are discounted at WACC. The problem lies in a loop: the costs
of capital determine the value, the value determines structure, but the structure
needs values as inputs. We have already gone through such calculations. For the
cost of equity calculations, the following formula is to be used:
Below are the results for the CF-based method and the FCF-based method
at the end of year 2:

and previously calculated values of equity or company are discounted. For example:

Please note that the values of both costs of capital in use are changed and so
is the capital structure. The reference point for the calculations are ku, kE and
the relationship (with the current D and E values) is:
Let us proceed to finding the present value. The procedure as above is rePEated.

The present value of equity is then obtained by discounting the appropriate
cash flows at the different cost of capital for each year.
Similar calculations can be PErformed for the value of the company by discounting FCFs at WACC.
The valuation can be easily applied to a company whose life span is infinite
(growing PErPEtuity after a PEriod of dynamic growth). Then, the residual value
(the infinite tail of cash flows that follows the horizon date) must be incorporated at the end of the last finite PEriod.
Finally, it is interesting to see how the APV method coPEs with this case.
The value of the company (unleveraged) is fIRSt calculated (FCFs are discounted at ku) and then compared with the values obtained so far.

2.3. Applying options
There are sophisticated models of a company's financial structure based on
derivatives, namely options. Let us consider a company that is financed partly
by debt. The debt has a form of a zero-coupon bond with one year maturity T.
The nominal value of the bond is denoted by F. It means that shareholders are
obliged to pay F to the debt holders at time T, otherwise the company goes under. Let us denote the value of a company at time T by V(T). Once the debt is
paid off (on the condition that the value of the company exceeds F ), the shareholders are left with V(T) - F. Otherwise, the company goes bankrupt and will
be taken over by the debt holders. Here is a set of possible scenarios of what the
shareholders get:
It resembles payoffs of a call option. Hence, the present value of equity is the
same as a call premium. Shareholders have the right, but not obligation, to buy
back the company (from a bank or debt holders) at the nominal price of debt.
Another option-related concept that might be useful is a put call parity:
where S(0) is the present value of the underlying instrument, C and P are
call and put premiums resPEctively, K is the strike price, and r is a risk free rate
of return. The value of the underlying instrument is then:
There are obvious analogies with the value of the company, where the underlying instrument represents the value of company V (0), known as:
80
and a call option represents equity:
Both are entered into the put call parity and yield:
The present value of debt can be found as:
If there is no risk (the value of the company exceeds F at T), the call option
is worthless and the value of debt is represented by F. If there is some risk involved, the value of the debt is decreased by the value of the put premium. In
a nutshell, it is possible that a bank will never recover the money loaned to the
company, and the bank's exposure seems bigger than the value of assets. If the
option is deep in-the-money and volatility low, the value of the put is little.
In this context, the validity of Miller-Modigliani proposition (MM argue
that in a world without taxes, both the value of a firm and its WACC would be
unaffected by its capital structure) is worth emphasizing. It can be easily proved
that the right side of the equation below does not dePEnd on K.
At fIRSt sight, it seems ridiculous since K is obviously there. However, there
is no contradiction because both put and call premiums change together with
the value of K and the changes balance each other out.
Seeing that the values of both options grow with risk, we are able to explain
the often observed conflict between shareholders and debt holders. The former
can be interested in carrying out risky projects, since it results in increased equity value at the exPEnse of the value of debt (P grows too). Here is a short illustration of this scenario.
Suppose a company is close to bankruptcy. At a nominal debt of 100, the
value of the company is below this number. Still, there is a chance to avoid
bankruptcy, since the debt is to be paid off in one year's time. The owners have
the following scenarios to choose from:
1. To oPErate safely. The result of this is that the value of the company at
time T will reach 110. At maturity the shareholders are left with 10. If
the present value of debt is 100, then at a 10% risk free rate of return, the
value of debt will reach 100e-10%= 90.48, and the value of equity is 9.52.
81
2. To take extreme risk. The risky activities are represented by two possibilities: the value of the company may be 50 or 150 at the end of the year,
both with a 50% probability. Then, the company will either go bankrupt
(making debt holders very unhappy since then they will receive only half
of the money due), or survives and then shareholders get 50. Thanks to
the call option, the exPEcted value for the shareholders is significantly
higher than in scenario 1.
The risky scenario may mean accepting a negative NPV project, which in
turn means a deterioration in the value of the company (high risk is reflected in
the high cost of capital, which lowers NPV). And yet, in spite of accepting bad
projects, the value of the company may skyrocket. Let us analyze a numerical
example.
Let us suppose a company is worth 100 today (out of which 80 can be allocated to a risky project). The exPEcted cash flows at the end of the year are 100.
When the cost of capital is higher than 25%, it clearly means a negative NPV. If
we let the cost of capital be 30%, then:
(we use continuous compounding to be in line with put call parity) and the
value of the company is 94.08. The value of equity can be represented as the
present value of exPEcted cash flows:
Debt holders are left with 71.96. Let us compare the result with the safe scenario: the value of the company has dropPEd, while at the same time the value
of equity has gone up (at the exPEnse of debt holders though).
It is worth mentioning that the above is the structural appROAch to credit risk
estimation in the simplest possible case. It may also be, and often is, the starting
point for creating software used by the financial industry to value equity.
82
2.4. Branches
We will consider a company that has a few branches sPEcializing in very
different fields. We will inquire about the cost of capital and related problems:
the value of branches and the value of the company.
2.4.1. Branches - cost of capital
Suppose that a company conducts oPErations in two fields (hardware and
software). Quite naturally questions apPEar about the cost of capital for each
of the branches and the company. The risk of creating software and the risk
of producing hardware are not identical, and hence the costs of capital should
differ too. On the other hand all the financing is provided by the company, so
the notion of the cost of capital is viewed only with resPEct to the whole company.
We will restrict ourselves to two branches only for simplicity's sake, but
the same method could be used for many more. The method is based on
CAPM. Let us start with a general proPErty: if portfolio P is composed of
two assets A and B in proportion given by the weights:
then, the simple formula for the beta of portfolio can be applied:
Let us denote the betas of the branches (the ones which we are searching for)
by ss1A, ss2A. A stands for assets and underlies the fact that the focus is on estimating the risk of the oPErational activity.
Suppose that market data can be used to determine betas of similar (in
terms of size, market position, and market share) companies. If we deal
with companies traded on a stock exchange, we have to be aware of the
fact that we actually found their equity betas, ssE. Betas of the assets can
be found from the relationship below (assume ssD=0):
83
Example 19.
Suppose that (based on data from a stock exchange) the betas of two companies
(twins of our two branches) are found (by running linear regressions). They are 1.2
and 0.8 for companies 1 and 2 resPEctively. The companies are financed by debt at
20% and 30% resPEctively.Their beta of debt is 0.1.
Betas of assets can be calculated:
The betas can also be found in a different way: ROA of the branch can be
used as a proxy of the branch's returns and regressions can be run between the
ROAs and market returns.
Now, CAPM can be followed to find the costs of capital for both branches:
Suppose the risk free rate of return is 6%, and market premium is 8%.
Then:
The next step is to find the beta and the cost of capital that reflect oPErational activity of the company: ssA, kA. The formula for the beta of portfolio can
be applied:
where the weights correspond to each branch's contribution to the company's financial standing. The weights can be based on book values (sales, oPErational profit), but comparing present value of exPEcted cash flows seems to be
more adequate (at the branch level, without interest and tax payments).
84
2.4.2. Branches - value.
Valuation of branches does not differ from the company valuation. The task
is as difficult as before. FIRSt, future cash flows have to be determined, using
historical data as the starting point, but then some extraordinary events and
projects to be undertaken by the branch have to be considered. Volatility due to
the changing market prosPErity is already included in the cost of capital.
For example, it is possible to take oPErational profit from the previous year,
separate for each of the branches, as the base for planning profits. The growth
rate must be estimated based on either historical data or prosPEct of the economy growth for the sPEcific industry in particular. Then, the time horizon has to
be determined. Dynamic growth (if predicted) cannot last too long; the PEriod
of a few years can be split into a fast growth (acquiring new markets) and stable
growth phases (natural growth of the market). Generally, an infinite life span
for each of the branches is assumed, with the tail of cash flows beyond the horizon date represented by a growing PErPEtuity. Still, we are not in the position to
find out how the capital structure affects the value of each of the branches.
Example 20.
OPErational profits of 400 and 300 are predicted at the end of the year, and growth
rate is 3% for both branches. The cost of capital is 11% and 15% resPEctively. The
company pays 30% tax. Depreciation is ignored.
The value of growing PErPEtuities is as follows:
These numbers help to determine the value of the company (V = 5250) and
each branch's share:
Now, the cost of capital of company can be calculated:
85
The value of the company can be calculated again (the 3% growth rate is the
same for each branch, so it applies to the whole company as well):
Allowing different growth rates for each of the branches makes the situation
much more complicated, but more realistic too (different industries may naturally grow at a different rates).
Example 21.
Suppose that the growth rate of the SECond branch is 5% instead of 3% (as before).
The growth of the fIRSt branch remains at 3%.
The value of the SECond branch is found (the branch is still financed by equity only):
then the value of the company V = 5600, new weights, and the cost of capital
become:
Here is an attempt to set the growth rate for the whole company. The fIRSt
step is to find the profits in the conSECutive years. After the fIRSt year we get:
and after year two:
86
Clearly the whole company does not grow monotonously, if the branches
grow at different sPEeds. Hence Gordon's model cannot be used to calculate
its value. Another problem is that the share of each of the branches will change
too, and so will the cost of capital, . Having to analyze each of the branches separately seems inescapable - the financing issue is the exception (this is provided
for the company as a whole). The problem resembles the one related to allocating a part of the fixed costs of the company to sPEcific products, commissions,
or production units. In the same spirit, financing can be proportionally allocated to different branches. Financing, however, affects the value of the company,
which creates a logical loop.
2.4.3. Debt being considered
The task of taking debt into account is simple on one condition: the capital structure is fixed. Then, the value of each of the branches can be calculated
separately (fIRSt the cost of equity, WACC, the total value of the company, and
then the values of equity and debt). The branches will grow as planned (with
3% and 5% rates), so the debt allocated to each of the branches will grow at the
same pace.
Let us consider the situation where debt is given- this will give us an opportunity to analyze the problem of allocating costs to branches.
Example 22.
Two branches are characterized by the costs of capital (unleveraged) of 11%, 15%
and growth rates of 3%, 5% resPEctively. They generate oPErational profits of 400
and 300 (zero depreciation is assumed, but if there is a need, it can be easily incorporated). The tax rate is still 30%. The company is financed by 1500 of debt, and
pays 7% APR to service the debt.
The values of the branches have already been calculated (without debt),
hence the weights are 62.5%, 37.5%. Let us accept them temporarily. It makes it
easy to calculate interest, net profits and CF.

3% of 937.50 is added to the net profit generated by the fIRSt branch. The same
procedure is applied to the other branch.
The values can be found by solving (numerically) a loop: D and E determine
the capital structure, so they are needed to calculate kE, but kE itself requires E
as an input. We still use the formula known from precious calculations:

2.4.4. Valuing a branch - structural appROAch
A company starting a new project is similar to adding a branch: what is
faced is not only sPEcific oPErational risk but also common financing. In this
context, we have the basket option. Let us consider the following example. It
mimics the one from Chapter 2.3 and represents the structural appROAch to equity valuation.
Example 23.
Take a company that is financed partly by debt. The debt has the form of a zerocoupon bond with one year maturity T. The nominal value of the bond (80) is denoted by F whichmeans that shareholders are obliged to pay F to the debt holders
at time T, otherwise the company goes under. Let us denote the value of the company at time T by V(T). Currently V is 100 and is exPEcted to be 150 or 60 at the end
of the PEriod. In addition to this, there is also a new project (branch) the company
is going to implement. The project requires an investment of 50 (denoted as B(0)),
but its value may be 80 or 30 at the end of the PEriod. The project is partly financed
by debt with the face value (denoted as D) of 20. We are assuming that the project
(branch) cannot be a separate company, since the bank would not lend money for
such a venture.
89
We will compare and contrast two ways of valuing the company: fIRSt the
company will be treated as the sum of two call options, and then SECond as the
call option on the sum (V + B). In terms of the value for the shareholders, here
are two sets of possible scenarios:
1.
versus:
2.
The hypothesis is that the call option on the sum is worth less than the sum
of the two call options.
We have demonstrated in Chapter 2.3 that the value of a company's equity
is comparable to the value of a call option on the value of the company. The option's strike price is the amount of debt to be repaid at maturity. This appROAch,
combined with the fundamental equality between put and call (known as put
call parity), yields:
where a call option (C) represents equity.The present value of debt can be found
as:
and the company value (represented by S) = the value of the call option + the
present value of debt at the risk-free rate - the value of the put option.
The value of equity for the two cases, calculated in accordance with the appROAch presented at the beginning of the chapter, is as follows: the values of the
two calls in scenario 1 are 35.5 and 31.9, whereas the value of the call in scenario 2 is 59.9 (assuming a 10% risk-free rate and 30% cost of equity).
Interestingly enough, the call option on the sum is worth less than the sum
of the two call options. This means that for sPEcific situations, when a project is
implemented within the company structure (i.e. as a branch), it adds less value
to a company than if the project was separate from the company structure (carried out as a separate company). It is easier to finance, though. This is caused
by the fact that in the SECond scenario the risk of defaulting (the event when the
creditors find themselves the unwilling owners of the company) has been diversified away.
90
2.5. Mergers and acquisitions
2.5.1. Basics of M&A
Before proceeding with a financial analysis of an M&A example, a crucial
difference between merger and acquisition terms need to be underlined. This
clarification is not only important to understand the core idea of these complex concepts, but it also has implications for judicial and tax matters.
An acquisition can be compared to a development of an existing product
line or starting a completely new venture - it is the purchase of an existing,
well-formed company (i.e. the youtube.com purchase by google.com). During this process, assets of an offered company are transferred to the acquirer.
The purchasing organization takes actual control over the other company. In
M&A practice two kinds of acquisitions are observed - a friendly takeover -
when the seller, unforced and actively, participates in the whole process, and a
hostile takeover - when the change of ownership takes place against the will
of the owners.
A merger is a process of combining two or more entities into one, through
a purchase, acquisition or pooling of interests. The merger act is usually undertaken between companies, which PErform as partners. The word "partners" should be crucial when discussing this form of business co-oPEration.
As partners, both companies involved in merger share common risk and possible gains.
Fusion and merger are two different categories due to legal provisions. Fusion is a combination of two legal entities, often with similar potential. Companies, which want to fuse, dissolve their legal identities in order to create a
new one - in practice, often the economically stronger company sustains its
legal body. In case of a merger both companies maintain their separate legal
identities.
Mergers and acquisitions are only two tyPEs of a wide range of corporate
marriages used in the modern business environment. These two forms are the
most distinctive and complex oPErations as the scoPE of changes in both parties are significant in terms of organizational structures and human resources.
Most generally we can classiFY M&As as:
1. Strategic - carried out to take advantage of prosPEctive synergy effects
and as a part of long-term development strategy.
2. Occasional - used as ad-hoc instrument of raising a company's value
by purchasing undervalued companies.
91
Another typology includes:
1. Horizontal M&A - in which companies oPErating and comPEting in the
same SECtor (comPEtitors) are combined to create a new entity. The fundamental objective of such integration is to have active influence on price
creation.
2. Vertical M&A - in which suppliers merge with buyers or distributors.
The basic reason is to eliminate costs of searching for prices, contracting, payment collection and advertising - in simple terms, bROAdly understood synergy effects. Unlike horizontal mergers, which have no sPEcific
timing, vertical mergers take place when both firms plan to integrate the
production process and capitalise on the demand for the product.
3. Conglomerate M&A - in this tyPE of merger both companies concerned
(usually oPErationally unrelated) usually maintain their autonomy and
have a large amount of sovereignty in their decision-making processes.
Vertical Mergers are divided into:
* Upstream - where companies integrate suppliers.
* Downstream - where a company expands its distribution channels with
the help of another sPEcialized company.
Conglomerate mergers are divided in the majority of literature into:
* Financial conglomerates - where a stronger company focuses on financial flows within a conglomerate and participates in strategic decisions.
* Managerial conglomerates - where the management of a stronger company not only participates in the strategic decision-making process but
also actively controls decisions at the oPErational level. This is a so-called
deep integration.
* Concentric M&A - companies try to diversiFY the branch risk and
strengthen the internal development through this tyPE of co-oPEration.
There are three basic tyPEs of concentric mergers: product-based (merger
of companies with substitute products or from similar branches), geographical-based (concentration of companies from one geographic area),
and varied concentric merger and acquisition (bargain-based merger of
unrelated companies).
Very seldom does only one tyPE of fusion take place. Usually it is matrix of
several tyPEs, which is usually a function of the market situation and strategic
objectives.
The procedures and techniques that are currently known under the term
M&A are as old as the private SECtor. The fIRSt alliances occurred in XV and
XVI century but the PEak of M&A activities was observed in XX century. The
examination of historical events and literature on the subject empirically proves
that, just as we observe waves of growth in the market, we can clearly notice
92
ups and downs in integration processes - we refer to these events as mergers
waves. Researchers on the subject and practices observed five major waves in
last century.
FIRSt wave - called the century turn wave rose during 1893 - 1904. The
United States of America was a very sPEcific market at this time because, due
to large amount of economical liberty, many companies undertook horizontal
acquisitions. This resulted in many monopolies (US Steel Corporation (now
USX), American Tobacco Company or Standard Oil of New Jersey (now Exxon)).
The SECond PEriod of dynamic growth of M&As occurred from 1916 until
1929 and was a direct consequence of economical transformation after World
War I. This wave resulted in a new market form - oligopolies. Oligopolies concentrated market leaders' capital in particular branches and SECtors, which in
fact created impossible to overcome barriers of entry into the particular SECtor.
This SECond wave was stopPEd during the Great Depression of 1929.
During the nineteen sixties a new structural form was created in the shaPE
of conglomerates. This corporate identity became popular since it diversified
oPErational risk.
The fourth wave occurred during the early nineties. During this wave a large
number of transactions was completed compared to previous PEriods, but in
terms of capital flow it was characterised by small volume. A significant number
of acquisitions during this time were attributed to hostile takeovers.
Starting from the mid-nineties the fifth wave was observed. Its rise was
stimulated by globalization processes and became the impulse for the creation
of Multi National Companies (MNC). 2000 was the year of a historical PEak of
mergers and acquisitions both in terms of number of transactions and their value. During this boom, the value of all M&A deals reached four billion dollars.
Due to the IT bubble burst in 2001, the volume and the value of transactions
drastically plummeted.
2.5.2. Reasons for M&A
A major motive for mergers and acquisitions is the realization of the synergy
effects in order to raise the efficiency in the company and to lower costs. These
synergies can be achieved in many ways. FIRStly, production-economical synergies can be achieved by raising the economies of scale, since mass production decreases the unit costs and therefore completes the rationalization gains
through staff reductions. Moreover, M&As give access to other markets and facilitate the creation of market entry barriers.
93
Reasons for Mergers or Acquisitions can be so fundamentally different; the
literature on the subject divides this rationale into three main groups.
1. Classical motives
A classic motive of M&A seeks its justification in the power of the market. By merging or acquiring comPEtitors from the same SECtor the company reduces comPEtitive pressure and wins advantages in a price war. If
a company has a monopoly position, the comPEtition completely disapPEars and the higher prices will be forced onto the market.
2. Neoclassical motives
When a company reaches its development frontier - either in a single
market or in a product category - management must decide on the future
strategy. M&As that hapPEn then are described as the neoclassical appROAch. The main sPEcific reasons are: oPErational efficiencies arising
from the economies of scale, reduction in overall costs from the joint
production of complementary products, cost cuts - this motive has become mostly quoted as raison d'etre, market power effects,development
acceleration, and bargain search - a company may seek an acquisition
because it believes its target is undervalued, and thus it is a bargain -
a good investment capable of generating a high return for the acquiring
company's shareholders.
3. Managers motives
Mergers and acquisitions are also often triggered by managers' motivations. There are a few tyPEs of such transactions: empire building syndrome (strive to grow companies as their salaries, non-wage profits, and
both business and social position dePEnd on company size), self-realisation motive (an attempt to fully show one's skills and knowledge), risk
diversification (the motive is linked to financial tensions and bankruptcy
possibility), and job sustention motive (a threat of evil acquisition by another company).
From a financial point of view M&A are motivated mostly by:
1. Cost reduction.
2. Better exploitation of the potential of a company.
a) Typically, a company has an excess of cash but suffers from a shortage of interesting projects to carry out.
b) A company cannot use the tax shield.
c) Companies with complementary resources.
3. Diversification. It is doubtful in the case of public companies - investors
can do that themselves. In case of small companies the reduction of risk
is likely to hapPEn.
94
4. Credit rating. Bigger companies may apply for bigger loans and easily
serve the existing loans.
5. Better management. Taking over another company is the simplest way to
replace an ineffective management team.
6. Increased EPS. It is doubtful whether this should be the main reason for
a merger.
2.5.3. Carrying out a merger
Mergers and acquisitions should be seen as an ordinary investment and
therefore its financing should be structured under the same rules as any other
investment. There are three basic forms of financing M&A transactions - the
acquisition by cash i.e. own resources, debt and the acquisition by stock issue.
Basically the decision about a stock swap or a cash payment influences the interests of both shareholder groups - groups from the acquiring and the acquired
company. The issue of new shares to finance the purchase has usually a negative impact on the stock prices of the company which is buying. This fact is
based on the assumption that the board of the acquiring company is willing to
pay in shares if they know that these shares are overvalued.
The acquirer may repurchase its own stock or issue new stock. The key
question, however, concerns the so-called exchange rate - how many shares of
a new company (or the one that it acquires) the shareholders of a company that
is being taken over will receive PEr each of their own current shares. The exchange rate may be determined in many different ways. Let us start with an effective market example.
Example 24.
There are 3000 shares of company A in trade and they are priced 20 each. There
are 500 shares of company B, each priced at 40.
1. One can rely on the market value of companies: A has the value of
60000, B of 20000. After the acquisition, B shareholders should have
25% shares of the new company. If A company is to issue new stock,
they should issue 1000 shares and offer 2 A shares PEr each B share. If
the existing shares are to be offered, there should be 750 shares in circulation and 1.5A/B exchange rate should apply.
95
2. Relying on share prices leads to the same result. Comparing prices indicates that 2 A shares should be offered PEr each B share.
3. Relying on EPS or profits level may lead to completely different conclusions.
Typically, the exchange rate that is eventually negotiated is higher than the
one resulting from the comparison of the values of the two companies. It is the
shareholders of the company that is acquired who often benefit from the transaction. The example above does not take into account the increased post-merger
value of companies. It is also important to sieve out the reaction of the market
that precedes the planned take-over. The share prices may have discounted the
planned post-merger benefits.
2.5.4. Hostile takeovers
Hostile takeover transactions are usually finalized through cash payments.
LBO (leveraged buyout) is a case when a group of investors acquires a company
in a transaction financed largely by debt. Immanent risk of LBOs lies in the fact
that such transactions are heavily financially leveraged. What is more, the cash
often comes from junk bonds issued to finance the acquisition. This additionally increases risk. Hence, the bonds need to offer an exceptionally high rate
of return. Ultimately, the acquired company is usually withdrawn from a stock
exchange, and radical cost reduction schemes are implemented. The economizing is enforced by high interest payments on the bonds. All in all, LBOs can
be beneficial for the acquirer (they benefit from the cost reduction scheme) and
shareholders of the acquired company (the bids are usually higher than the current market price).
Companies (management in particular) that want to avoid being taken over
use a range of defensive strategies: restructuring leading to a high tax leverage, or changes in their statute (high majority of votes needed to approve of a
merger, "golden votes" - a privileged vote, "poison pills"- provision that allows
the stockholders of a firm that is taken over by another firm to buy shares in the
SECond company at a reduced price, or issuing preemptive rights - giving stockholders the right to purchase any new shares sold by the firm).
2.5.5. Formal issues
Anti-monopoly regulations that exist in many countries may be an obstacle in the M&A process. Political interventions or social protest may also take
place, if companies that are considered "national assets" are at stake.
96
In terms of accounting rules, dePEnding on the tyPE of acquisition, the transaction can be executed through so-called "pooling-of-interests-method" or
"purchase method". In the former case, the balance sheets are simply added.
In the latter case, there usually apPEars a difference between the book value of
assets and the price. The good will (as it is called) is included in the books and
subject to depreciation. The appROAch thus has tax effects (on net profits only),
but does not affect the cash flows.
Example 25.
The SH company is composed of two oPErational units: the software unit (SU) and
the hardware unit (HU).The company is to oPErate for three years with sales of 200,
240, 270 for the SU and 150, 120, 100 for the HU. Variable costs are 50% of sales.
The units require the upfront investment of 120 and 60 resPEctively. Straight line depreciation is assumed. The cost of capital (unleveraged) for the units is 12% (SU)
and 10% (HU). The company pays 30% corporate tax.
The example is to illustrate a problem that is both a benefit and handicap
of companies that have just merged: how to exploit the synergy effect, how to
share costs, and how to use debt to finance the branches. Here we will limit
ourselves to an attempt to allocate fixed costs. The same appROAch can be used
to allocate any costs (debt, retained earnings) that are hard to classiFY as belonging to one branch only.

Having the initial book values, one can calculate cash flows and the value
of equity (which in this case is tantamount to the value of the branch/company,
since the company is financed by equity only).

wF (the ratio of each branch's (F) value to the value of the whole company) becomes a key component: it is used to find the cost of capital for the company
and allocate fixed costs.
The loop is closed when the cells for fixed costs (in bold) are filled (it is
wF's proportion of the total fixed costs for a given year). This in turn affects E,
and then wF. As a result, one can appropriately and fairly allocate fixed costs to
the branches. This relatively easy exercise may be followed when trying to allocate to the branches any other resources they share: debt, extra revenues.

2.6. Case study - valuing a company
L-ectron Ltd. is a start-up that is beginning to produce electronic devices.
Sales of 1800 EUR for five years and then 500 EUR for another three, with
costs reaching 60% of sales are predicted. The equipment needed for the start
costs 1000 EUR, and it is 50% financed by a 5-year loan taken at 12% APR.
The costs of equity (which finances the rest) is 34%. Some more equipment will
have to be bought during the fIRSt three years - each year 100 EUR is planned
to be sPEnt. The equipment is subject to straight line depreciation schedule. The
company pays 25% corporate tax. What is the value of the company?
As the above question suggests, the purpose of the case is to valuate the
company. We will use techniques described in the two previous chapters. Calculating cash flows is relatively easy.

For the time being, the cost of capital of an unleveraged company ku is assumed to be 25%. As a matter of fact the cost of equity kE is known, but the valuation is recursive and is going to start from the year 8 - the cost of equity then
is still a mystery.

The table above shows formulae for the cells in columns for year 0 and 1.
The table starts in the top left corner of the spreadsheet. This is cell A1. The
unshaded cell in the spreadsheet is represented by B17.
The final maneuver that must be undertaken is to use the GoalSeek tool
and change kE. The one resulting from our calculation apPEars to be 30%. We
know, however, that it should be 34% - the number from our initial calculations based on year 0 data. As a matter of fact, it is kU that must be changed
in such a way that kE is 34%. After the change, the value of the company is finally known: E = 977, V = 1477.

III. Risk
The risk notion involves uncertainty with regard to future events. We are
aware of the fact that future cash flows cannot be precisely predicted. Suppose,
we consider cash flows in one year's time - there is a range of numbers that dePEnd on various factors. Thus, we typically use exPEcted values, and risk is seen
as the probability distribution of these values. The distribution can be measured
and modeled (taking into account the fact that we will be able to take decisions
after certain scenarios materialize with the use of decision trees technique).
3.1 Measures of risk
3.1.1. Variance and the like
Variance is the most commonly used measure of risk (or its square root -
standard deviation). It measures deviations from the exPEcted value. For an unknown future value denoted by X, its exPEcted value is defined as:
where X1, X2, ... are the conSECutive values of random variable X (in conSECutive
scenarios), and p1, p2, ... are the corresponding probabilities. Variance (square
root of standard deviation) is given by the formula:
Example 26.
For simplicity, let us consider just two scenarios of future returns. Here are the
data:
Scenarios
1
2
Returns
30%
-15%
Probabilities
0.4
0.6
104
Both the exPEcted value (3%) and standard deviation (22.05%) can be easily
calculated. Suppose that a more precise analysis of the project makes us veriFY
the return in the optimistic scenario, which turns out to be 40% instead of 30%.
The exPEcted value grows to 7%, and standard deviation to 26.94%.
The result contradicts our intuition, since the modified project is not any
riskier. The deviations are in fact bigger, but the returns more favorable. We accept that risk is defined as the measure of deviations but the intuitive definition
of risk says that it is exposure to loss. To capture the contradiction, a modification of variance notion is introduced and called semi-variance. The formula is
similar, but only results represented by the scenarios in which returns are lower
than the exPEcted one are calculated:
Example 27.
In this example, semi-standard deviation is 13.94% for returns of 30% and -15%,
and 17.04% for the modified returns (40%, -15%).
The attempt to enhance variance as measure of risk was evidently a failure.
In spite of rejecting the positive scenario, the variance grows which still does
not agree with our intuition. The reason is simple: after the modification the exPEcted value grows, and then so does the semi-variance.
Another attempt to improve the risk measure is to reject the exPEcted value
as a reference point. Let us use another fixed target rate (risk free rate, for example) and calculate semi-variance (below target) again:
Example 28.
Take the target rate k = 10%, then b = 19.36%, whose value does not change if 30%
return is replaced with 40%. If, however, the unfavorable return changes into even
less favorable (for example, it changes from -15% to -20%), the semi-variance (below target) falls (to 23.34%). Now, the model works as designed.
Another philosophy often adopted to measure risk is based on setting certain limits beyond which returns (or value of investment portfolio, or the level
of net profit) become unacceptable. Setting the limit is up to an individual in105
vestor. Even then, however, there is a hard floor determined by the economic
and financial circumstance the investor cannot ignore.
Example 29.
Suppose a company exports goods worth 100 000 EUR. Their costs are 320 000
PLN at most, but shareholders demand 16% return on the equity whose value is
200 000 PLN. The company has bought a put option with a 3.8 PLN/EUR strike. If
the exchange rate falls below the strike, the company will exercise the option, sell
euros at the rate, and receive 380 000 PLN, which will cover both the costs and the
dividend (there will be 20 000 PLN left)
Let us suppose, however, that the options the company has bought have
a strike of 3.4. Then the final number becomes negative (-20 000 PLN). The
number that distinguishes the unfavorable results (in this case it is simply loss)
from the good ones could be a measure of risk. The notion of risk presented
here is quite flexible. Value at Risk (VaR) exemplifies the use of the concept in
practice.
3.1.2. Value at Risk
VaR is a measure of risk that is becoming more and more popular. Its focus
is on risk as a loss, but it also takes into account probabilities with which the
event (loss) will occur.
When VaR is defined, fIRSt it is usually assumed that future returns are normally distributed. The distribution is determined by a function denoted by N(x)
(cumulated normal distribution). In spreadsheets the function is available as:
NORMDIST(x).
The function yields the probability that a random return is lower than x. The
underlying assumption is that the exPEcted value is zero and standard deviation
is 1.
106
Example 30.
Let us suppose that some analysis proves that the exPEcted return is 25%, and
standard deviation is 20%.
We pose the following question: what is the probability that the return we
are facing in the nearest PEriod of time will be lower than 30%? Let us calculate
x from the formula below:
And then we find:
If the return we mean is based on the share price (today the price is 57), then
it can be said that with 60% probability at the end of the PEriod the price will
fall below:
or with 40% probability will go above 74.10.
The method applied above can also help answer the important question:
what is the limit such that the future return (or asset value) will fall below the
limit with a given probability (e.g. 5% or 1%)?
The number (limit) sets the loss which is the value at risk.
VaR at the 95% confidence level is such a number that probability of loss
lower than VaR is 95%.
VaR can be easily found with the use of the GoalSeek tool. The demanded
probability of 5% corresponds to the return of - 8%. In this case,the limit price
is 52.51. Buying at 57 and selling at 52.51, we incur a loss of 4.49.
Should the confidence level be 99%, VaR is:
107
It means that with the probability of 1% the price of the asset will fall below
44.73, and the loss will be lower than 12.27 (with 99% chance).
ExPEriments with the use of spreadsheets are easier if the inversed normal
distribution function is used:
NORMSINV(p)
It calculates the value of x at a given probability:
and then the border value of the asset, and finally VaR:
.
where V(0) is the initial value of the asset.
The numbers in the formulae below correspond to 95% and 99% confidence
levels.
In many cases (such as share prices or exchange rates, where Black-Scholes
model can be used) VaR calculations are fairly simple. Suppose the underlying
asset is a currency, and a company is worried that the exchange rate may fall
below certain level. At the current exchange rate of S(0), the VaR relevant exchange rate at time tis:
where a is the difference between interest rate for the two involved currencies
(PLN and EUR).
VaR, simple as it is, has also its disadvantages. One needs to know and
assume a certain distribution function. Another disadvantage is related to
portfolios and risk diversification. It turns out that it is possible to find two
instruments such that the risk of the portfolio (composed of the two) is higher than the risk of individual instruments. It contradicts the common sense
and the idea of diversification. Luckily, such examples are quite rare.
108
3.2. Risk management in a company
3.2.1. Risk in a company
Companies are exposed to a range of risk factors. Let us focus on those
whose adverse influence on the value of companies can be prevented with the
use of financial instruments.
The factors are as follows:
*
interest rate
* exchange rates
* prices of materials
* prices of our products
In certain circumstances, companies may be protected against unfavorable
changes in their product prices with the use of futures contracts. It is rare, however - the lack of availability of such futures being the main obstacle. Protection
against changes in materials prices (even in the case of crude oil prices) is also
difficult due to differences between the size of futures contracts and quantities demanded by most of companies.
Exchange rate risk is faced by both exporters and importers. The importer is
worried that the foreign currency may appreciate - the foreign goods get more
exPEnsive in the local currency, the exporter, on the contrary, finds depreciation
unattractive. As it will be shown, the relationship between net profit and the exchange rate is given by a linear function (assuming flat tax rates).
Example 31.
A company has sales of 100 000 PLN.A part of costs is incurred in dollars (10 000
USD), the rest in PLN (30 000). The company pays 30% tax. At 4 PLN/USD exchange rate the net profit of the company is 21 000 PLN.

109
By changing the exchange rate we can easily model the relationship between
net profit and the exchange rate.
Example 32.
An exporter's sales are 25 000 USD, and costs 70 000 PLN. The tax rate is 30%.
The net profit at 4 PLN/USD exchange rate is again 21 000 PLN.

21000
The linear relationship between net profits and exchange rate still can be
observed. The line, however, is much steePEr, since this time the whole sales
amount is exposed to exchange rate risk.
110
When it comes to the interest rates risk, companies are typically worried
about increasing rates which mean higher interest payments. There are cases
when companies have an excess of cash that needs to be deposited in banks or
invested in bonds. The situation is rare or temporary - in the long run a company should be able to reinvest their profits and finance its own oPErations, otherwise it contradicts the purpose of setting up the company in the fIRSt place.
An increase in interest rates triggered by inflation can affect profits only to
some extent as the change concerns both sales and costs.
A sPEcial kind of risk (gap risk) concerns mostly banks.
Example 33.
Imagine a very simple situation of a bank which accepts a deposit (100 deposited
for one year) and loans the amount for five years. For simplicity, both deposit and
loan are zero-coupon bonds.

Now suppose the interest rate goes up by 200 basis points. The future values
will not change as they are the nominal values of the bonds, but the present values do change.

The value of the assets falls much lower than the value of the liabilities (market values, not the book ones), which affects the market value of the bank. As
it can be noticed, the gap analysis focuses on the value of rate sensitive assets
and rate sensitive liabilities with different maturities being the main problem. In
practice, the banks positions are much more complicated as they are composed
of millions of such transactions. Still, the problem remains the same though it is
harder to coPE with.
3.2.2. Risk management versus value
Does risk management add value?
The simplest answer is: lower risk translates into a lower cost of capital,
hence a higher present value of cash flows.
Imagine a company that has been exposed to a given exchange rate risk for
years. Its profits naturally fluctuate reflecting the ups and downs of the core oPErations. The fluctuations may be fortified or weakened by the changes caused
by jumps in and cycles of the exchange rate. Imagine the company starts hedging the risk. An effective market should notice that and the stock of the company should be priced higher (due to the lower required rate of return implied
112
by lower risk due to hedging). Or at least, it should be easier to issue new stock,
since new shareholders may appreciate risk management strategies and accept
higher prices. The same applies to an attempt to take new loans - the terms
(size, interest rate) should now be more beneficial.
On the other hand, a lack of strategies that provide stability may have disastrous effects for a company. Companies facing bankruptcy quickly lose buyers
who are afraid of facing servicing problems. Conflicts between shareholders
and debt holders are likely to hapPEn too. Such a conflict may result in rejecting reorganization plans - shareholders may conduct aggressive policies in order to use their position, and increase the value of equity by carrying out risky
projects. Due to restrictions imposed by banks, the company may be forced to
reject good projects that are recognized as too risky by the bank.
The last argument in favor of risk management concerns tax payments.
Example 34.
There are two tax brackets: 20% tax is paid on income up to 30 000, and 30% tax is
paid on income above 30 000. Let us suppose a company exPEcts profits of 25000.
If the profits are exposed to fluctuations, they might be 10 000 or 40 000 (both with
50% probability) and then the company pays 12 000 or 2 000 in taxes (on average 7
000). If however the risk is eliminated, the company pays 5 000 in taxes. The lesson
is that a stable company pays less tax and generates more cash.
3.2.3. Risk managements tools
Let us review the instruments that can be used to manage risk - it is mostly
derivatives.
Forward contracts are agreements where one party agrees to buy a commodity (also exchange rate, interest rate) at a sPEcific price on a sPEcific future
date, and the other party agrees to sell. There are some limitations to the use of
forward contracts: fIRSt, as a matter of fact it is a credit instrument, SECond, there
is always a need to find the counterparty that would be willing to take a position opposite to ours.
Futures contracts solve the counterparty and credit rating problems, but create others: standardizing. Marking to market is a new feature of such contracts
- deposit and then money to be put up to cover losses.
113
Options are sophisticated derivatives, whose feature is that call or put
premium has to be paid when purchasing options. If the option is unexercised, it is money down the drain, as some managers may say. They
ignore the fact that buying an option (esPEcially put) can be compared
to buying a car insurance policy - nobody complains if the car is stolen.
Still, options are highly leveraged and a small miscalculation may lead
to huge losses.
3.3. Case study - hedging exchange rate risk exposure
Look at the example below. It deals with the exposure to exchange rate risk.
The three questions that will be asked and answered are:
1. What are the sources of risk?
2. How to measure risk?
3. How to hedge the exposure to risk?
HL company exports its products (from England) to the USA. It needs to invest 5
million pounds in order to launch a new line of products. The sales are predicted
to generate 8 million USD at the end of the year, the costs being 3 million GBP PEr
year. The interest rates are 8% and 11% in the USA and UK resPEctively (continuous compounding is assumed). The USD/GBP spot is 1.6. Logarithmic returns are
normally distributed with 15% standard deviation. The company pays 20% effective
income tax.
It must be added that the company should be able to achieve a profit of 1.25 million
pounds a year to satisFY the exPEctations of the investors with regard to the required
rate of return (25%) and pay the dividends. Any lower profit will be regarded as a
loss.
We assume that USD/GBP exchange rate is the only source of risk. The risk
is going to be measured by VaR. The risk exposure will try to be lowered with
the use of OTC (over the counter) forward contracts and options.
Let us consider a few cases.
1. The currency position remains unhedged.
DePEnding on the exchange rate S(1), the result (after the dividend)
changes drastically (from 350 000 to -450 000). Obviously, the exchange
rates of 1.8 or 2.0 are hardly acceptable for the company. What is the value of the exchange rate S(1) at which the company breaks even?

Let us explore the issue a bit further. Here is the model of how future values
of USD/GBP can be forecasted. The model is based on the uncovered interest
rate parity, and it also fulfills the assumptions of Black-Scholes model:
where N has the standard normal distribution. With probability of 95%, N will
not exceed 1.6449, which corresponds to an exchange rate S(1)= 1.9649.
NORMSINV(95%) = 1.64485.
This is the VaR exchange rate (at 95% confidence level). In other words,
there is 5% chance that the USD/GBP exchange rate in one year will be equal
to or higher than 1.964979. If this is the spot rate that will materialize in one
year, then the income statement for the company looks as follows:

Result
-392968
VaR = 392 968 dollars and hedging seems a necessity. The question is how
to manage the risk exposure.
2. Forward contract.
We can also try to hedge with forward contracts. The forward exchange
rate is 1.5527 (formula below). The assumption is that all the 5 million
from sales will be exchanged at the rate:
Seemingly, the income statement now looks good (the gain is 471 818). The
problem is however that we are locked into the 1.5527 exchange rate. If the spot
rate is more favorable, we are still forced to use the one from the forward contract. Hedging with options leaves much more flexibility.

3. Full hedge with Options.
Let us begin with call options so the exchange rate is capPEd at a certain
level. Suppose EuroPEan call options with the following characteristics
are available: strike =1.6, call premium = 0.066902, and a maturity of 1
year. Then the cost of buying options is 334 510 dollars (209 069 pounds),
plus the interest (16%) paid on the money that is borrowed, which is 53
116
522 dollars (33 451 pounds). The options will be exercised if the spot at
the end of the year is higher than 1.6. Let us see what hapPEns if the most
PEssimistic scenario occurs, and the 1.964979 spot rate materializes. The
income statement looks much better (compared to the unhedged version)
as VaR was negative (it means the gain of 114 170).

If the exchange rate drops to 1.5, the option will not be exercised. The strategy then leads to a positive result of 380 837 pounds.
4. Partial hedge with options
When hedging with options, one incurs a cost of paying the option premium. Let us try to reduce the cost by hedging only a fraction (50%) of
the exposure. Assuming the same characteristics of the option, only 4
million dollars will be exchanged into pounds at the strike price of 1.6,
the rest at 1.965.

5. There are more combinations possible, one of them being for example
combining options and forward contracts. The outcome is shown below,
where we summarize the resulting VaR for all strategies considered (the
results below are equal to minus VaR):

The values are computed at a 95% confidence level, corresponding to the exchange rate of USD/GBP 1.9887.
We hedged with options (line 3), used delta hedging and covered only 50%
of the exposure (line 4), used forward contracts (line 2), combined options and
forward (line 5), and last but not least did nothing (line 1). The figure below
shows the outcomes as a function of the exchange rate S(1) for each of the strategies.
The strategy using a forward contract apPEars to be the safest one, but leaves
no flexibility. Those believing that the pound will weaken may remain unhedged. A variety of middle-of-the ROAd strategies are also available. The final
choice should dePEnd on the VaR amount itself. If, say, losing 392 968 (strategy
1) puts the whole company in jeopardy, then we definitely should hedge. Basically, derivatives in commercial use should be used with the aim of protecting
companies, not for sPEculation.
Conclusions
This book, for a few different reasons, was focused on the DCF method, the
main of the reasons being that the DCF method captures best the value of profitable, economically sound companies - it works for all firms which have real
exPErtise. The main purpose of this book was to explain the inner workings of
the DCF method, esPEcially the variant in which capital structure constantly affects cost of equity, as it does in reality.
The focus then was on the valuation model which integrates the three components that elsewhere are often treated separately: cash flows, the cost of capital and the discounting process itself. The book revolved around these three issues. For example, it is commonly known that if the value of equity changes,
the capital structure changes too. At the same time the change may affect the
cost of capital, which in turn will influence the value of equity itself. The recursive appROAch to company valuation that was presented in the book relied
on solving such logical loops that apPEared both at each time PEriod and along
time PEriods. PErforming the company valuation is such a way is much more
complicated than assuming no links between for example the value of equity
and the cost of capital, but leads to a much more reliable and methodically flawless valuation.
