5-8 PART 2 Business Analysis and Valuation Tools
Continuing on an As Reported basis, Nordstrom is able to create shareholder value
through its financing strategy. In 2010, the spread between Nordstrom's oPErating ROA
and its after-tax interest cost was 16.1 PErcent, and its net financial leverage (net debt as
a PErcentage of equity) was 116 PErcent. These factors combined to contribute a financial
leverage gain of 18.6 PErcent in 2010, which is the incremental difference between
Nordstrom's oPErating ROA of 20.4 PErcent and its ROE of 39.0 PErcent.
TJX, on the other hand, while it had a 73.1 PErcent spread between oPErating ROA
and its after-tax interest cost (which actually calculates at a negative rate due to its negative net debt position; that is, the company had more cash than debt), had a negative
financial leverage gain resulting from that negative net debt position. As a result, its
oPErating ROA at 70.6 PErcent is actually higher than its ROE of 46.5 PErcent in 2010.
Remembering once more TJX's use of off-balance sheet financing for its stores (which
results in TJX having artificially low reported financial leverage) will help the analyst
understand the impact of that decision on the financing component of its ROE.
As noted above, TJX shows an adjusted ROE of 55.4 PErcent--a significant increase over
its As Reported ROE of 46.5 PErcent, and well above Nordstrom's As Adjusted ROE of
40.0 PErcent (Nordstrom as a whole generally sees minor impact from the oPErating lease
adjustment given its more limited use of oPErating leases). The impact of the oPErating
lease adjustment can be seen most strongly in net oPErating asset turnover for TJX, which
falls from 11.33 to 3.44 due to the greatly increased asset base, bringing oPErating ROA
down from 70.6 PErcent to 27.8 PErcent. This in turn reduces the spread between TJX's oPErating ROA and after tax interest cost from 73.1 PErcent to 22.8 PErcent. Even so, the change
in net financial leverage from -0.33 on an As Reported basis to 1.21 on an As Adjusted basis
creates a positive financial leverage gain of 27.6 PErcent, as compared to a -24.1 PErcent
gain on an As Reported basis. What this says is that TJX's use of additional leverage (as simulated with the adjustments made for the oPErating leases) has actually helPEd--through an
increase in net oPErating profit margin, but primarily by reversing a negative financial leverage gain, to create additional shareholder return as seen in the higher As Adjusted ROE.
The appropriate benchmark for evaluating oPErating ROA is the weighted average cost of
debt and equity capital, or WACC. In the long run, the value of a firm's assets is determined
by how its oPErating ROA compares to this norm. Moreover, over the long run and ABSent
some barrier to comPEtitive forces, oPErating ROA will tend to be pushed toward the
weighted average cost of capital. Since the WACC is typically lower than the cost of equity
capital, oPErating ROA over time tends to be pushed to a level lower than that to which ROE
tends. We will discuss further the use and calculation of the WACC in Chapter 8.
The average oPErating ROA for public firms in the United States in the twenty-year
PEriod 1991-2010 was 9 PErcent.8 In 2010 both TJX and Nordstrom significantly
exceeded this benchmark. The impressive oPErating PErformance of both firms would
have been obscured by using the simple ROA measure.9
Assessing OPErating Management: Decomposing
Net Profit Margins
A firm's net profit margin, or return on sales (ROS), shows the profitability of the company's oPErating activities. Further decomposition of a firm's ROS allows an analyst to
assess the efficiency of the firm's oPErating management. A popular tool used in this
analysis is the common-sized income statement in which all the line items are expressed
as a PErcentage of sales revenues.
Common-sized income statements make it possible to compare trends in income statement relationships over time for the firm and trends across different firms in the industry.
To illustrate how the income statement analysis can be used, common-sized income

statements for TJX and Nordstrom are shown in Table 5-5. The table also shows some
commonly used profitability ratios. We will use the information in Table 5-5 to investigate
the drivers behind TJX and Nordstrom's net income margins (ROS) in 2010.
In this SECtion we focus primarily on an analysis of As Reported numbers. As can be
seen in Table 5-5, the oPErating lease adjustment results in revised As Adjusted numbers
for both companies, with TJX showing the larger change due to its greater use of oPErating leases. The impact of the adjustment is straightforward on the income statement, in
that both companies show an increase in profitability metrics (gross profit, EBITDA,
NOPAT, and ROS) due to a lower cost of goods sold (due to the depreciation component of COGS being only a portion of the previously utilized lease exPEnse), and show
increased interest exPEnse (due to the added debt component) and tax exPEnse (due to
higher net income). We will point out a few of the more interesting results of the adjustment where warranted.
Gross Profit Margins
The difference between a firm's sales and cost of sales is gross profit. Gross profit margin
is an indication of the extent to which revenues exceed direct costs associated with sales,
and it is computed as
Gross profit margin 1/4 Sales (cid:3) Cost of sales
Gross margin is influenced by two factors: (1) the price premium that a firm's
products or services command in the marketplace and (2) the efficiency of the firm's
Sales
5-10 PART 2 Business Analysis and Valuation Tools
procurement and production process. The price premium a firm's products or services
can command is influenced by the degree of comPEtition and the extent to which its
products are unique. The firm's cost of sales can be low when it can purchase its inputs
at a lower cost than comPEtitors and/or run its production processes more efficiently.
This is generally the case when a firm has a low-cost strategy.
Table 5-5 indicates that consistent with Nordstrom's premium price strategy, its gross
margin on an As Reported basis of 42.6 PErcent in 2010 was significantly higher than
that of TJX.
Selling, General, and Administrative ExPEnses
A company's selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) exPEnses are influenced by the
oPErating activities it has to undertake to implement its comPEtitive strategy. As discussed in Chapter 2, firms with differentiation strategies have to undertake activities to
achieve that differentiation. A company comPEting on the basis of quality and rapid
introduction of new products is likely to have higher R&D costs relative to a company
comPEting purely on a cost basis. Similarly, a company that attempts to build a brand
image, distribute its products through full-service retailers, and provide significant customer service is likely to have higher selling and administration costs relative to a company that sells through warehouse retailers or direct mail and does not provide much
customer support.
A company's SG&A exPEnses are also influenced by the efficiency with which it manages its overhead activities. The control of oPErating exPEnses is likely to be esPEcially
important for firms comPEting on the basis of low cost. However, even for differentiators, it is important to assess whether the cost of differentiation is commensurate with
the price premium earned in the marketplace.
Several ratios in Table 5-5 allow us to evaluate the effectiveness with which TJX
and Nordstrom manage their SG&A exPEnses. FIRSt, the ratio of SG&A exPEnse to
sales shows how much a company is sPEnding to generate each sales dollar. We see
that TJX has a significantly lower ratio of SG&A to sales than does Nordstrom. This
should not be surprising given that TJX pursues a low-cost strategy whereas Nordstrom pursues an intensively customer-service-focused strategy. Given that TJX and
Nordstrom are pursuing radically different pricing, merchandising, and service strategies, it is not surprising that they have very different cost structures: TJX's lower
gross margins and lower SG&A to sales are reflective of its low cost strategy, while
Nordstrom's higher margins and also higher SG&A exPEnses reflect its focus on
providing a high service, differentiated offering to more affluent customers. A key
question is, when both these costs are netted out, which company PErformed better?
Two ratios provide useful signals here: net oPErating profit margin (NOPAT margin)
and EBITDA margin:
NOPAT margin 1/4 NOPAT
Sales
EBITDA margin 1/4 Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization
Sales
NOPAT margin provides a comprehensive indication of the oPErating PErformance
of a company because it reflects all oPErating costs and eliminates the effects of debt
policy. EBITDA margin provides similar information, except that it excludes depreciation and amortization exPEnse, a significant non-cash oPErating exPEnse. Some analysts
prefer to use EBITDA margin because they believe that it focuses on "cash" oPErating
Financial Analysis 5-11
items. While this is to some extent true, it can be potentially misleading for two reasons. EBITDA is not a strictly cash concept because sales, cost of sales, and SG&A
exPEnses often include non-cash items. Also, depreciation is a real oPErating exPEnse,
and it reflects to some extent the consumption of resources. Therefore, ignoring it can
be misleading.
Table 5-5 shows that TJX was able to earn 6.2 cents in oPErating profits out of every
dollar of sales it generated, whereas Nordstrom earned 7.1 cents PEr sales dollar. It is
interesting to note that on an As Adjusted basis TJX actually earns a higher oPErating
profit to sales than Nordstrom.
Recall that in Table 5-3 we define NOPAT as net income plus net interest exPEnse
after tax. Therefore, NOPAT is influenced by any unusual or non-oPErating income
(exPEnse) items included in net income. We can calculate a "recurring" NOPAT
margin by eliminating these items. Nordstrom's recurring and traditional NOPAT
margins are the same, indicating no unusual or non-oPErating income or exPEnse
items impacting net income in 2010. For TJX as well the major portion of its profits
came from its core business. TJX's recurring NOPAT margin is slightly lower than its
traditional NOPAT margin in 2010 (6.19 PErcent compared to 6.23 PErcent) due to
the small gain on discontinued oPErations in 2010 (mentioned at the beginning of
the chapter) related to the reduction of a reserve related to settling lease-related obligations of former businesses.10 While in this particular example there was only a
minor difference between recurring and traditional NOPAT margin, in general, recurring NOPAT may be a better benchmark to use when extrapolating current PErformance into the future since it reflects margins from the core business activities of a
firm, esPEcially if in the particular years analyzed the firm generated significant
income from non-core or discontinued oPErations. The alternate appROAch that we
take, of course, is to adjust the financials to remove this non-recurring item entirely
as we do in As Adjusted numbers.
Nordstrom also has a better EBITDA margin than TJX on an As Reported basis,
although the difference narrows when comparing As Adjusted numbers, since on an As
Reported basis TJX's use of oPErating leases results in much higher leasing exPEnse,
which is included in EBITDA, while Nordstrom's higher depreciation exPEnse resulting
from its store ownership strategy is excluded.
Tax ExPEnse
Taxes are an important element of a firm's total exPEnses. Through a wide variety of tax
planning techniques, firms can attempt to reduce their tax exPEnses.11 There are two
measures one can use to evaluate a firm's tax exPEnse. One is the ratio of tax exPEnse
to sales, and the other is the ratio of tax exPEnse to earnings before taxes (also known
as the average tax rate). The firm's tax footnote provides a detailed account of why its
average tax rate differs from the statutory tax rate.
Table 5-5 shows that Nordstrom had a slightly higher income tax exPEnse as a
PErcent of sales than TJX. Given that the two companies had the same average tax
rate in 2010 at 38 PErcent, this difference can be attributed to Nordstrom's higher
pretax profits as a PErcent of sales, although the situation is reversed on an As
Adjusted basis.
In summary, an examination of common-sized income statement ratios can illuminate strategic and oPErational differences among comPEtitors. While Nordstrom's positioning as a high-end retailer allows it to earn a larger gross margin on sales than TJX,
it is a tight control over exPEnses that helps TJX to comPEnsate for its lower gross margin and to ultimately earn a similar net income margin.
5-12 PART 2 Business Analysis and Valuation Tools
Key Analysis Questions
A number of business questions will be useful to an analyst assessing the various
elements of oPErating management:
Are the company's margins consistent with its stated comPEtitive strategy? For
example, a differentiation strategy should usually lead to higher gross margins
than a low-cost strategy.
Are the company's margins changing? Why? What are the underlying business
causes--changes in comPEtition, changes in input costs, or poor overhead cost
management?
Is the company managing its overhead and administrative costs well? What are
the business activities driving these costs? Are these activities necessary?
Are the company's tax policies sustainable, or is the current tax rate influenced
by one-time tax credits?
Do the firm's tax planning strategies lead to other business costs? For example,
if the oPErations are located in tax havens, how does this affect the company's
profit margins and asset utilization? Are the benefits of tax planning strategies
(reduced taxes) greater than the increased business costs?
Evaluating Investment Management: Decomposing Asset Turnover
Asset turnover is the SECond driver of a company's return on equity. Since firms invest
considerable resources in their assets, using them productively is critical to overall profitability. A detailed analysis of asset turnover allows the analyst to evaluate the effectiveness of a firm's investment management. There are two primary areas of investment
management: (1) working capital management and (2) management of long-term assets,
both of which are discussed in further detail below.
Working Capital Management
is defined as the difference between a firm's current assets and
Working capital
current liabilities. However, this definition does not distinguish between oPErating
components (such as accounts receivable,
inventory, and accounts payable) and
financing components (such as cash, marketable SECurities, and notes payable). An
alternative measure that makes this distinction is oPErating working capital, defined
in Table 5-3 as
OPErating working capital 1/4 dCurrent assets (cid:3) cash and marketable SECuritiesTh
(cid:3) dCurrent liabilities (cid:3) Short-term and current portion of long-term debtTh
The components of oPErating working capital that analysts primarily focus on are
accounts receivable, inventory, and accounts payable. A certain amount of investment
in working capital is generally necessary for the firm to run its normal oPErations. For
example, a firm's credit policies and distribution policies determine its optimal level of
accounts receivable. The nature of the production process and the need for buffer stocks
determine the optimal level of inventory. Finally, accounts payable is a routine source of
financing for the firm's working capital, and payment practices in an industry determine
the normal level of accounts payable.
The following ratios are useful in analyzing a firm's working capital management:
oPErating working capital as a PErcent of sales, oPErating working capital turnover,
accounts receivable turnover, inventory turnover, and accounts payable turnover. The
Financial Analysis 5-13
turnover ratios can also be expressed in number of days of activity that the oPErating
working capital (and its components) can support. These ratios are defined below:
OPErating working capital to sales ratio 1/4 OPErating working capital
Sales
OPErating working capital turnover 1/4

Accounts receivable turnover 1/4

Average sales PEr day
Days' inventory 1/4

Average cost of goods sold PEr day
Days' payables 1/4
Accounts payable
Average purchases dor cost of goods soldTh PEr day
OPErating working capital turnover indicates how many dollars of sales a firm is able
to generate for each dollar invested in oPErating working capital. Accounts receivable
turnover, inventory turnover, and accounts payable turnover allow the analyst to examine how productively the three principal components of working capital are being used.
Days' receivables, days' inventory, and days' payables are another way to evaluate the
efficiency of a firm's working capital management.13
Long-Term Assets Management
Another area of investment management concerns the utilization of a firm's long-term
assets. It is useful to define again a firm's investment in long-term assets:
Net long-term assets 1/4 dTotal long-term assets
(cid:3) Non-interest-bearing long-term liabilitiesTh
Long-term assets generally consist of net proPErty, plant, and equipment (PP&E), intangible
assets such as goodwill, and other assets. Non-interest-bearing long-term liabilities include
items such as deferred taxes. We define net long-term assets and net working capital in such
a way that their sum, net oPErating assets, is equal to the sum of net debt and equity, or net
capital. This is consistent with the way we defined oPErating ROA earlier in the chapter.
The efficiency with which a firm uses its net long-term assets is measured by the
following two ratios: net long-term assets as a PErcent of sales and net long-term asset
turnover, defined as
Net long-term asset turnover 1/4
Sales
Net long-term assets
5-14 PART 2 Business Analysis and Valuation Tools
ProPErty plant and equipment (PP&E) is the most important long-term asset in a
firm's balance sheet. The efficiency with which a firm's PP&E is used is measured either
by the ratio of PP&E to sales or by the PP&E turnover ratio:
PP&E turnover 1/4
Sales
Net proPErty, plant, and equipment
Key Analysis Questions
The ratios discussed in the two preceding SECtions allow the analyst to explore a
number of business questions:
How well does the company manage its inventory? Does the company use modern manufacturing techniques? Does it have good vendor and logistics management systems? If inventory ratios are changing, what is the underlying business
reason? Are new products being planned? Is there a mismatch between the
demand forecasts and actual sales?
How well does the company manage its credit policies? Are these policies consistent with its marketing strategy? Is the company artificially increasing sales by
loading the distribution channels?
Is the company taking advantage of trade credit? Is it relying too much on trade
credit? If so, what are the implicit costs?
Is the company's investment in plant and equipment consistent with its comPEtitive strategy? Does the company have a sound policy of acquisitions and
divestitures?
Table 5-6 shows the asset turnover ratios for TJX and Nordstrom on an As Reported
and As Adjusted basis. The major impact of the oPErating lease adjustment comes in
long-term asset ratios, with small SECondary impacts in the ratios that use cost of goods
sold. Due to the narrow impact of the oPErating lease adjustment in this SECtion, we will
focus here on an analysis of As Reported numbers and quickly summarize the key
changes due to the adjustments at the end of the SECtion.
TJX is extremely efficient at managing its working capital needs, with oPErating
working capital representing less than 1 PErcent of total sales in 2010. Tight inventory management, a slightly slow payment policy (seen in a 35.3 days payable), low
short-term debt, and the small accounts receivable balance (reflective of TJX's decision to outsource its branded credit card) contribute to TJX's low oPErating working
capital levels.
Nordstrom is using its vendors to provide oPErating working capital even more
effectively (and is more willing PErhaps to stretch out payments to vendors) than TJX
with days accounts payable in 2010 of 47.6. The primary driver of Nordstrom's much
higher ratio of oPErating working capital to sales (and thus lower oPErating working
capital turnover) of 16.5 PErcent in 2010 (as compared to 0.76 PErcent for TJX) is its
large accounts receivable balance that results from its previously discussed strategy of
financing its customers through its in-house credit card oPErations (which results in a
lengthy days accounts receivable of 76.6 in 2010 compared to 2.5 for TJX). Nordstrom
is quite efficient in managing its inventory with inventory turnover of 6.2 times in
2010, the same as TJX. This is interesting in that intuitively, one would exPEct that
TJX (as a company pursuing a low-cost, efficient supply chain strategy) would be

much more successful at efficient inventory management than a company such as
Nordstrom, which prides itself on a bROAd and differentiated selection. The ratios
show that Nordstrom apPEars to achieve both a bROAd selection and efficient inventory
management at the same time.
TJX shows significantly better net long-term asset and PP&E utilization than Nordstrom as seen in its higher net long-term asset and PP&E turnover ratios. This is reflective of the difference in store financing strategies discussed previously. When this
difference is adjusted for, these ratios are much more comparable, as seen in the comparison of As Adjusted numbers for net long-terms assets/sales, PP&E/sales, net long-term
asset turnover, and PP&E turnover (which are just the inverse of the fIRSt two ratios).
There are small differences between As Reported and As Adjusted figures for inventory
turnover and accounts payable turnover and their inverse days' inventory and days'
accounts payable, but these differences are minor and can be attributed to the adjustment made to cost of goods sold.
Evaluating Financial Management: Analyzing Financial Leverage
Financial leverage enables a firm to have an asset base larger than its equity. The firm
can augment its equity through borrowing and the creation of other liabilities such as
accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and deferred taxes. Financial leverage increases a
firm's ROE as long as the cost of the liabilities is less than the return from investing
these funds. In this resPEct, it is important to distinguish between interest-bearing liabilities such as notes payable, other forms of short-term and long-term debt that carry an
explicit interest charge, and other liabilities. Some of these other forms of liability, such
as accounts payable or deferred taxes, do not carry any interest charge at all. Others,
lease obligations and PEnsion obligations, carry an implicit interest
such as capital
charge. Finally, some firms carry large cash balances or investments in marketable SECurities. These balances reduce a firm's net debt because conceptually the firm can pay
down its debt using its cash and short-term investments.
5-16 PART 2 Business Analysis and Valuation Tools
While financial
leverage can potentially benefit a firm's shareholders,
it can also
increase their risk. Unlike equity, liabilities have predefined payment terms, and the
firm faces risk of financial distress if it fails to meet these commitments. There are a
number of ratios to evaluate the degree of risk arising from a firm's financial leverage.
Current Liabilities and Short-Term Liquidity
The following ratios are useful in evaluating the risk related to a firm's current liabilities:
Current ratio 1/4 Current assets
Current liabilities
Quick ratio 1/4 Cash th Short-term investments th Accounts receivable
Current liabilities
Cash ratio 1/4 Cash th Marketable SECurities
Current liabilities
OPErating cash flow ratio 1/4 Cash flow from oPErations
Current liabilities
All the above ratios attempt to measure the firm's ability to repay its current liabilities. The fIRSt three compare a firm's current liabilities with its short-term assets that
can be used to repay those liabilities. The fourth ratio focuses on the ability of the
firm's oPErations to generate the resources needed to repay its current liabilities.
Since both current assets and current liabilities have comparable duration, the current ratio is a key index of a firm's short-term liquidity. Analysts view a current ratio
of more than one to be an indication that the firm can cover its current liabilities
from the cash realized from its current assets. However, the firm can face a shortterm liquidity problem even with a current ratio exceeding one when some of its
current assets are not easy to liquidate. Quick ratio and cash ratio capture the firm's
ability to cover its current liabilities from liquid assets. Quick ratio assumes that the
firm's accounts receivable are liquid. This is true in industries where the creditworthiness of the customers is beyond dispute, or when receivables are collected in a
very short PEriod. When these conditions do not prevail, cash ratio, which considers
only cash and marketable SECurities, is a better indication of a firm's ability to cover its
current liabilities in an emergency. OPErating cash flow is another measure of the firm's
ability to cover its current liabilities from cash generated from oPErations of the firm.
The liquidity ratios for TJX and Nordstrom are shown in Table 5-7. Nordstrom's significantly higher accounts receivable balances drive its higher current and quick ratios

relative to TJX. The cash ratios are somewhat more comparable given that accounts
receivable is not included in this calculation and both companies have a healthy cash
balance in 2010. TJX's oPErating cash flow ratio was slightly ahead of that of Nordstrom,
indicating overall stronger cash flow from oPErations relative to its current liabilities. In
general, both firms' liquidity situations are comfortable and are not likely to be a point
of concern for short-term creditors. Finally, it can be noted that the oPErating lease
adjustment had no impact on these ratios.
Debt and Long-Term Solvency
A company's financial leverage is also influenced by its debt financing policy. There are several potential benefits from debt financing. FIRSt, debt is typically cheaPEr than equity
because the firm promises predefined payment terms to debt holders. SECond, in most countries interest on debt financing is tax deductible whereas dividends to shareholders are not
tax deductible. Third, debt financing can impose discipline on the firm's management and
motivate it to reduce wasteful exPEnditures. Fourth, for non-public debt, it is likely to be
easier for management to communicate their proprietary information on the firm's strategies and prosPEcts to private lenders than to public capital markets. Such communication
can potentially reduce a firm's cost of capital. For all these reasons, it is advantageous for
firms to use at least some debt in their capital structure. Too much reliance on debt financing, however, is potentially costly to the firm's shareholders. The firm will face financial distress if it defaults on the interest and principal payments. Debt holders also impose
covenants on the firm, restricting the firm's oPErating, investment, and financing decisions.
The optimal capital structure for a firm is determined primarily by its business risk. A
firm's cash flows are highly predictable when there is little comPEtition or there is little
threat of technological changes. Such firms have low business risk; hence they can rely
heavily on debt financing. In contrast, if a firm's oPErating cash flows are highly volatile
and its capital exPEnditure needs are unpredictable, it may have to rely primarily on
equity financing. Managers' attitudes toward risk and financial flexibility also often
determine a firm's debt policies.
There are a number of ratios that help the analyst in this area. To evaluate the mix of
debt and equity in a firm's capital structure, the following ratios are useful:
Liabilities to equity ratio 1/4 Total liabilities
Shareholders' equity
Debt-to-equity ratio 1/4 Short-term debt th Long-term debt
Shareholders' equity
Net-debt-to-equity ratio

5-18 PART 2 Business Analysis and Valuation Tools
The fIRSt ratio reformulates one of the three primary ratios underlying ROE, the
assets-to-equity ratio (it is the assets-to-equity ratio minus one). The SECond ratio provides an indication of how many dollars of debt financing the firm is using for each dollar invested by its shareholders. The third ratio uses net debt, which is total debt minus
cash and marketable SECurities, as the measure of a firm's borrowings. The fourth and
fifth ratios measure debt as a proportion of total capital. In calculating all the above
ratios, it is important to include all interest-bearing obligations, whether the interest
charge is explicit or implicit. Recall that examples of line items that carry an implicit
interest charge include capital lease obligations and PEnsion obligations.
Analysts sometimes include any potential off-balance-sheet obligations that a firm
may have, such as non-cancellable oPErating leases, in the definition of a firm's debt.
We show that (as previously described) in the As Adjusted numbers in our TJX and
Nordstrom example.
The ease with which a firm can meet its interest payments is an indication of the
degree of risk associated with its debt policy. The interest coverage ratio provides a measure of this construct:
Interest coverage dearnings basisTh 1/4 Net income th Interest exPEnse th Tax exPEnse
Interest exPEnse
Interest coverage dcash flow basisTh
1/4 Cash flow from oPErations th Interest exPEnse th Taxes paid
Interest exPEnse
The earnings-based coverage ratio indicates the dollars of earnings available for each
dollar of required interest payment; the cash-flow-based coverage ratio indicates the dollars of cash generated by oPErations for each dollar of required interest payment. In both
these ratios, the denominator is the interest exPEnse. In the numerator we add taxes back
because taxes are computed only after interest exPEnse is deducted. A coverage ratio of
one implies that the firm is barely covering its interest exPEnse through its oPErating
activities, which is a very risky situation. The larger the coverage ratio, the greater the
cushion the firm has to meet interest obligations.
Key Analysis Questions
Some of the business questions to ask when the analyst is examining a firm's debt
policies follow:
Does the company have enough debt? Is it exploiting the potential benefits of
debt--interest tax shields, management discipline, and easier communication?
Does the company have too much debt given its business risk? What tyPE of
debt covenant restrictions does the firm face? Is it bearing the costs of too
much debt, risking potential financial distress and reduced business flexibility?
What is the company doing with the borrowed funds? Investing in working capital? Investing in fixed assets? Are these investments profitable?
Is the company borrowing money to pay dividends? If so, what
justification?
is the
We show debt and coverage ratios for TJX and Nordstrom in Table 5-8. On an As
Reported basis, TJX carries a much lower debt load than Nordstrom, which is reflected

in the As Reported debt ratios shown in Table 5-8. As discussed, this makes sense given
that Nordstrom finances its ownership of a large proportion of its stores with long-term
debt, while TJX avoids this debt with the use of oPErating leases. In addition, TJX shows
extraordinarily high interest coverage ratios, but this picture changes when one again
considers TJX's store leasing strategy. When both companies are adjusted for the impact
of their oPErating lease usage, the debt ratios align much more closely, as seen in the As
Adjusted ratios in Table 5-8.
If the present value of minimum lease rental obligations is added to TJX's net debt, its
net debt to equity ratio increases dramatically--which can be seen in the As Adjusted net
debt to equity. The impact of the oPErating lease adjustment is similar but of much less
magnitude for Nordstrom given its more limited use of oPErating leases. Also, notice
how the additional interest exPEnse added as part of the oPErating lease adjustment
brings the interest coverage ratios of the companies much closer together (seen in As
Adjusted interest coverage). These items illustrate the importance of considering offbalance sheet obligations in analyzing a company's financial management. In general,
both companies are in a relatively comfortable situation relative to their fixed obligations,
even after factoring in oPErating lease commitments.
Ratios of Disaggregated Data
So far we have discussed how to compute ratios using information in the financial
statements. Analysts often probe the above ratios further by using disaggregated financial and physical data. For example, for a multibusiness company, one could analyze
the information by individual business segments. Such an analysis can reveal potential
differences in the PErformance of each business unit, allowing the analyst to pinpoint
areas where a company's strategy is working and where it is not. It is also possible to
probe financial ratios further by computing ratios of physical data PErtaining to a company's oPErations. The appropriate physical data to look at varies from industry to
industry. As an example in retailing, one could compute productivity statistics such as
sales PEr store, sales PEr square foot, customer transactions PEr store, and average
amount of sale PEr customer transaction. In the hotel industry, room occupancy rates
provide important information; in the cellular telephone industry, acquisition cost PEr
new subscriber and subscriber retention rate are important. These disaggregated ratios
are particularly useful for young firms and young industries such as Internet firms,
where accounting data may not fully capture the business economics due to conservative accounting rules.

Putting It All Together: Assessing Sustainable Growth Rate
Analysts often use the concept of sustainable growth as a way to evaluate a firm's ratios
in a comprehensive manner. A firm's sustainable growth rate is defined as
Sustainable growth rate 1/4 ROE (cid:2) d1 (cid:3) Dividend payout ratioTh
We already discussed the analysis of ROE in the previous four SECtions. The dividend
payout ratio is defined as
Divided payout ratio 1/4 Cash dividends paid
Net income
A firm's dividend payout ratio is a measure of its dividend policy. Firms pay dividends
for several reasons. They provide a way to return to shareholders any cash generated in
excess of the firm's oPErating and investment needs. When there are information asymmetries between a firm's managers and its shareholders, dividend payments can serve as
a signal to shareholders about managers' exPEctations of the firm's future prosPEcts.
Firms may also pay dividends to attract a certain tyPE of shareholder base.
Sustainable growth rate is the rate at which a firm can grow while keeping its profitability and financial policies unchanged. A firm's return on equity and its dividend
payout policy determine the pool of funds available for growth. Of course the firm can
grow at a rate different from its sustainable growth rate if its profitability, payout policy,
or financial leverage changes. Therefore, the sustainable growth rate provides a benchmark against which a firm's growth plans can be evaluated. Figure 5-2 shows how a
firm's sustainable growth rate can be linked to all the ratios discussed in this chapter.

Financial Analysis 5-21
These linkages allow an analyst to examine the drivers of a firm's current sustainable
growth rate. If the firm intends to grow at a higher rate than its sustainable growth
rate, one could assess which of the ratios are likely to change in the process.
Key Analysis Questions
Analysis of sustainable growth can lead to asking the following tyPEs of business
questions:
How quickly can the firm grow its business by keeping its profitability and
financial policies unchanged?
If it intends growing faster, where is the growth going to come from? Is management exPEcting profitability to increase? Or asset productivity to improve?
Are these exPEctations realistic? Is the firm planning for these changes?
If the firm is planning to increase its financial leverage or cut dividends, what is
the likely impact of these financial policy changes?
Table 5-9 shows the sustainable growth rate and its components for TJX and Nordstrom. TJX had a significantly higher sustainable growth rate relative to Nordstrom on
both an As Reported and As Adjusted basis, due to both its higher ROEs and a lower
dividend payout ratio. TJX's actual sales, asset, and liability growth rates in 2010 were
considerably lower than implied by its sustainable growth rate, reflecting management's
balanced appROAch to growth, investment, and returning funds to shareholders in the
form of dividends and stock repurchase.
Historical Patterns of Ratios for U.S. Firms
To provide a benchmark for analysis, Table 5-10 reports historical values of the key ratios
discussed in this chapter. These ratios are calculated using financial statement data for all
publicly listed U.S. companies. The table shows the values of ROE, its key components, and
the sustainable growth rate for each of the years 1991 to 2010, and the average for this twenty
year PEriod. The data show that the average ROE over this time frame has been 10.3 PErcent,
average oPErating ROA has been 9.0 PErcent, and the average spread between oPErating
ROA and net borrowing costs after tax has been 2.5 PErcent. The average sustainable growth
rate for U.S. companies during this PEriod has been 4.9 PErcent. Of course, an individual
company's ratios might depart from these economy-wide averages for a number of reasons,
such as industry effects, company strategies, and management effectiveness. Nonetheless, the
average values in the table serve as useful benchmarks in financial analysis.

CASH FLOW ANALYSIS
The ratio analysis discussion focused on analyzing a firm's income statement (net profit
margin analysis) or its balance sheet (asset turnover and financial leverage). The analyst
can get further insights into the firm's oPErating, investing, and financing policies by
examining its cash flows. Cash flow analysis also provides an indication of the quality
of the information in the firm's income statement and balance sheet. As before, we will
illustrate the concepts discussed in this SECtion using TJX's and Nordstrom's cash flows.
Cash Flow and Funds Flow Statements
All U.S. companies are required to include a statement of cash flows in their financial
statements under Statement of Financial Accounts Standard No. 95 (SFAS 95). In the
cash flow statement, firms report their cash flows in three categories: cash flow from
oPErations, cash flow related to investments, and cash flow related to financing activities. Cash flow from oPErations is the cash generated by the firm from the sale of goods
and services after paying for the cost of inputs and oPErations. Cash flow related to
intercorporate
investment activities shows the cash paid for capital exPEnditures,
long-term assets.
investments, acquisitions, and cash received from the sales of
Financial Analysis 5-23
Cash flow related to financing activities shows the cash raised from (or paid to) the
firm's stockholders and debt holders.
Firms use two cash flow statement formats: the direct format and the indirect format.
The key difference between the two formats is the way they report cash flow from oPErating activities. In the direct cash flow format, which is used by only a small number of
firms, oPErating cash receipts and disbursements are reported directly. In the indirect
format, firms derive their oPErating cash flows by making adjustments to net income.
Because the indirect format links the cash flow statement with the firm's income statement and balance sheet, many analysts and managers find this format more useful. As a
result, the FASB requires firms using the direct format to report oPErating cash flows in
the indirect format as well.
Recall from Chapter 3 that net income differs from oPErating cash flows because
revenues and exPEnses are measured on an accrual basis. There are two tyPEs of
accruals embedded in net income. FIRSt, there are current accruals like credit sales
and unpaid exPEnses. Current accruals result in changes in a firm's current assets
(such as accounts receivable, inventory, prepaid exPEnses) and current liabilities (such
as accounts payable and accrued liabilities). The SECond tyPE of accruals included in the
income statement is noncurrent accruals such as depreciation, deferred taxes, and
equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries. To derive cash flow from oPErations
from net income, adjustments have to be made for both these tyPEs of accruals. In
addition, adjustments must be made for nonoPErating gains included in net income
such as profits from asset sales.
Some firms outside the United States report a funds flow statement rather than a cash
flow statement of the tyPE described above. Prior to SFAS 95, U.S. firms also reported a
similar statement. Funds flow statements show working capital flows, not cash flows. It is
useful for analysts to know how to convert a funds flow statement into a cash flow
statement.
Funds flow statements typically provide information on a firm's working capital
from oPErations, defined as net income adjusted for noncurrent accruals, and gains
from the sale of long-term assets. As discussed above, cash flow from oPErations essentially involves a third adjustment, the adjustment for current accruals. Thus it is
relatively straightforward to convert working capital from oPErations to cash flow
from oPErations by making the relevant adjustments for current accruals related to
oPErations.
Information on current accruals can be obtained by examining changes in a firm's
current assets and current liabilities. Typically, oPErating accruals represent changes in
all the current asset accounts other than cash and cash equivalents, and changes in all
the current liabilities other than notes payable and the current portion of long-term
debt.14 Cash from oPErations can be calculated as follows:
Working capital from oPErations
(cid:3) Increase (or th decrease) in accounts receivable
(cid:3) Increase (or th decrease) in inventory
(cid:3) Increase (or th decrease) in other current assets excluding cash and
cash equivalents
th Increase (or (cid:3) decrease) in accounts payable
th Increase (or (cid:3) decrease) in other current liabilities excluding debt.
Funds flow statements also often do not classiFY investment and financing flows. In
such a case, the analyst has to classiFY the line items in the funds flow statement into
these two categories by evaluating the nature of the business transactions that give rise
to the flow represented by the line items.
5-24 PART 2 Business Analysis and Valuation Tools
Analyzing Cash Flow Information
Cash flow analysis can be used to address a variety of questions regarding a firm's cash
flow dynamics:
How strong is the firm's internal cash flow generation? Is the cash flow from
oPErations positive or negative? If it is negative, why? Is it because the company
is growing? Is it because its oPErations are unprofitable? Or is it having difficulty
managing its working capital proPErly?
Does the company have the ability to meet its short-term financial obligations,
such as interest payments, from its oPErating cash flow? Can it continue to meet
these obligations without reducing its oPErating flexibility?
How much cash did the company invest in growth? Are these investments consistent with its business strategy? Did the company use internal cash flow to finance
growth, or did it rely on external financing?
Did the company pay dividends from internal free cash flow, or did it have to rely
on external financing? If the company had to fund its dividends from external
sources, is the company's dividend policy sustainable?
What tyPE of external financing does the company rely on? Equity, short-term
debt, or long-term debt? Is the financing consistent with the company's overall
business risk?
Does the company have excess cash flow after making capital investments? Is it a
long-term trend? What plans does management have to deploy the free cash flow?
While the information in reported cash flow statements can be used to answer the
above questions directly in the case of some firms, it may not be easy to always do so
for a number of reasons. FIRSt, even though SFAS 95 provides bROAd guidelines on the
format of a cash flow statement, there is still significant variation across firms in how
cash flow data are disclosed. Therefore, to facilitate a systematic analysis and comparison
across firms, analysts often recast the information in the cash flow statement using their
own cash flow model. SECond, firms include interest exPEnse and interest income in
computing their cash flow from oPErating activities. However, these two items are not
strictly related to a firm's oPErations. Interest exPEnse is a function of financial leverage,
and interest income is derived from financial assets rather than oPErating assets. Therefore it is useful to restate the cash flow statement to take this into account.
Analysts use a number of different appROAches to restate the cash flow data. One such
model is shown in Table 5-11. This presents cash flow from oPErations in two stages.
The fIRSt step computes cash flow from oPErations before oPErating working capital
investments. In computing this cash flow, the model excludes interest exPEnse and interest income. To compute this number starting with a firm's net income, an analyst adds
back three tyPEs of items: (1) after-tax net interest exPEnse because this is a financing
item that will be considered later; (2) non-oPErating gains or losses typically arising out
of asset disposals or asset write-offs because these items are investment related and will
be considered later; and (3) long-term oPErating accruals such as depreciation and
deferred taxes because these are non-cash oPErating charges.
Several factors affect a firm's ability to generate positive cash flow from oPErations.
Healthy firms that are in a steady state should generate more cash from their customers than they sPEnd on oPErating exPEnses. In contrast, growing firms--esPEcially
those with heavy outlays for research and development, advertising and marketing, or
building an organization to sustain future growth--may exPErience negative oPErating
cash flow. Firms' working capital management also affects whether they generate positive cash flow from oPErations. Firms in the growing stage typically use cash flow for

oPErating working capital items such as funding customers (accounts receivable) and
purchasing inventories (net of accounts payable financing from suppliers). Net investments in working capital are a function of firms' credit policies (accounts receivable),
payment policies (payables, prepaid exPEnses, and accrued liabilities), and exPEcted
growth in sales (inventories). Thus, in interpreting firms' cash flow from oPErations
after working capital, it is important to keep in mind their growth strategy, industry
characteristics, and credit policies.
The cash flow analysis model next focuses on cash flows related to long-term investments. These investments take the form of capital exPEnditures, intercorporate investments, and mergers and acquisitions. Any positive oPErating cash flow after making
oPErating working capital
investments allows the firm to pursue long-term growth
opportunities. If the firm's oPErating cash flows after working capital investments are
not sufficient to finance its long-term investments, it has to rely on external financing
to fund its growth. Such firms have less flexibility to pursue long-term investments
than those that can fund their growth internally. There are both costs and benefits
from being able to fund growth internally. The cost is that managers can use the internally generated free cash flow to fund unprofitable investments. Such wasteful capital
exPEnditures are less likely if managers are forced to rely on external capital suppliers.
However, reliance on external capital markets may make it difficult for managers to
5-26 PART 2 Business Analysis and Valuation Tools
undertake long-term risky investments if it is not easy to communicate to the capital
markets the benefits from such investments.
Any excess cash flow after these long-term investments is free cash flow that is
available for both debt holders and equity holders. Debt cash transactions include
interest payments and principal payments as well as new borrowing. Cash flow after
payments to debt holders is free cash flow available to equity holders. Cash transactions involving shareholders include dividend payments and stock repurchases, as well
as issues of new equity.
Firms with negative free cash flow to both debt and equity have to borrow additional
funds to meet their interest and debt repayment obligations, cut dividend payments, or
issue additional equity. Managers of firms in this situation are often reluctant to cut dividends for fear that it will be viewed negatively by investors. While this may be feasible in
the short term, it is not prudent for a firm to continue to pay dividends to equity holders
unless it has a positive free cash flow on a sustained basis. In contrast, firms with large
positive free cash flow to debt and equity run the risk of making unproductive investments to pursue growth for its own sake. An analyst, therefore, should carefully examine
the investment plans of such firms.
The model in Table 5-11 suggests that the analyst should focus on a number of cash
flow measures: (1) cash flow from oPErations before investment in working capital and
interest payments, to examine whether or not the firm is able to generate a cash surplus
from oPErations; (2) cash flow from oPErations after investment in working capital, to
assess how the firm's working capital is being managed and whether or not it has the
flexibility to invest in long-term assets for future growth; (3) free cash flow available to
debt and equity holders, to assess a firm's ability to meet its interest and principal payments; and (4) free cash flow available to equity holders, to assess the firm's financial
ability to sustain its dividend policy and to identiFY potential agency problems from
excess free cash flow. These measures have to be evaluated in the context of the company's business, its growth strategy, and its financial policies. Further, changes in these
measures from year to year provide valuable information on the stability of the cash flow
dynamics of the firm.
Key Analysis Questions
The cash flow model in Table 5-11 can also be used to assess a firm's earnings quality. The reconciliation of a firm's net income with its cash flow from oPErations
facilitates this exercise. Following are some of the questions an analyst can probe
in this resPEct:
Are there significant differences between a firm's net income and its oPErating
cash flow? Is it possible to clearly identiFY the sources of this difference? Which
accounting policies contribute to this difference? Are there any one-time events
contributing to this difference?
Is the relationship between cash flow and net income changing over time? Why?
Is it because of changes in business conditions or because of changes in the
firm's accounting policies and estimates?
What is the time lag between the recognition of revenues and exPEnses and the
receipt and disbursement of cash flows? What tyPE of uncertainties need to be
resolved in between?
Are the changes in receivables, inventories, and payables normal? If not, is there
adequate explanation for the changes?
Financial Analysis 5-27
Finally, as we will discuss in Chapter 7, free cash flow available to debt and equity and
free cash flow available to equity are critical inputs into the cash-flow-based valuation of
firms' assets and equity, resPEctively.
Analysis of TJX's and Nordstrom's Cash Flow
Both TJX and Nordstrom reported their cash flows using the indirect cash flow statement. Table 5-11 recasts these statements using the appROAch discussed above so that
we can analyze the two companies' cash flow dynamics.
The cash flow analysis presented in Table 5-11 shows that on an As Reported basis
TJX had an oPErating cash flow before working capital investments of $2.114 billion in
2010. The difference between its earnings and this cash flow is attributable primarily to
depreciation and amortization charges, which is a non-cash exPEnse that is included in
the company's income statement. TJX made a small net investment in oPErating working
capital (the result of increases in accounts receivable and inventory netted out against
increases in accounts payable, income taxes payable, and inventory) resulting in an oPErating cash flow before investment in long-term assets of $2.109 billion for 2010. Investment in store renovations and improvements, fit ups for new stores, and expansion of
office and distribution centers comprised the bulk of net investment in oPErating
long-term assets of $708.2 million, resulting in a free cash flow available to debt and
equity of $1.4 billion in 2010. Netting out a small amount of after-tax net interest income
and debt repayment resulted in a free cash flow available to equity of $1.37 billion. As part
of an ongoing share repurchase program, TJX repurchased roughly $1.0 billion in shares.
That, combined with a dividend of $229.3 million resulted in a net increase of cash of
$127.2 million in 2010. Generally, TJX had a strong cash flow situation in 2010, as it was
able to fund its rapid expansion, an increasing dividend to shareholders, and an aggressive
share repurchase program while increasing its cash balance.
Nordstrom's As Reported oPErating cash flow before working capital investments was
$1.16 billion in 2010. By liquidating $99 million of oPErating capital mainly through
increases in accounts payable and other liabilities (partially offset by increases in
accounts receivable and inventory), Nordstrom was able to generate $1.26 billion in
oPErating cash flow before investment in long-term assets. Like TJX, Nordstrom invested
heavily in its expansion, leaving free cash flow available to debt and equity of $793.6 million
in 2010. Net proceeds from a $500 million debt issue, an increase in short-term borrowings,
and the reduction in after-tax net interest exPEnse resulted in free cash flow available to
equity of $894 million. Like TJX, Nordstrom issued a dividend and bought back a small
amount of stock, resulting in a net increase in its cash balance of $711 million.
As discussed in Chapter 4 and shown in Table 5-11, bringing the oPErating leases
onto the balance sheet as capital leases boosts net income. It also increases oPErating
cash flows as adjustments for depreciation and the increase in deferred tax liability are
included in long-term oPErating accruals. In the investments segment, investments in
long-term assets increase as new lease agreements are entered and capitalized. Finally,
in the financing SECtion, net debt issuance increases as debt is added from newly capitalized leases and annual payments are made for principal and interest (after-tax).
SUMMARY
This chapter presents two key tools of financial analysis: ratio analysis and cash flow
analysis. Both these tools allow the analyst to examine a firm's PErformance and its
financial condition given its strategy and goals. Ratio analysis involves assessing the
firm's income statement and balance sheet data. Cash flow analysis relies on the firm's
5-28 PART 2 Business Analysis and Valuation Tools
cash flow statement. In this chapter we applied these tools to TJX and Nordstrom in
order to compare the two firms' PErformance on both an As Reported and As Adjusted
(for the use of off-balance sheet oPErating leases) basis.
The starting point for ratio analysis is the company's ROE. The next step is to evaluate the three drivers of ROE, which are net profit margin, asset turnover, and financial leverage. Net profit margin reflects a firm's oPErating management, asset turnover
reflects its investment management, and financial leverage reflects its financing policies.
Each of these areas can be further probed by examining a number of ratios. For example, common-sized income statement analysis allows a detailed examination of a firm's
net margins. Similarly, turnover of key working capital accounts such as accounts
inventory, and accounts payable, and turnover of the firm's fixed assets,
receivable,
allow further examination of a firm's asset utilization. Finally, short-term liquidity
ratios, debt policy ratios, and coverage ratios provide a means of examining a firm's
financial leverage.
A firm's sustainable growth rate--the rate at which it can grow without altering its
oPErating, investment, and financing policies--is determined by its ROE and its dividend
policy. The concept of sustainable growth provides a way to integrate the different elements of ratio analysis and to evaluate whether or not a firm's growth strategy is sustainable. If a firm's plans call for growing at a rate above its current sustainable rate, then
one can analyze which of the firm's ratios is likely to change in the future.
Cash flow analysis supplements ratio analysis in examining a firm's oPErating
activities, investment management, and financial risks. Firms in the United States are
currently required to report a cash flow statement summarizing their oPErating, investment, and financing cash flows. Firms in other countries typically report working capital
flows, but it is possible to use this information to create a cash flow statement.
Since there are wide variations across firms in the way cash flow data are reported, analysts often use a standard format to recast cash flow data. We discussed one such cash flow
model in this chapter. This model allows the analyst to assess whether a firm's oPErations
generate cash flow before investments in oPErating working capital, and how much cash is
being invested in the firm's working capital. It also enables the analyst to calculate the
firm's free cash flow after making long-term investments, which is an indication of the
firm's ability to meet its debt and dividend payments. Finally, the cash flow analysis
shows how the firm is financing itself, and whether its financing patterns are too risky.
The insights gained from analyzing a firm's financial ratios and its cash flows are
valuable in forecasting the firm's future prosPEcts.

3. James Broker, an analyst with an established brokerage firm, comments: "The critical number I look at for any company is oPErating cash flow. If cash flows are less
than earnings, I consider a company to be a poor PErformer and a poor investment
prosPEct." Do you agree with this assessment? Why or why not?

4. In computing ROE, one can either use the beginning equity, ending equity, or an
average of the two. Conceptually, the average equity is appropriate, particularly for
this computational
rapidly growing companies. However,
choice makes little difference as long as the analyst is consistent. Therefore, in practice most analysts use ending balances for simplicity. This comment applies to all
ratios discussed in this chapter where one of the items in the ratio is a flow variable
(items in the income statement or cash flow statement) and the other item is a stock
variable (items in the balance sheet). Throughout this chapter we use the beginning
balances of the stock variables.
for most companies,
5. We discuss in greater detail in Chapter 8 how to estimate a company's cost of equity
capital.
6. Strictly sPEaking, part of a cash balance is needed to run the firm's oPErations, so
only the excess cash balance should be viewed as negative debt. However, firms do
not provide information on excess cash, so we subtract all cash balances in our definitions and computations. An alternative possibility is to subtract only short-term
investments and ignore the cash balance completely.

Practice," Review of Accounting Studies 6 (2001): 109-154, for a more detailed
description of this appROAch.

11. See Taxes and Business Strategy by M. Scholes and M. Wolfson (Englewood Cliffs,
NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1992).
12. If firms that are analyzed use different inventory methods, the analyst can adjust to
a common method for computing inventory turnover and days' inventory. This can
be accomplished by adjusting LIFO inventory and LIFO cost of sales to FIFO values
using disclosures on the effect of LIFO inventory valuation in the inventory footnote
disclosure.
13. There are a number of issues related to the calculation of these ratios in practice.
FIRSt, in calculating all the turnover ratios, the assets used in the calculations can
either be beginning of the year values, year-end values, or an average of the beginning and ending balances in a year. We use the beginning of the year values in our
calculations. SECond, strictly sPEaking, one should use credit sales to calculate
accounts receivable turnover and days' receivables. But since it is usually difficult to
obtain data on credit sales, total sales are used instead. Similarly, in calculating
accounts payable turnover or days' payables, cost of goods sold is substituted for
purchases for data availability reasons.
14. Changes in cash and marketable SECurities are excluded because this is the amount
being explained by the cash flow statement. Changes in short-term debt and the current portion of long-term debt are excluded because these accounts represent financing flows, not oPErating flows.
APPENDIX A THE TJX COMPANIES, INC. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Financial Analysis 5-31
We present here for reference Standardized and Condensed financial statements for
TJX, on both an As Reported and As Adjusted (as detailed in the chapter) basis. It is
important to note that "As Reported" and "As Adjusted" refers to the numbers
included in the statements--as noted previously, the Standardized and Condensed
financial statement formats have been develoPEd as a way to facilitate comparison
and forecasting, and differ from the format presented by a sPEcific company in its filings. Also note that the standardized statements shown below are generated by the
BAV software tool and based on data reported by the Thomson ONE database, which
makes minor modifications to the data as reported by the firm. As a consequence, the
standardized statements shown below will not be an exact match to the standardized
statements shown in the apPEndix to Chapter 4, which were manually compiled to
illustrate the general methodology of creating standardized statements. Finally, As
Adjusted statements show differences from As Reported statements only in the years
(FY 2010 for income and cash flow statements, FY 2011 and 2010 for beginning balance sheets) where adjustments have been made.
