Ribbon views this as a substantial replacement opportunity, with the Metaswitch installed base representing over $75 million in annual maintenance revenue, and individual deals ranging from a

Ribbon's financial performance in recent quarters reflects the successful execution of its strategic initiatives.
The company achieved record quarterly revenue in Q2 2025, reaching $220.6 million, a 15% increase year-over-year.
This was driven by robust demand in North America across service provider and enterprise verticals, including U.S. federal agencies.
Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter also saw a significant jump, increasing 47% year-over-year to $32 million, landing at the high end of guidance.

The Cloud & Edge segment continues to be a primary growth engine, with Q2 2025 sales growing 24% year-over-year to $137 million, and adjusted EBITDA increasing 43% to $37 million.
This growth was largely fueled by a record quarter with Verizon, where the multi-year voice transformation program is progressing well, and strong sales to U.S. federal agencies.
For the full year 2024, Cloud & Edge sales grew 6% to $505 million, with adjusted EBITDA up 16% to $141 million.

The IP Optical Networks segment also demonstrated sequential improvement, with Q2 2025 revenue of $83.5 million, up 13% sequentially and 2% year-over-year.

Liquidity remains a key focus.
As of June 30, 2025, Ribbon held $62 million in cash and cash equivalents, down from $90 million at the end of 2024, primarily due to higher working capital needs from increased sales, capital expenditures, and share repurchases.
The company's net debt leverage ratio stood at 2.3x.
A recent tax bill passed by Congress is expected to provide a near-term cash tax savings of approximately $15 million to $20 million for 2025.

Ribbon also initiated a $50 million share repurchase program in Q2 2025, repurchasing $2.3 million in shares, signaling management's confidence in the company's financial health and future cash generation.

Ribbon's outlook for 2025 remains positive, with management projecting continued profitable growth.
For the full year 2025, the company anticipates revenue in the range of $870 million to $890 million, implying a consolidated year-over-year growth rate of approximately 5% at the midpoint.
Adjusted EBITDA is projected to be between $130 million and $140 million, representing a 13% increase at the midpoint compared to 2024.
This guidance assumes a seasonally stronger second half, with revenue increasing 15% to 20% compared to the first half, and the fourth quarter expected to be the strongest of the year.
Specifically for Q3 2025, Ribbon projects revenue in the range of $213 million to $227 million and non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA between $28 million and $34 million.
The Cloud & Edge segment's revenue is expected to be consistent with Q2 2025 levels, with higher enterprise and U.S. federal sales offsetting lower equipment revenue from U.S. Tier 1 service providers like Verizon, where professional service revenue is expected to remain strong.
