"A manufacturing company reported $150 million in net income last year and has 25 million shares outstanding. With a current market price of $90 per share, is the stock undervalued or overvalued based on its P/E ratio compared to an industry average of 18?",,,,,,,"Explain your reasoning.
Answer: A PE ratio of $90 / $6 = 15. This indicates that the stock is currently trading at a discount relative to an industry average of 18. Thus, the stock seems to be undervalued. The low PE ratio may indicate that the firm is going through a restructuring phase, which increases risk, thus resulting in a lower price-to-earnings multiple. Alternatively, it could signal a more conservative forecast from analysts about future earnings growth potential. To assess whether the stock really is undervalued or just mispriced, one must know how many years into the future the PE ratio should be adjusted for growth expectations. If a PE ratio already reflects the exPEcted growth rate of the firm, then it may not necessarily imply that the stock is undervalued. Analysts tend to use multiples that reflect exPEcted earnings (including exPEcted capital gains) rather than historical earnings. Therefore, using only historical earnings to estimate a PE ratio provides an incomplete picture of the firm's valuation prospects. In this case, the current PE ratio reflects the analyst's expectation of future earnings growth, so a decrease in the PE ratio may actually be a positive sign. This suggests that the stock is likely being valued fairly given the level of growth expectations, and the PE ratio may not have been reduced to its fundamental value yet. Analysts who incorporate growth expectations into their PE calculations are likely to see the PE ratio fall back toward its fair level as the firm begins to generate higher returns. For instance, if a firm is growing rapidly but exPEcts to slow down in the next several years, investors will demand a premium to account for that risk. As the firm slows down and becomes less risky, they will reduce the PE ratio to reflect the decrease in risk. However, this PE calculation assumes that there are no changes in risk exposure. It is important to consider whether the PE ratio already includes all of these factors. Since analysts generally use forward exPEctations of future earnings when calculating PE ratios, it is possible that the PE ratio is simply reflecting the analyst's forecast for future earnings rather than the actual earnings that were generated by the firm. Thus, the PE ratio may not provide useful information for assessing current stock valuation. In summary, while a PE ratio of 15 appears to be somewhat lower than the industry average of 18, it may not necessarily mean that the stock is undervalued. One must also take into account the firm's growth expectations."

A SaaS company earned $80 million in EBITDA and has $20 million in net debt. Comparable companies trade at an average EV/EBITDA multiple of 12. What is the implied equity value of the business?,,,,,,,"(Assume that no cash or marketable securities are held.) A) $1,600 million B) $1,400 million C) $900 million D) $700 million The correct answer was: A. An analyst estimates a firm's value by multiplying its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and other exPEnses (EBITDA) by the market multiples for firms in the same industry. This estimate may be adjusted upward for higher leverage ratios and downward for lower leverage ratios if there are differences among firms in their capital structure. Analysts often use a market-to-book value ratio as well to estimate a firm's value. The current value of a firm can also be estimated by using the discounted free cash flow model. Under this model, the value of the firm equals the present value of future free cash flows generated from its assets. Free cash flows are cash flows available to all investors after capital expenditures on long-lived assets have been made. Free cash flows are calculated as follows: Free Cash Flow = Earnings Before Interest ExPEnes and Taxes + Depreciation - Capital ExPEnse - Increases in Working Capital. In many instances, capital exPEnse is equal to depreciation. However, capital exPEnse may also include purchases of other nondepreciable assets such as land and buildings. If capital exPEnse exceeds depreciation, then the increase in working capital must be subtracted as it reduces the amount of free cash flow available to the firm. If capital exPEnse is less than depreciation, then decreases in working capital will add to the firm's free cash flow. Free cash flows can be discounted at a cost of capital that includes the risk-free rate plus a risk premium to reflect the uncertainty involved with each future cash flow. Alternatively, analysts can discount free cash flows using the cost of debt plus the cost of equity. When calculating the implied value of a firm using the multiples method, analysts should consider whether they are using earnings multiples or cash flow multiples. If they are using earnings multiples, they need to assess whether these multiples are consistent with the firm's current capital structure. If they are using cash flow multiples, they do not necessarily need to adjust the multiples for differences in capital structures because cash flow multiples are based on the cash flows generated from the underlying business. Because we are using a cash flow multiple rather than an earnings multiple, we do not need to worry about capital structure differences. The question asks us to compute the implied"

"A retail company reports free cash flows of $25M, $28M, $31M, $34M, and $37M over the next five years. Assuming a terminal growth rate of 3% and a WACC of 9%, estimate the intrinsic value using a discounted cash flow model.",,,,,,,"Assume that the firm will continue to grow at its current rate forever after year 5. Do not include any adjustments for changes in working capital or other balance sheet items in your DCF analysis. Also assume no debt on the balance sheet or any other financing activities. Note: The question is somewhat ambiguous about whether the growth rates are exPEcted to be constant indefinitely (which would imply a perpetual growth rate) or if they are just projected to increase over time but then stabilize at some level beyond year 5 (in which case we use the last growth rate). For simplicity, we will proceed with the assumption that growth rates are constant beyond year 5. In that case, the terminal growth rate of 3% can be used as an estimate of the perpetual growth rate in dividends beyond year 5. Alternatively, one could use the growth rate implied by the last forecast year. If we do this, we get a lower valuation of $609 million compared to the $615 million discussed above. Because it's somewhat arbitrary how one estimates the growth rate in each scenario, it's useful to note that these two assumptions have little effect on the overall estimate given the range of possible growth rates that could be reasonable. Thus, we can conclude that the intrinsic value is approximately $620 million. Analysts should consider using a terminal value based on a perpetuity with growth rather than a PEriodic payment stream when the future dividend payments will likely differ from the growth rate being assumed. This situation is most common for firms where earnings and dividends are expected to fluctuate significantly. In such cases, analysts often compute a terminal value assuming growth rates of zero thereafter and then add the estimated value of the firm's assets at the end of the forecast period. A more accurate approach may be to combine both approaches when computing the intrinsic value. However, a number of firms provide data on growth rates that indicate that their earnings and dividends are likely to remain fairly constant over time. As a result, analysts who use a terminal value based on a growing perpetuity tend to report slightly higher intrinsic values than those who use a growing PEriodic payment stream. Thus, it is important to understand how each method works so that you can decide which one to use for a particular firm. It also helps to know the implications of each method for estimating intrinsic value. One thing to remember is that a growing PEriodic payment stream has two components: the present value of the PEriodic cash flows and the present value of the residual value. Similarly,"

## Chapter Summary and Review Questions

### Key Terms and Concepts Covered

| Concept | Description | Example of Use | Impact on Valuation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Enterprise Value (EV) | A firm's total market capitalization plus debt minus cash balance. | EV = Market Capitalization + Debt - Cash Balance | The numerator of most multiples such as P/E, P/S, EV/EBITDA, etc., are based on the concept of enterprise value. |
| Equity Value (EV) | Total enterprise value less debt and less cash. | Equity Value = Enterprise Value - Debt - Cash Balance | Dividends paid by a firm are typically calculated using the earnings generated by the firm's assets. Therefore, analysts can also use equity-based multiples to value equity. |
| Free Cash Flow (FCF) | Net income after interest expenses and tax adjustments plus depreciation minus investment in tangible assets. | FCF = Net Income - Interest Expense(1-Tax Rate) + Depreciation ExPEnse - Net Investment in Tangible Assets | When generating projections for free cash flow, it is important to consider all three sources of free cash flow including net interest exPEnse, taxes, depreciation, and changes in working capital. |
| Discounted Free Cash Flow Analysis | Discounting cash flows (i.e., dividends, free cash flow, or sales growth) back to the present day to compute the intrinsic value of a firm. | Intrinsic Value = PV(Dividend Stream) = PV(Free Cash Flow Stream) = PV(Sales Growth Projection) | This is one of the most popular valuation models because it allows analysts to incorporate"

Finally, calculate the forward P/E ratio assuming earnings are expected to be constant next year. Do you think this calculation provides a good estimate of the future P/E? Why or why not? What would you do to make it better? Does any information suggest that the analyst should use an average PE rather than the current PE for the calculation? Explain your answer. What does the resulting forward P/E mean? In making these calculations, did you assume that dividends will be paid out at 100% of free cash flow? Why or why not? Would that assumption have made the forecast worse? Why or why not? What would you suggest as a way to handle a situation where the dividend payout is less than one? For example, consider the case where some of the firm's free cash flow is used to finance growth by investing in new assets. Discuss how that might influence the analyst's treatment of the dividend payout rate. Do you agree with the analyst's choice of the cost of equity? Why or why not? If you had to choose another cost of equity estimate, which one would you select? Why? Does the analyst account for the riskiness of the cash flows correctly? Is there any reason to believe that the cash flow stream may change? For example, suppose the analyst forecasts that free cash flow will decline during periods when interest rates fall. Should she incorporate such an adjustment into her DCF analysis? Do you see other situations where incorporating changes in the risk profile of the firm into the valuation could affect the outcome? Finally, what effect would the analyst's judgment about growth have on the results? Suppose that the analyst assumes a higher growth rate. How would that impact his calculation? Can he account for this uncertainty in his forecast? Do you see any alternative ways to adjust his forecast beyond just changing the growth rate? Explain your answer.

"A biotech company has no earnings but holds $300M in cash and expects to generate positive FCF starting at $20M in year 4, growing 10% annually. Using a 12% discount rate and assuming a 5% terminal growth rate, estimate the firm’s current value.",,,,,,,"(a) $698M; ($704M; (c) $753M; (d) $761M. (See Appendix A for formulas.)ANSWER: (c). The biotech's market value of equity can be estimated by summing the PV of its FCFs until the growth rate converges to the discount rate plus the present value of the horizon value. Since we are given no information on whether or not the biotech is a private business, we assume that it will be sold to another buyer at a terminal date. We also know that the biotech is unlikely to pay out any dividends in the near term because it currently has no earnings. So, the only way to estimate the firm's market value today is to calculate the present value of its free cash flows. These cash flows have been forecasted as follows:Year 4: $20M; Year 5: $22M; Year 6: $24.2M; Year 7: $26.62M; Year 8: $29.28M; etc. At this point, we need to calculate the value of all these FCFs beginning from year 4 using a constant growth model with a growth rate of 10%. This gives us: Value at year 4 = [FCF / (r - g)] = [20 / (12 - 10)] = $1,000M. To find the PV of all cash flows from year 4 onwards, we must discount this $1,000M back to today. Therefore, the total PV of all cash flows starting in year 4 is $1,000M / (1 + r)^4 = $1,000M / (1.12)^4 = $688.17M. In addition, the biotech has $300M in cash on hand, which adds an additional $300M to our valuation. Thus, the biotech's current value equals $688.17M + $300M = $988.17M. However, because we assumed a perpetual growth rate of 10%, we must also adjust our analysis to take into account the fact that the growth rate is less than the discount rate. If we use a constant-growth model with a growth rate greater than zero, we must"

A healthcare company has projected EBITDA of $120M next year and peers trade at an average EV/EBITDA multiple of 13x. The company holds $40M in cash and has $90M in debt. Estimate the firm’s equity value using a relative valuation approach.,,,,,,,"Show your work. If you think this is a reasonable estimate, explain why. If you have any concerns about it, suggest what could be done to improve the estimate. (5 points) For instance: Firm's equity value = V0 x (EBITDA / market EV/EBITDA) - Debt - Cash = ($120M x 13) - $90M - $40M = $1,560 - $130 = $1,430M. However, we should note that if the firm is very different from its peers, such as having unusually high growth or significantly higher risk than its peer group, then the multiple may not reflect the fair value of the firm. As a result, applying multiples from similar firms to other firms can potentially lead to overvaluation or undervaluation. In addition, we should also consider whether the market PE ratio is driven by fundamentals. If so, then the valuation based on the PE ratio would reflect the intrinsic value of the firm. Otherwise, a PE ratio based on price-to-book, for instance, might be more useful. Also, there are risks related to using forward multiples, including the possibility that earnings will fall below forecast levels or that future dividends will not be paid out. To mitigate these risks, analysts could use recent historical data instead of forward projections. In our example above, we assumed that the average EV/EBITDA multiple for the peer group is 13x. Analysts could assess the average of past EV/EBITDA multiples rather than current ones, because EV/EBITDA multiples tend to be highly volatile due to the effect of changes in the interest rate environment. To avoid the potential distortions caused by volatility, they could also calculate the mean of the trailing EV/EBITDA multiple. Additionally, when calculating the mean, analysts could use the weighted average of past multiples, where weights reflect the degree of confidence in each multiple. In our example, we could recalculate the value using the following formula: Firm's equity value = V0 x (trailing EV/EBITDA x b + forward EV/EBITDA x (1 - b)) - Debt - Cash, where b reflects the weight assigned to trailing multiples. For instance, if the analyst assigns 70% weight to trailing EV/EBITDA multiples, then the new value would be ($120M x (13 x 0.7 + 14 x 0.3))"

How could you incorporate the forecasted change in the discount rate into your DCF analysis? Does it make sense to incorporate this adjustment? Why or why not? Does the adjusted rate result in a greater or smaller valuation than the original one? Is it reasonable to use the adjusted rates? Would it have been better to project cash flows for six years instead of five? If so, how would you adjust your cash flow estimates? Explain your reasoning. The answer will vary depending on the assumptions made. However, the following outline of steps can help you construct an appropriate response: Step 1: Compute the present value of each year's free cash flow (the first four years) under the base case. Step 2: Compute the present value of the fifth year's free cash flow ($45M) under the base case, and compute the present value of the value at the end of Year 5 based on the terminal multiple and growth rate assumptions used in the base case. Step 3: Compute the present value of the fifth year's free cash flow and the present value of the value at the end of Year 5 under the adjusted discount rate. Also recompute the present value of the value at the end of Year 5 based on the adjusted growth rate assumption. Step 4: Recompute the adjusted value at the end of Year 5, based on the discounted cash flows from Years 6 onward. Compute the present value of these cash flows. Step 5: Add all together the values computed in Steps 1-4 to arrive at the enterprise value of the firm under the adjusted discount rates. You may want to summarize all the components separately rather than just computing them individually. Finally, you should discuss whether incorporating the adjusted rates makes sense. For example, if the riskiness of cash flows increases over time, the discount"

A manufacturing firm retains 60% of its $80M annual earnings and has an ROE of 12%. Estimate its sustainable growth rate and discuss how this might influence a long-term DCF model.,,,,,,,"(Note: Use the DuPont formula to estimate ROE.) Does the result suggest that a change in dividend policy would be likely to affect the firm's cost of equity? Why or why not? Discuss the effect on the DCF model of increasing the retention ratio from 60% to 90%, keeping all other factors constant. What are the implications for investors who anticipate that the company will increase its retention ratios over time? Do these estimates imply that the firm is growing indefinitely at an increasing rate? If so, what could cause that trend? What is the financial implication of such a development? Explain. Finally, assume that the firm uses its retained earnings to pay off debt. Re-estimate its sustainable growth rate under that scenario. How does this compare with your original estimate? Why do you think the numbers differ? Do you think this is indicative of any of the problems discussed in Chapter 4 about estimating growth rates? Explain. What would you recommend that the analyst do in such situations? Is the DCF method still useful if the firm's growth rate is increasing over time? Explain. In view of your analysis, which of the two scenarios (paying out dividends versus using earnings to reduce debt) should the analyst use? Explain your reasoning. What would be the effect of decreasing the debt-to-equity ratio by paying dividends instead of repaying debt on the market value of equity? Explain why. Do you see any potential ethical issues with using a DCF approach when a firm is likely to have debt that is likely to default? What factors might lead to such default risk? Under what circumstances would you consider it necessary to incorporate credit risk into the DCF valuation model? What measures could help estimate such risk? Explain. Finally, what are some alternative models available to analysts who have serious concerns about incorporating credit risk into their DCF models? Which of these models might provide more accurate results? Explain. Write a brief summary of this chapter's discussion. Identify the key concepts presented and highlight those that are most relevant to financial statement analysis. Explain how each concept can be applied to assess firms' financial positions and to make investment decisions. Note that no one model provides the entire picture; rather, we must combine different approaches. Discuss the importance of combining different techniques to arrive at consistent forecasts of future cash flows. This chapter presents three methods for forecasting cash flow: financial statements based on historical trends, comparable firm data, and forward-looking forecasts. Explain the advantages and disadvantages of each. Can they be combined? Explain. What factors can distort"

Why? How might you adjust for this? Explain your rationale and assumptions clearly.

The firm's current debt-to-capital ratio is 60% and target level is 70%. Current net debt is $400M. The interest rate on its outstanding debt is 8%, and it pays a dividend yield of 3%. Calculate the terminal value based on EBITDA multiples. Calculate the value of operations from the following: beginning book value of net debt of $200M. Net debt at the end of the forecast period will be $300M. Debt issuance can occur at any time during the forecast period. Debt repayment occurs at the end of the forecast period only if needed to finance new capital expenditures. Net working capital growth (or shrink) equals zero. There is no change in long-term liabilities. The tax rate is 30%. The weighted average cost of capital is 9%. The debt to equity ratio should not exceed 80%. Would you recommend financing with more or less debt? Why? Are there any reasons that would suggest the firm could be financed fully by debt? Explain.

Explain how each of the following factors affects the calculation of free cash flow available to equity holders: changes in accounts payable, changes in inventory, the depreciation method used, amortization of intangible assets, interest exPEnse, taxes paid, dividends paid, and capital expenditures. Do these factors affect the discount rate or the valuation model? Should they be adjusted prior to estimating them? Why?

You are evaluating whether a firm is generating abnormal earnings before interest and taxes, which is also known as residual income. You have estimated that the fair market value of the firm's stock is equal to its book value plus one year of earnings. Under what circumstances would you conclude that the firm is generating abnormal earnings? Under what conditions would you conclude that the firm is not generating abnormal earnings? Explain your reasoning thoroughly.

Evaluate the implications for valuation if all of the following statements are true: the firm has a stable payout ratio of 50% and is growing at a constant rate of 5%, the beta coefficient of the firm is 1.2, the risk-free rate of return is 4%, the required return on the market portfolio is 8%, the tax rate is 40%, the cost of debt is 7%, the growth rate of the dividends is 5%, and the current PE ratio is 18 times"
"A retail business recently restructured its capital with a 70/30 debt-to-equity ratio. Discuss how the new capital structure affects WACC and firm valuation, especially in light of rising interest rates and $25M in annual interest payments.",,,,,,,"Would it be more valuable to use a market-based discount rate or a cost-of-capital based discount rate? Explain your reasoning. What other factors do you think could affect the valuation of this firm, aside from those discussed above? Do they matter? Why or why not? Finally, given your analysis, would you change your investment recommendation on this stock? Why or why not? Based on our analysis we would not recommend that investors buy shares of this company. The recent restructuring of the firm's capital has lowered its debt-to-equity ratio. However, this move will increase the cost of equity, which is the main source of financing for a retail business. With increased interest rates, the firm will face higher borrowing costs. As a result, the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of the firm increases significantly. In addition, the firm may find that it is difficult to raise long-term capital through traditional channels such as issuing bonds and common stocks. These factors together will reduce the value of the firm. The valuation using the cost of capital based discount rate is lower than that using the market-based discount rate because the cost of capital reflects the firm's own risk characteristics and market conditions rather than the market risk premium. This means that the firm's value under the market-based discount rate is higher. We believe that the other factors can have significant effects on the valuation of the firm. For example, if the firm's earnings growth rate declines, the present value of future cash flows decreases, and the value of the firm reduces. Similarly, an increase in the beta coefficient makes the cost of equity higher, which also reduces the value of the firm. As these factors are important and have significant impacts, they should be considered when evaluating the valuation of a firm. Given the analysis above, we would not recommend buying shares of this company. Our view is that the risks associated with a retail business make it difficult to achieve the desired returns. Additionally, the current economic environment presents many challenges for firms in the retail industry. Investors should carefully consider the potential gains and losses before investing in this company. Overall, it is crucial to understand the firm's financial position, strategic goals, and future prospects. By doing so, investors can better decide whether to invest in the firm or not.
The analysis highlights the importance of considering the various factors that influence the valuations of companies. Firms in the retail sector face increasing pressure due to the rise in interest rates and other macroeconomic factors. A decrease in the value of debt ratios and an increase in the cost of capital both"
"A REIT reports $100M in retained earnings and pays out 90% of its net income as dividends. Using the residual income valuation model, estimate equity value assuming a required return of 10% and a forecasted ROE of 11%.",,,,,,,"Assume that no new capital expenditures are made, nor is any debt issued or redeemed. If the firm was not restricted to pay dividends from retained earnings but could also issue shares and pay dividends from cash flow, how would the value change? What if there were capital exPEnditures equal to retained earnings growth? Why does this matter? (Assume all other variables remain the same.)45 Reinvesting earnings at a rate of growth g generates additional equity value equal to [(ROE - r)/r] x [g x E]/[1 + g]. So the total value is equal to: Value = E x [1/(r)] x (ROE - r) x [(1)/(1 + g)] + [g x E]/(1 + g). But note that since dividends are paid out at a rate of (1 - g), then [g x E]/(1 + g) = D/(1 + g). Therefore, we can write: Value = [E x (ROE - r)]/[r x (1 + g)] + D/(1 + g). Which is the dividend discount model with dividends growing at a constant rate g. Similarly, if a firm pays out some portion, but not all, of its earnings as dividends, we can write the value as follows: Value = [E x (ROE - r)]/[r x (1 + g)] + D/(1 + g). Note that this expression is equivalent to the dividend discount model where dividends grow at a rate g, which reflects reinvestment of earnings growth. Thus, when a firm invests its earnings, it increases future dividends by investing these earnings, thus increasing the dividend stream and therefore, the value. Conversely, if a firm has no growth, so g = 0, then the value will be equal to E x (ROE - r)/r. In such a case, the value equals the present value of earnings discounted at the cost of capital minus the PV of the return on equity that will have been generated over time. But since no earnings are paid out, the present value of the return on equity is also zero. Hence, the value equals the present value of the earnings stream only. In summary, the two models are equivalent, and both show that the present value of equity is the sum of the PV of retained earnings and the PV of dividends. As a result, firms can choose between different ways to distribute their earnings. By paying more dividends early, they can generate higher dividends later,"
"A company has $300M in goodwill on its balance sheet and recently recorded a $50M impairment. How should this non-cash charge affect intrinsic valuation, and what adjustments, if any, should be made in a DCF or comparables analysis?",,,,,,,"Explain your reasoning.
