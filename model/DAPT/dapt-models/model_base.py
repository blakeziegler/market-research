    "You're an equity analyst evaluating the intrinsic value of a software company. "
    "The company has $1.2 billion in trailing twelve-month revenue, a net income margin of 18%, and a free cash flow margin of 22%. "
    "Free cash flow is expected to grow at 10% annually over the next five years. Comparable firms in the sector trade at a P/E ratio of 30. "
    "The company holds $150 million in cash and has $100 million in debt. The appropriate discount rate for this business is 9%. "
    "Using only this information, forecast the company's free cash flows for the next five years and discount them to present value. "
    "Then calculate the terminal value using a P/E-based approach on year 5 earnings. Add the present value of cash flows and terminal value to arrive at the total firm value. "
    "Subtract net debt to get the equity value. Conclude by interpreting whether this business appears undervalued or overvalued if it currently trades at a $6.8 billion market cap, "
    "and briefly discuss how sensitive the valuation is to assumptions like P/E ratio, FCF growth, and profit margins.\n\n"
